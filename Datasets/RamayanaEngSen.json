["The Sage Valmiki, chief among the munis and the most eloquent of men, constantly engaged in the practice of selfcontrol and the study of the holy scriptures, enquired of Shri Narada:\u2014", "\u201cWho is there in the world to-day, endowed with excellent and heroic qualities, who is versed in all the duties of life, grateful, truthful, firm in his vows, an actor of many parts, benevolent to all beings, learned, eloquent, handsome, patient, slow to anger, one who is truly great; who is free from envy and when excited to wrath can strike terror into the hearts of celestial beings? O Sage, I would hear of such a man from you, who art able to describe him to me.\u201d", "Narada, acquainted with the past, the present and the future, pleased with the words of the Sage Valmiki, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cRare indeed are those, endowed with the qualities you have enumerated, yet I can tell you of such a one. Born in the family of Ikshvaku, he is named Rama; one renowned, fully self-controlled, valorous and illustrious, the Lord of All.

Such are his great qualities\u2014Rama, the beloved heir of King Dasaratha, possessing every excellent attribute, benevolent to all, devoted to the welfare of every living being.\u201d", "His father, King Dasaratha, made preparations to install him as his regent, but the Queen Kaikeyi, claiming the boons formerly promised to her, demanded the exile of Rama and the enthronement of her own son Bharata. The king held by his promise and by the ties of honour, sent his son Rama, whom he loved as his own life, into exile. Obeying the command of his royal sire, and in order to gratify Kaikeyi, Shri Rama went to the forest.", "The son of Queen Sumitra, Prince Lakshmana, inspired by affection and humility, followed his brother Rama into exile.", "The daughter of King Janaka, an incarnation of Lakshmi, endowed with the highest feminine virtues, seeing Prince Lakshmana accompanying Rama, obedient to her lord, followed him as Venus follows the moon.", "Accompanied for some leagues by King Dasaratha and his people, Rama dismissed the chariot on reaching the town of Shringavera on the banks of the Ganges, and commanded the minister Sumantra to return to the capital.", "Here the prince met his beloved Guha, the chief of the Chandalas, accompanied by whom, with Lakshmana and Sita, he crossed the river Ganges and entered the forest, arriving at length at the Cittrakuta mountain described by the Sage Bharadvaja. Rama, Lakshmana and Sita dwelt happily in the forest like devas or gandharvas.", "Overwhelmed with grief at the separation from his sons and lamenting their absence, the king departed this life, while Rama was dwelling on the Cittrakuta mountain.", "The holy sages offered the throne, left vacant on the death of King Dasaratha, to Prince Bharata, who declined it, not desiring the kingdom. Setting forth to the forest where Shri Rama dwelt, in order to propitiate him, he approached that hero of truth with humility and directing his attention to the code of justice with which he was conversant, requested Rama to return and govern the kingdom.", "The magnanimous, handsome and mighty Rama refused to accept the throne, preferring to carry out the command of his sire and, presenting Prince Bharata with his sandals as a symbol of authority, repeatedly exhorted him to return to the capital.", "Shri Bharata, touching the feet of Rama in submission, departed and began to rule the dominion from the town of Nandigrama, while eagerly awaiting the return of his brother.", "The sages and hermits, who dwelt in the forest, constantly harassed by asuras, approached Shri Ramacandra to ask for his protection\u2014Shri Rama agreed to slay the evil asuras in order to preserve the Sages who had sought his help. The holy men, whose appearance equalled the fire in lustre, heard of Shri Rama\u2019s resolve and were assured by him of his protection.", "The female asura Shurpanakha, who could assume various forms at will, was overpowered and disfigured by Rama and Lakshmana. All the wicked rakshasas came led by Khara, Dushana and Trishira, to engage in combat with Shri Rama, and were slain by him. Shri Rama slew fourteen thousand rakshasas who dwelt in that forest. Hearing of the slaughter of the rakshasas, King Ravana transported with rage, took with him Marica, a demon like himself. Marica, knowing the superior strength of Rama, sought to dissuade Ravana from entering into combat with him, but Ravana who was marked down by destiny, disregarded the advice and went with Marica to Shri Rama\u2019s abode. There, Marica lured Shri Rama and Lakshmana away from the hermitage, and Ravana, having slain the vulture Jatayu, carried Sita away.", "Learning from the dying Jatayu of the abduction of the daughter of the King of Mithila, Shri Rama was overwhelmed with grief and began to mourn.", "Having performed the funeral rites of the vulture, while wandering in search of Sita, he encountered an asura named Kabandha whose form was menacing and terrible.", "Shri Rama slew him and then performed the funeral rites whereupon his soul ascended to heaven. While passing to the celestial sphere, Kabandha spoke to Rama of Shabari, a female ascetic, and entreated him to visit her. Shri Rama, the ever resplendent Destroyer of his foes, came to where Shabari dwelt and was duly worshipped by her.", "On the banks of the Lake Pampa, Shri Rama met the monkey Hanuman who presented Sugriva to him. The mighty Rama related the whole of his story to him as far as the abduction of Shri Sita. Sugriva having listened to Shri Rama entered into the rite of friendship with him, witnessed by the fire. With full faith in Rama, Sugriva then recounted to him all the sufferings he had endured through his enmity with Bali and the great daring of the latter. Then Shri Rama vowed to slay Bali, but Sugriva, uncertain of Rama\u2019s prowess and desiring to test him, showed him the bones of the body of Dundhubi, forming a heap as high as a mountain. With his foot, Rama kicked the heap to a distance of ten yojanas and, discharging an arrow, pierced seven palmyra trees, cleaving a mountain and with the shaft penetrating to the centre of the earth. Having witnessed this exploit, Sugriva was satisfied, and thereafter trusted Rama implicitly. In his company he passed through deep valleys to the town of Kishkindhya; there, the yellow-eyed Sugriva roared like thunder. At this terrible sound, the powerful and valiant monkey chief, Bali, issued forth, disregarding the warning of his wife Tara, and engaged in combat with Sugriva.", "As desired by Sugriva, Shri Rama slew Bali with a single arrow; then he entrusted the government of Kishkindhya to Sugriva who now, as king of the monkey tribe, gathered his forces together and dispatched them to every quarter in search of Sita.", "The vulture chief, the courageous Sampati, informed Hanuman where Sita was, whereupon the monkey leapt over the sea that lies between Bharatvarsh and Lanka, a distance of five hundred miles.", "Entering the city of Lanka that was protected by Ravana, Hanuman beheld Sita, meditating on Rama in the ashoka garden. He there delivered Rama\u2019s ring to her and acquainted her with the welfare of her lord. Having revived the courage of Sita, he shattered the gate of the garden and slew seven sons of the counsellors of Ravana, five great captains and levelled Akshyakumara, the son of Ravana, to the dust. Then he suffered himself to be taken captive.", "Knowing he could not be subdued by the weapon granted by Brahma to Ravana, yet acknowledging the power of its blessing, Hanuman allowed himself to be imprisoned, suffering many indignities. Subsequently he burnt the whole of Lanka, only sparing the place where Sita dwelt.", "Returning to deliver his welcome tidings, he respectfully circumambulated the mighty Rama and recounted in detail how he had found Sita.", "Setting out in the company of Sugriva and others, Rama reached the sea. There he created a tempest by his shining arrows and the Lord of the waters, Sumudra, appeared before him. Under his direction, Nala threw a bridge over the sea. Crossing the sea by means of this bridge, Shri Rama entered Lanka, slew Ravana in battle and recovered Sita, but she being the subject of slander, was addressed by him with harsh words in the midst of the assembly. After hearing the words of Rama with forbearance, Sita entered a great fire. On the testimony of the fire god, Sita was proved to be innocent and Rama, adored by all the gods, was content.", "The animate and inanimate beings of the three worlds, the gods and the sages, gave thanks that Ravana had been slain by Shri Rama. Shri Rama enthroned Vibishana as the king of the asuras and, being wholly satisfied, revived all the monkeys and asuras who had fallen in battle.", "In the aerial chariot, Pushpaka, accompanied by Sugriva, Shri Rama, a devotee of truth, reached the hermitage of Bharadvaja. From there, he sent Hanuman to Prince Bharata, as his messenger and conversing with Sugriva again mounted the aerial chariot and arrived at Nandigrama.", "Ever obedient to his father, Shri Rama then cut off his matted locks and with Sita occupied the throne of Ayodhya.", "Seeing Shri Rama occupying the throne, the people were happy and satisfied, virtuous and free from sickness, sorrow, famine or danger. None witnessed the death of his son; no woman became a widow and all were devoted to their husbands; there was no danger from tempests; none perished by water; nor was there any cause of fear from fire; fever and plague were unknown; there was no want, and no danger from thieves. Cities and villages were rich and prosperous; all lived happily as in the Satya Yuga.", "Shri Rama and Sita observed countless Vedic sacrifices and gave much gold, and hundreds of thousands of cows in charity, thus preparing for themselves a place in the divine regions. Shri Rama added incalculably to the prosperity of the dynasty, and bestowed immense wealth on the brahmins. He employed his subjects in the duties of their respectives castes and ruled for eleven thousand years, after which he returned to his celestial abode, Vaikuntha.", "He who reads the story of Rama, which imparts merit and purity, is freed from all sin. He who reads it with faith and devotion is ultimately worshipped together with his sons, grandsons and servants at his death.", "A brahmin reading this becomes proficient in the Vedas, and philosophy; a kshatriya becomes a king; a vaishya grows prosperous in trade; a shudra, on reading this will become great in his caste.", "The wise and eloquent Valmiki with his disciple, Bharadvaja, having listened to the words of Narada, was filled with wonder and worshipped Rama in his heart. He offered obeisance to Shri Narada, who craved permission to depart and on his request being granted he ascended through space to the heavens.", "Narada, having departed, the great Muni Valmiki proceeded to the banks of the river Tamasa, which was close to the Ganges. Reaching that place and seeing the pure and limpid waters, Valmiki said to his disciple: \u201cO Bharadvaja, behold how pure is the water of the holy river, verily it is clear and pleasant like the mind of a good man. O Child, set down the waterpot and fetch me my bark robe from the hermitage. I wish to bathe in the sacred stream, delay not.\u201d", "Obedient to the command of his Guru, the disciple brought the raiment from the Sage\u2019s hermitage and returning speedily, offered it to him. Receiving the robe of bark from the hands of his disciple, the sage, with his senses fully controlled, girded it about him and while bathing repeated the traditional prayers, offering libations of water to his ancestors and the gods. Then he wandered about in the forest enjoying the beauties of nature.", "Now the august sage, Shri Valmiki, beheld a pair of Krauncha birds fearlessly disporting themselves in love. Soon after, a fowler stealing up unobserved, slew the male bird in the presence of the sage. The female bird, deprived of her yellow crested companion, who but now had been spreading his wings in the act of love to please her, perceiving him bleeding and crying out in distress, began to mourn.", "The heart of the sage was filled with pity on seeing the bird struck down by the fowler. Touched by the lament of the female krauncha and incensed by the cruel act of the fowler, the sage said: \u201cO Fowler, having killed the bird in the midst of the enjoyment of love with its mate, you shall never attain prosperity. Do not visit the forest for many years lest evil overtake you.\u201d", "Reflecting on the words he had addressed to the fowler and realising their implication, the sage said to himself: \u201cWhat words are these that I have uttered, inspired by my compassion for the dying bird?\u201d", "The wise and learned sage reflected a moment, and then said to his disciple: \u201cGrieving for the dying bird, I have recited this verse of four feet, each of equal syllables, which can be sung to the vina. May it bring me renown and may no ill be spoken of me on account of this.\u201d", "With great delight the disciple committed to memory the verse composed by his spiritual preceptor, who expressed his satisfaction at the skill of his pupil Bharadvaja. Bathing in the sacred river, according to the prescribed ritual, the sage returned to his hermitage, pondering over the matter. The humble and learned disciple Bharadvaja followed the great Sage, carrying his loshta filled with water.", "On entering the hermitage, the sage worshipped the Lord and performed other rituals and having instructed his disciple in the tradition and the sacred history, passed into deep meditation. The Creator of the world, the Self-born, the fourfaced and glorious Brahma at length appeared before the holy sage. Valmiki rose hastily, filled with astonishment, and welcoming the Deity in great humility, offered obeisance to Him. Leading Him to a seat, in profound reverence he poured forth libations of water as enjoined in the tradition, making enquiries as to His welfare. The Blessed Lord accepted the homage offered to Him and commanded the sage to be seated. Shri Valmiki occupied the place designated by Brahma and once more recollected his grief over the incident of the wicked fowler, who ruthlessly slew the bird that was so happy and cooing with delight.", "He recalled the grief of the female bird and read and re-read the lines:\u2014", "\u201cBy the ignorant and wicked fowler, grief is born", "For he has wantonly slain the melodious krauncha.\u201d", "Shri Brahma, seeing the sage afflicted and sorrowful, said to him: \u201cO Great Sage, let these words spontaneously uttered by you, inspired by the death of the krauncha, be poetry. Do you describe the whole story of Rama, who is the essence of virtue and full of the highest attributes, in accordance with what you have heard from Shri Narada. Do you narrate all the known and hitherto unknown deeds of Shri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana and the asuras. Whatever relates to King Dasaratha, his wives, city, palace, sayings, conduct and what he accomplished, will be revealed to you by my favour. None of your words will prove false. Do you render into verse the sacred and delightful deeds of Rama. O Sage, as long as the mountains and rivers remain on the earth, so long will the story of Shri Rama endure. So long as the story of Rama endures, so long shalt you abide in the higher regions.\u201d", "Having uttered these words, Shri Brahma pondered awhile within Himself and then vanished from sight.", "The great sage and his disciple were filled with amazement at this event, and reading the stanza again and again, their delight grew. Repeatedly reciting the couplet, composed by Valmiki, they realised that the holy sage had expressed lbs sorrow in poetic form. Then Shri Valmiki meditated on the Lord within his soul and it occurred to him to relate the story of Rama in similar verse. For the good of the world, the illustrious and holy sage, therefore, began composing the life of Shri Rama in verse; that Rama, worthy of world-wide renown, who is both generous and charming. Shri Valmiki composed the story of the life of Rama and of the slaying of Ravana in beautiful and measured stanzas, a work of infinite merit.", "Having heard the story of the life of the sagacious Rama from the lips of Shri Narada which, when recounted, confers perfect righteousness on the hearer, the holy sage wished to know more concerning the sacred theme. Washing his hands and feet and drinking a little pure water, placing himself facing the east on a seat of kusha grass, with joined palms, he passed into profound meditation and in a vision beheld the history of Rama. Through the grace of Shri Brahma, the holy sage saw all that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had experienced, observed and done. He witnessed in detail the life of Rama, who was truth incarnate and all that he had accomplished in the forest and other places.", "By the power of spiritual meditation and yoga, the Sage Valmiki saw the whole past as clearly as if it were a fruit placed on the palm of his hand. Thus, having witnessed all, the most enlightened sage began to describe the life of Shri Rama in verse.", "The history of Shri Rama, which confers righteousness, worldly prosperity and delight on the reader, which does not degrade the mind and grants release from sorrow, that story which charms the heart and is as full of lovely gems as is the sea, was rendered by Shri Valmiki, in the form in which Shri Narada had related it to him.", "The birth of Rama,", "his valour,", "his benevolence to all men,", "his universal goodwill,", "his clemency,", "his pleasing looks,", "his sweet

Endowed with god-like beauty, the two sweet singers, the reflected images of Shri Rama himself, constantly repeated the holy classic and committed it to memory. The two adorable and charming princes skilfully recited the holy classic, the Ramayana, which extols virtue, before the sages, the learned brahmins and the ascetics, as they had been instructed to do.", "On a particular occasion, the two princes, great-souled, fortunate, and equipped with all good qualities, chanted the great epic in Shri Rama\u2019s assembly.

Excellent\u201d, and praising the two singers, the virtue-loving sages experienced great joy. Showering praises on the brothers, they cried, \u201cHow melodiously you sing!

None was indigent or dwelt in a mean habitation; all lived happily with their families, possessing wealth, grain, cattle and horses.

Men and women were of righteous conduct, fully self-controlled, and in their pure and chaste behaviour they equalled the great sages. None lacked earrings, coronets and necklaces. They bathed daily and rubbed their bodies with oil, using attar of roses and sandal paste. None ate impure food, none allowed his neighbour to suffer hunger.

How can I then send my son, beautiful as a god, but inexperienced in war, to oppose Ravana? O Sage, I will not let my young child go. Lavana, the son of Madhu is among those who destroy the sacrifice. I will not give up my son. The sons of Sunda and Upasunda, Marica and Suvahu, who resemble death itself in battle, are among those who impede the sacrifice.

Blessed by fortune, filled with patience and endurance, you have cherished great vows and should\u2019st not, therefore, abandon dharma. The three worlds know you as virtuous, it is your duty to maintain integrity and not to act in contradiction to it. O Chief of Men, if one making a promise does not honour it, he loses the merit of his good deeds. It is, therefore, for you to be faithful to your word and let Rama accompany this sage. Though Shri Ramacandra is inexperienced in warfare, yet the asuras will not be able to overcome him. Furthermore, he is under the protection of Shri Vishvamitra and no harm can come to him. How can one steal the nectar that is surrounded by fire? The holy Vish-wamitra is virtue itself, his powers are unsurpassed, and there is none living equal to him in wisdom and asceticism. In the whole world of men and other beings, none excels him in the use of weapons and none has fathomed the depth of his nature. Neither the celestials, nor the sages, nor the asuras, nor any other beings know the full glory of this sage. The god Krishasawa and his highly virtuous sons gave every variety of weapon to Vishvamitra when he was king. The two daughters of Daksha, Jaya and Suprabha invented thousands of resplendent weapons. Shri Vishvamitra is not one, but many in one form; he is illustrious, mighty and able to defeat any in battle. Jaya produced five hundred weapons supremely potent and capable of destroying a host of asuras. Suprabha also created five hundred weapons of war which no foe in the world could withstand. Shri Vishvamitra is an adept in the use of all these arms, O King, he is also able to create many new weapons and there is nothing in the three divisions of time which is not known to him. Do not hesitate to send your son Rama with this mighty and courageous sage, Shri Vishvamitra, and do not entertain any fears for his safety.

O Rama, no one in the three worlds will rival you in good fortune, skill, knowledge and practical wisdom. O Prince, when you have learnt these sciences, you will be able to answer any question and you will be unique in scholarship. These two sciences, O Rama, are the parents of all other sciences. You will be able to control hunger and thirst by their application. O Prince of the House of Raghu, by the mastery of this lore, Bala and Atibala, you will attain renown throughout the whole world. These brilliant sciences are the daughters of Brahma, I shall impart them to you, O Prince, because you are qualified to receive them. O Rama, all the fruits of this knowledge are already your attributes, yet when you have mastered it, you will be able to teach it to others.\u201d", "Shri Ramacandra then poured the water over his body and with a cheerful countenance said to the Sage Vishvamitra:\u2014\u201cO Great Rishi, I am your servant, teach me these sciences.\u201d", "Possessed of the knowledge of these two sciences, the mighty Rama resembled the sun in autumn, emitting a thousand rays.

Who dwells here? We are both eager to hear of this.\u201d", "The great sage smiled and answered Rama, saying: \u201cHear, my son, I will tell you who formerly dwelt here. Kandarpa, whom the pundits called Kama once took human form and fixed in meditation, worshipped the Lord Shiva here. When Shri Shiva was passing with his newly-wedded bride, accompanied by celestial beings, Kama tried to agitate the mind of the Lord Shiva and reaped the due punishment of his insolence. O Son of the House of Raghu, Shiva in wrath opened his third eye and the members of Kama\u2019s body were consumed. Since Kama was reduced to ashes by the God, he has been a disembodied being. O Rama, since that time, he has been known as Ananga (bodiless) and the country where his limbs were strewn as he sought to flee, is known as Anga. This hermitage belongs to the Lord Shiva and the holy men who dwell here are his traditional devotees: they are both righteous and sinless. O Rama, You of pleasing looks, this night I shall break my journey at this hermitage and to-morrow we shall cross the sacred river and proceed further. O Rama, let us first purify ourselves by bathing and then recite the holy Gayatri silently, offering oblations into the sacred fire, we will thereafter pass the night in the hermitage.\u201d", "While Shri Rama and the sage were conversing, the holy ascetics dwelling in the hermitage, knew by the power of their Yoga, that these great beings were approaching and were highly gratified.", "Having presented arghya to Shri Vishvamitra, they then offered hospitality to Shri Ramacandra and Lakshmana.

When the craft was in mid-stream, the roar of the waters was heard by Shri Ramacandra and his younger brother. They questioned the holy sage, saying: \u201cO Venerable Lord, what is the cause of this tumult?\u201d", "In answer to Shri Ramacandra, Shri Vishvamitra described the cause of the sound in the following manner:\u2014", "\u201cO Prince, on Mount Kailasha, Shri Brahma created a lake by the power of his thought, on account of which it is called the Lake of the Mind (Manasarovara). The holy river Sarayu rises in the Manasa Lake and flows through the capital Ayodhya, here it joins the sacred stream Gunga, and this sound is produced when the two rivers unite. With concentrated mind, offer salutations to them.\u201d", "The two royal princes made obeisance to the rivers, and having reached the southern bank, left the boat and proceeded onward. Walking further, the two princes beheld a dark and terrible forest and Shri Ramacandra again addressed the Sage as follows: \u201cO Great Sage, this forest looks dark and sinister; above the ceaseless clamour of crickets and other insects, fearful beasts can be heard roaring. The forest resounds with their dread cries while the harsh and discordant notes of birds echo through it. See, O Sage! Boars, lions, tigers and elephants abound there, it is overgrown with dhara, ashvakama, kujaja, patala, sillea and tinduka trees, it is indeed terrifying.\u201d", "The highly resplendent Sage Vishvamitra hearing these words, said: \u201cMy son, I will tell you something of this dark forest. Formerly there were two cities named Malava and Karusha, they were both prosperous and resembled the cities built by the gods. O Rama, in ancient times, Indra slew the wicked Vritrasura then, being hungry and thirsty, he went to an inauspicious and isolated place where he became distressed on account of the sin of having slain a brahmin. The gods and holy sages bathed Indra in the sacred waters of the Ganges, and purged away his sin by pouring jars of water charged with mantrams over him. In this way, the remorse of Indra was appeased, the pollution caused by slaying a brahmin was washed away and he was highly gratified. Purified and sinless, Indra gladly conferred a boon on this land saying: \u2018These two cities will be known as Malava and Karusha and they will acquire great renown, their prosperity will be famed throughout the earth.\u2019", "\u201cWhen Indra thus favoured these two cities, the celestial beings praised him and cried: \u2018Be it so.\u2019 These two places soon enjoyed great prosperity and fame. In the course of time, a perverse yakshini was born here, possessing the strength of a thousand elephants. Her name was Taraka, the wife of Sunda, and her son was the rakshasa, Marica, who was equal in strength to Indra himself. He possessed long arms, an enormous mouth, and a gigiantic body. This terrible rakshasa continually destroys the people of these two lands.", "\u201cO Rama, the wicked Taraka constantly plunders and devastates these two countries. Obstructing the road, she lives at two miles distance from here; let us enter the forest of Taraka. By my command, O Rama, do you slay the wicked yakshini and set the country free. O Rama, none dares to come hither for fear of Taraka; save this land from the dangerous demoness. This is why this forest is uninhabited, but you can\u2019st restore it. This wicked yakshini is unceasingly bent on her evil designs.\u201d", "[Full title: Vishvamitra seeks to convince Rama that it is his duty to slay Taraka].", "Hearing the words of Shri Vishvamitra, Shri Rama of limitless power and influence uttered the following auspicious words:\u2014", "\u201cO Great Sage, it is said that the yakshinis have little power, then how is it that Taraka has come to possess the strength of a thousand elephants?\u201d", "The mahatma listened to Rama\u2019s words and said: \u201cO Prince, I will relate the story to you. This female demon has acquired her great strength by virtue of a boon which she received. In the past, a powerful yaksha by the name of Suketu, who was virtuous but childless, performed many yogic practices which pleased Shri Brahma, who promised him a daughter by name Taraka, and conferred on her the strength of a thousand elephants. But the most illustrious Brahma did not grant a son to that yaksha. When the daughter grew up and possessed both the charm of youth and great beauty, her father gave her in marriage to Sunda, the son of Jambha. After some time, the yakshini gave birth to a son. His name was Marica and he was very powerful; though born of yaksha parentage he became a rakshasa through a curse. O Rama, when the Sage Agastya condemned Sunda to death by cursing him, then Taraka and her son wished to devour the sage. Seeing her running towards him, the blessed Sage Agastya cursed Marica and said \u2018Become a demon\u2019. He also cursed that wicked woman so that she became a cannibal with a hideous countenance. Shri Agastya said: * May your beauty vanish and mayest you become a terrible rakshasi.\u2019 Then Taraka, transported with anger under this curse, began to destroy this sacred land because it was here that the Sage Agastya performed his yogic practices.", "\u201cO Rama, you must slay this wicked and impious demon Taraka, who ravages the land. For the good of die brahmins and the king, O Raghava, accomplish this; do not hesitate to destroy this vile yakshini. It is the duty of a warrior to protect those of the four castes. A prince must not eschew deeds that are painful and difficult, for the preservation of his people. It is according to the law of eternal dharma, O Rama, that even deeds that appear ruthless, are permitted to those appointed to protect their subjects. O Raghava, Taraka is wholly evil, and therefore must be destroyed. It is said that in the past Manthara, a daughter of King Virocana, was slain by Indra because she was the cause of the destruction of others. The blessed Lord Vishnu Himself slew the wife of the Sage Bhrigu, devoted to her husband, and the mother of Shukra because she was intent on killing Indra. Many other great-souled princes of old also condemned wicked women to death. Therefore, it is for you to fulfil your duty and slay this yakshini without delay.\u201d", "The son of Dasaratha, firm in his vows, listened to the inspiring words of the Sage Vishvamitra, which filled him with ardour, and with joined palms he humbly addressed him:\u2014", "\u201cTo fulfil the commands of my royal sire and to honour his promise, I deem it my duty to act according to your instructions without hesitation. My father, the emperor, at the time of my departure from Ayodhya bade me carry out your injunctions\u2014O Muni, I shall honour them. I am prepared to execute your commands, O Rishi, because it will lead to the benefit of the brahmins and the king, and will also bring happiness to the people of this land.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Shri Rama grasped his bow and, twanging the string, filled all the cardinal points with the sound. The denizens of the forest were terrified, and Taraka was overcome with helpless rage. Full of wrath that yakshini ran in the direction from which the sound came and Shri Ramacandra beholding that gigantic and misshapen monster was incensed and said to Lakshmana: \u201cO Brother, behold this fearful yakshini of formidable size, whose veiy aspect would strike terror into timorous hearts. See, O Lakshmana, how I shall cut off her ears and nose and put her to flight! She is horrible, versed in black magic and hard to subdue, but it is not proper to deprive a woman of her life. A woman is worthy of protection, therefore, I shall incapacitate her, by depriving her of the power of motion thus preventing her from doing further mischief.\u201d", "While Shri Rama was still speaking, the dreadful Taraka ran towards him roaring with uplifted arms. The Rishi Vishvamitra approaching her encouraged Rama, with a shout, crying, \u201cJai to the descendant of Raghu\u201d. Notwithstanding, Taraka raised a thick cloud of dust and for a while Shri Rama and Lakshmana could see nothing. Then the yakshini by the power of magic caused a shower of rocks to rain on the two brothers and Rama was now filled with wrath. Parrying the rain of rocks and advancing towards her, he cut off both her hands. Then Shri Lakshmana severed the nose and ears of the asuri who had already been deprived of her hands. Assuming various forms, she tried to deceive the princes by vanishing away. Then from her hiding place, she showered heavy rocks on them, and a rain of stones fell on every side.", "Shri Vishvamitra, who stood watching the combat, now cried: \u201cEnough, she does not deserve further mercy; should\u2019st you spare her, she will gain strength through her magic powers and will again break up our holy rites. The evening is approaching and in the evening rakshasas are overcome with difficulty; slay her, therefore, without delay.\u201d", "Then Shri Vishvamitra pointed out the concealed yakshini to Rama, who drew from his quiver arrows capable of following sound and surrounded her with them. The powerful female demon, an adept in occult powers, encompassed by the rain of arrows, advanced roaring, towards the princes. With an arrow, Shri Rama pierced the heart of the wicked yakshini, who fell to the ground and expired. Seeing the terrible yakshini slain, Indra and other celestial beings worshipped Shri Rama, crying: \u201cWell done, well done, O Holy Rama!\u201d All the gods filled with joy, said to Shri Vishvamitra: \u201cO Muni, may prosperity attend you, Indra and the gods are gratified with Shri Ramacandra\u2019s feat of arms, show your special favour to him and deliver to him the two kinds of weapons, natural and supernatural, belonging to Krishashva.

AD these weapons did Shri Vishvamitra confer on Rama, and he, repeating the appropriate mantrams, caused their presiding deities to appear before him. Approaching with joined palms, they said: \u201cO Prince of the House of Raghu, we are your servants and wiD obey your behests.\u201d", "Shri Rama, having surveyed and blessed them, answered: \u201cCome and serve me when I summon you.\u201d", "Thereafter, Shri Ramacandra offering salutations to the venerable Sage Vishvamitra, said: \u201cLet us proceed further, my Lord.\u201d", "Having received the weapons and instructions for their use, Shri Rama addressed the sage in charming accents as they proceeded onward.", "He said: \u201cO Blessed One, by your grace, I have received weapons which even the devas and asuras cannot easily obtain.

This spot is called Siddha-ashrama, for here, these great souls practised austerities with success. At that time, Bali the son of King Virocana, conquered Indra and other devas, together with the deities of the wind and he ruled over the three worlds. When Bali initiated a sacrifice, the devas, under the leadership of Agni approached Shri Vishnu in this hermitage and said: \u2018O Lord, the son of Virocana, King Bali is observing a great sacrifice; while it is yet incomplete, come to our aid. The Lord grants the requests of those who seek His favour, therefore, by the power of Your Yoga and for our own good, take the form of a dwarf (Vamana) and secure our welfare.\u2019 Meantime, O Rama, the Sage Kashyapa, resplendent as fire, who was endowed with supreme lustre by virtue of his yogic practices, with his spouse Aditi, having completed a thousand years\u2019 austerities, began to praise Madhusudana, the conferrer of boons, saying: \u2018O Supreme Purusha, You are adored through austerity and You dost grant the fruit of austerity, Your nature is knowledge and asceticism, it is by virtue of austerity that I behold You. O Lord, in Your body I see the whole world animate and inanimate. In You Who art beginningless and indescribable, I take refuge.\u2019", "\u201cThe blessed Vishnu was pleased with this prayer and said to the sinless Sage: \u2018O Kashyapa, mayest you see perfection, you have merited a boon, ask what you desirest.\u2019", "\u201cThen Kashyapa, the son of Marichi, answered: \u2018O Blessed Lord, Aditi, the gods and I beseech You to grant this boon\u2014Become the son of my sinless wife and myself.

This spot, by Your grace, shall then be known as Siddha-Ashrama.\u2019 (Hermitage of the Perfect Ones.)", "\u201cUpon this, the resplendent Vishnu was born of the womb of Aditi as the incarnation Vamana and disguised as a mendicant, he approached King Bali.

Neither gandharvas nor asuras can bend this great bow, how much less man? To test their skill, great kings have come to the assembly of King Janaka, but none has succeeded in raising the bow and stringing it. O Illustrious One, let us go and see the sacrifice of the King of Mithila and also that marvellous bow. In former days, King Janaka performed a sacrifice and the fruit of it was the great bow which he obtained from the gods who instructed him saying: \u2018Place this bow in the sacrificial chamber and let it be worshipped with incense, perfume and lights", "Shri Vishvamitra having related these facts, started out accompanied by the two princes and other sages.

Why are the servants of the king taking me away from your presence, by force?\u201d", "Seeing the sorely stricken Shabala, Shri Vasishtha addressed her as he would his own sister, saying: \u201cO Shabala, it is not by my will that you are thus being carried away, neither hast you offended me in any way, O Dear One. Drunk with desire, the king is taking you from me by force. I have not the power to defend you. The king is a warrior and lord of the earth, he is attended by a mighty army with horses, elephants and chariots, verily he is mightier than I.\u201d", "Shabala, who was skilled in argument, listened to the words of Shri Vasishtha and said: \u201cO Holy Sage, the power of a warrior is as nought compared to that of a holy sage. O Illustrious Lord, the strength of a sage is divine and based on the exercise of spiritual practices and discipline, it is therefore limitless; you are, O Lord, immeasurably stronger than a kshatriya. The power of that mighty king Vishvamitra, is great, but he cannot equal your strength and splendour. O Lord, through your strength and energy suffer me to destroy the power and pride of this wicked wretch.\u201d", "Shri Vasishtha answered: \u201cBe it so! Create an army by your spiritual energy, that will destroy the forces of the king.\u201d", "Lowing loudly, Shabala, in obedience to the sage, instantly produced hundreds of foreign soldiers, who began to destroy the army of Vishvamitra while he was looking on. Perceiving his army about to be overthrown, King Vishvamitra became enraged and, mounting his chariot, his eyes red with anger, he advanced to the attack. With various weapons, he began to slay thousands of men, and Shabala, seeing the army created by her, annihilated, now produced strange beings called shakas in such numbers, that they filled the whole earth. Highly valorous, their skins shining like gold, clad in yellow armour, furnished with scimitars and maces, they started to consume the army of Vishvamitra like a raging fire.", "Then the great Vishvamitra, with the aid of yogic weapons, began to create disorder in the ranks of the forces produced by Shabala.", "As the mighty warriors fell, pierced by the weapons of Vishvamitra\u2019s forces, Shri Vasishtha said to Shabala: \u201cO Shabala, create more warriors by the power of Yoga.\u201d", "Shabala, lowing loudly, produced well-armed soldiers from her feet and udders, and from her hair and thighs were born the extraordinary warriors Harita and Kirata. By these, the whole army of Vishvamitra consisting of elephants, horses and chariots, was instantly destroyed. Beholding their entire army exterminated by the power of Shri Vasishtha, King Vishvami-tra\u2019s hundred sons bearing mighty arms and with various thought-propelled weapons rushed angrily at the holy Sage Vasishtha. Shri Vasishtha merely uttered the sound \u201cH\u2019m!\u201d and they were all immediately consumed. By the great Sage Vasishtha, the infantry, cavalry and chariots, together with the sons of King Vishvamitra, were instantly burned to ashes.", "Then the illustrious monarch Vishvamitra whose sons and army had been annihilated, was filled with shame and dismay. Deprived of his glory, he resembled a waveless ocean or a snake bereft of its fangs or the sun under eclipse. Like a bird without wings, his confidence shattered, his pride humbled, he became filled with anxiety. Bestowing the kingdom on his only remaining son, he exhorted him to rule according to dharma and then himself retired to the forest to practise asceticism.", "After some time, he found favour with Shri Mahadeva the magnanimous granter of boons, and he, appearing before Vishvamitra, addressed him saying: \u201cO King, why art you undergoing penance? What is your desire? I will grant you whatsoever you asks?\u201d", "Shri Vishvamitra making obeisance to Shri Mahadeva said to him: \u201cO Great God, if I have found favour with you, then instruct me in the Upanishads and other branches of learning, teach me also the mysteries and the science of archery. Whatever weapons are known to the danavas, yakshas, asuras and other beings, let them be revealed to me by your grace.\u201d", "On hearing the request of the king, Shri Shiva answered, \u201cBe it so\u201d and returned to his abode.", "King Vishvamitra, having acquired the various weapons from Mahadeva, became as happy as the sea at the time of the full moon. He now resolved to subdue the Sage Vasishtha and regarded him as his captive already.", "Proceeding to his hermitage he discharged his great weapons like rain, setting the forest of Tapovan ablaze. Afflicted by these dreadful weapons, all the sages began to flee to the four quarters in terror; even the disciples of Shri Vasishtha, together with innumerable birds and beasts, escaped hastily in every direction. The hermitage of Shri Vasishtha became deserted and a deep silence fell upon it, causing it to resemble a barren field.", "Shri Vasishtha repeatedly called out: \u201cFear not, fear not, I will destroy Vishvamitra as the sun dispels the morning mist.\u201d", "Then the great Sage Vasishtha, foremost among those who practise silent prayer, angrily addressed Vishvamitra saying: \u201cYou have destroyed my ancient and auspicious hermitage, O Wicked and Deluded Wretch, you thyself shaft be destroyed.\u201d", "Snatching up his staff equal to the rod of Yama, he advanced like a naked flame.", "[Full title: Shri Vasishtha by his spiritual strength conquers Vishvamitra who then engages in penances].", "Hearing the harsh words uttered by Shri Vasishtha, Vishvamitra raising the fire weapon, cried: \u201cStay! Beware!\u201d", "Then Shri Vasishtha, lifting up his Brahma staff in wrath, exclaimed: \u201cO Vilest of Warriors, here I stand, let loose all your weapons, not excepting those propelled by thought which you have obtained from the Lord Shiva. O Son of Gadhi, to-day I will deprive you of all these weapons. How can your power as a warrior compare with that of a divine sage? O Stupid Wretch, behold my divine energy!\u201d", "So saying, Shri Vasishtha quenched the dangerous fire weapon hurled at him by Vishvamitra as water quenches fire.", "Then the son of Gadhi let fly other dangerous weapons upon the holy sage, the Varuna, the Rudra, the Indra, the Pashupata and Ishika weapons together with the Manava, Mohana, Gandharva, Swapana, Jrimbhana, Viadana, Santapana, and Vilapana; the Shoshana, Darana and the terrible Vatra; the Brahmapasha and Kalapasha, the Varunapasha and the priceless Pinaka and also the missiles Shushka and Ardra, the Danda weapon and the Pisacha, the Krouncha and the Dharmadiscus, the Kala discus and the discus of Vishnu, also the weapon Vayuvya, Mathana and Haya-shira did he discharge upon the great sage with the two Shaktis, the Kankala, Mushala, Vidyadhara, Kala, the trident Kapala and the Kankana. All these did he hurl at the holy sage.", "Then Shri Vasishtha accomplished a great marvel and by means of his staff alone destroyed all the weapons of Vishvamitra. Seeing these weapons rendered ineffectual, Vishvamitra raised the Brahman-astra. At this, Agni, the divine sages and the celestial beings were seized with terror and the three worlds shook with fear. But by means of his spiritual power and the study and practice of Brahman-Vidya, Shri Vasishtha subdued the Brahman-astra. As Shri Vasishtha consumed this tremendous weapon, his charming and pleasing mien became terrible and from each pore of his body shafts of light shot forth while the staff of the holy sage, shining like fire, burst into flame.", "All the sages now began to praise Shri Vasishtha, saying: \u201cYour power is without equal and ever productive of good, by the power of your Yoga, pacify the Brahman-astra. O Holy Sage, you have humbled the pride of Vishvamitra. O Great Ascetic, be pacified, that we also may be delivered from fear.\u201d", "Thus addressed, Shri Vasishtha assumed his accustomed mien and Vishvamitra, being defeated, sighing heavily, exclaimed: \u201cWoe, woe to the might of a warrior! The real power is the spiritual power. Shri Vasishtha by his spiritual strength has fully conquered mine. I will, therefore, abandon my warlike nature and seek to obtain brahmanhood.\u201d", "[Full title: Shri Vasishtha refuses to help King Trishanku enter heaven in his physical state].", "The heart of Vishvamitra was heavy, remembering his disgrace, and he was filled with remorse at having borne enmity to Shri Vasishtha.", "O Rama, with his queen he went to the southern quarter and began his great ascetic penance there.", "After a long time four sons were born to him, each a devotee of truth, who were virtuous and of great military prowess. Their names were Havisyanda, Madhusyanda, Drirha-netra and Maharatha.", "Having practised severe austerities for a thousand years, the Grandsire of the world, Shri Brahma appeared before Vishvamitra and said: \u201cO Son of Kaushika, you have surpassed the royal sages in your great asceticism, you shalt, therefore, be numbered among them.\u201d Having thus spoken, Shri Brahma with the gods went to Brahmaloka.", "Vishvamitra was filled with shame and with bowed head, overcome with grief, thus spoke: \u201cAlas! In spite of prolonged austerities, the gods still hold me to be a royal sage. I deem this state no reward for the penance I have undergone.\u201d", "O Rama, with renewed resolve, Vishvamitra, pre-eminent in the field of endeavour began his life of mortification anew.", "At this time, the great King Trishanku of the House of Ikswaku, fully self-subdued and a lover of truth, resolved to initiate a sacrifice in order to enter heaven in his physical body. Summoning the holy Sage Vasishtha, he communicated his intention to him, but the Mahatma Vasishtha, having duly considered the matter, said: \u201cO King, this cannot be.\u201d", "Discouraged by Shri Vasishtha and for the purpose of fulfilling his design, the monarch went southwards to where the sons of Shri Vasishtha abode, leading lives of purity and ascetism. When King Trishanku beheld the sons of his own Guru, that great and illustrious sage, he was full of shame, and with bowed head offered salutation to them, addressing them in great humility saying, \u201cO Protectors of those who seek refuge in you, I come to seek your aid. O Holy Ones, I besought your sire to assist me in the observance of a sacrifice and he discouraged me. I have, therefore, come to seek your help in the matter. O Sons of my Holy Guru, I offer salutations to you. Again and again, I bow down to you, O Holy Ones, and beseech you to officiate at the proposed sacrifice, which I desire to undertake for the fulfilment of my design, namely that I may ascend to heaven in my embodied state. Discouraged by the holy teacher Vasishtha, I consider that you alone are able to assist me. Should you refuse me, there is none in whom I may take refuge. The kings of the House of Ikshvaku have always sought guidance of their spiritual preceptor in time of need, and the holy and learned Sage Vasishtha has ever upheld the dynasty and, following him, you alone are my instructors", "[Full title: The king appeals to Shri Vasishtha\u2019s sons to conduct the sacrifice.

Shall we render void the utterance of our great sire?\u201d", "Hearing these harsh words, the king replied: \u201cDiscouraged by my Guru and now by you, I shall seek elsewhere for aid; may all be well with you.\u201d", "The sons of the great sage were enraged on hearing these words spoken in defiance, and cursed the king, saying: \u201cMayest you become one of the fallen caste.\u201d Having thus cursed him, they returned to their hermitage.", "When the night was over, the king was transformed into a low-born being, his complexion dark, his body emaciated, his head shaven, his whole frame besmeared with ashes from the crematorium, his golden ornaments changed to lead.", "When the people of the capital beheld the king in this condition they fled from that place, and Trishanku departed, full of anguish. Sunk in grief day and night, he finally sought refuge with Shri Vishvamitra. That sage seeing the monarch deprived of his kingdom and condemned to assume the form of a low-caste being, was moved with compassion, and addressed him saying: \u201cO Mighty Prince, mayest you be prosperous! Why hast you come hither?

O Lord, I have failed to obtain the fruit of countless sacrifices, an untruth has never been uttered by me, I have governed my people with righteousness and by my conduct have satisfied my spiritual preceptor and holy men. I desired to undertake a further meritorious sacrifice, but O Great Sage, my Guru has withheld his aid. O Lord, destiny is irrevocable, destiny is inexorable, none can withstand it.

Now let us inaugurate the rites.\u201d", "Then the rites began, as prescribed by ancient tradition, Vishvamitra acting as the chief priest and the learned brahmins becoming the sacrificing priests subordinate to him. Observing numerous rituals, the sacrifice continued for a long time. Then Shri Vishvamitra called thither the gods for their share of the sacrifice, but none of these celestial beings appeared. At this the great sage grew exceedingly wroth and lifting up the sacrificial vessel, said to the King Trishanku: \u201cO King, behold the power of my asceticism by virtue of which I now send you to heaven in your embodied state. O King, though it is deemed impossible to accomplish this, by the power acquired by me I now say to you; \u2018ascend to heaven in your physical form.\u2019\u201d", "Having uttered these words, King Trishanku, in the presence of the sages instantly ascended to the heavens.", "Seeing Trishanku there, Indra and all the other gods exclaimed: \u201cO Trishanku, you have no place in heaven.

At that moment, standing amidst the sages, the great rishi resembled Prajapati. Thereafter he created seven planets in the southern quarter called the Seven Rishis, and then he created the Ashvini and twenty-seven other stars. Seated amidst the sages, filled with wrath, Vishvamitra reflected in himself: \u201cI will create another Indra or I will leave this heaven without an Indra. Nay, I will make Trishanku Lord of this heaven,\u201d and he began to create a new circle of gods.", "Upon this, the sages, gods and celestial beings, bewildered and perturbed, approached Vishvamitra and said with humility: \u201cO Great Sage, this king has been cursed by his spiritual preceptor and is not worthy of heaven.\u201d", "Shri Vishvamitra answered them, saying: \u201cHear, O you Gods, I have vowed that this king should enter heaven in his embodied state, this pledge must be fulfilled.

If you dost not grant him brahmanhood, verily the three worlds will be destroyed. None can find rest anywhere, the seas are drying up and the mountains are riven by the power of his austerities; the sun is deprived of its splendour, the earth is agitated and the wind stirs not. O Lord, we cannot move him from his resolve. On account of this peril, men like atheists have given up the performance of charitable deeds. Nowhere is peace to be found. O Divine Being, lest the mighty Vishvamitra, resplendent as fire, determine to destroy the universe, deign to grant him his desire. As Time, in the form of fire, at the dissolution of the world, consumes the whole universe, so also will the Sage Vishvamitra. Grant him, therefore, Indrahood, if he so desire it, for if You withhold brahmanhood which he has sought to acquire, then only the sovereignty of Indra\u2019s region, will content him.\u201d", "Thus approached, Shri Brahma, accompanied by the gods, appeared before Shri Vishvamitra and in pleasing accents addressed him, saying: \u201cO Brahmarishi, reverence to you, we are pleased with thine austerity.

For the marriage of my daughter, it was established by me and made known to the kings coming to seek her hand, that I should not bestow her on any prince whose strength had not been fully tried. O Renowned Sage, these kings have come to test their prowess and I have placed the bow before them and requested them to string it, but none as yet has been able to do so. Perceiving them to be deficient in strength, I have refused to bestow my daughter on any of them. These kings, inflamed with anger, considering their failure to string the bow had brought them into disrepute, surrounded my capital, and inflicted great hardship on my people. This siege endured a full year and immeasurably reduced my treasury. Undergoing severe penances, I propitiated the gods, who granted me a large army with which I have defeated those kings who have retreated, bereft of courage, yet still smarting under imagined injury.", "\u201cO Great Sage, this is that bow and I will show it to these two princes.

Five hundred men, of great strength, brought the eight-wheeled cart on which the bow was placed.

O Sovereign of Mithila, it is at your disposal.\u201d", "Then, with palms joined in humility, King Janaka spoke to the holy Sage Vishvamitra standing with Rama and Lakshmana: \u201cO Holy Lord, this is the bow which has been the object of worship to the kings of the Nimi dynasty and which the monarchs of the earth coming hither have sought to string. Even the gods have not been able to raise, bend or string this bow. How, therefore, should mortals have the power to do so if the gods have failed? O Great Rishi, behold the bow, let the two princes examine it.\u201d", "The righteous Sage Vishvamitra, hearing the words of the king, said to Rama: \u201cO Child, view this divine bow.\u201d Then Shri Rama, approaching the casket in which the bow lay, opened it and gazed upon it.", "He said: \u201cO Divine Lord, taking it in my hand and raising it up, I shall endeavour to string the bow.\u201d Then the king and the sage answered: \u201cBe it so,\u201d and Shri Ramacandra with a slight effort, seizing the centre of the bow, lifted it up in the presence of thousands of people and without exertion drew it. By the unparalleled strength of the illustrious Rama, the bow broke into two parts and a sound resembling the fall of a thunderbolt rang forth cleaving the mountains asunder and causing the earth to shake, and on this the people on every side fell insensible, save only Vishvamitra, Rama and Lakshmana.", "After a while, the people being somewhat restored, and the king\u2019s misgivings set at rest, he addressed the excellent Sage with humility, saying: \u201cO Blessed Lord, I have witnessed the unparalleled, wonderful and incontestable feat of Shri Ramacandra.

Divine music sounded, nymphs danced and the celestial singers broke into paeons of praise. All these marvellous events marked the wedding of the sons of King Dasaratha while the princes, circumambulating the fire, were united with their brides.", "Thereafter with their wives, they returned to their apartments and King Janaka with his relatives and friends, with a joyful heart having taken part in the festivities, also withdrew.", "The night being past, the great Sage Vishvamitra took leave of King Dasaratha and King Janaka and, blessing the princes and their sire, departed for the Himalayas to meditate there. The holy rishi being gone, King Dasaratha begged the permission of the Lord of Mithila to return to his capital. Bidding farewell to the pious king, Janaka escorted him for some distance on his way.", "To the King of Ayodhya, on behalf of his daughter, King Janaka gave a hundred thousand cows, woollen cloths, countless silken robes and richly decorated elephants, horses and chariots. He also bestowed on him male and female attendants, numberless golden coins with quantities of pearls and coral. All these and many other gifts King Janaka gave with a joyful mind, and having taken leave of King Dasaratha, returned to Mithila, whereupon King Dasaratha with his illustrious sons, preceded by the sages, started on the homeward journey, accompanied by his army.", "As the sages, with Shri Ramacandra, advanced in company with the king, the screeching of strange and terrible birds was heard, while frightened deer fled across their path.", "Perceiving these inauspicious signs, the king addressed Shri Vasishtha, saying: \u201cO Holy Guru, why do the birds cry thus ominously, and the deer traverse our path? What do these omens portend? My mind is filled with anxiety, O Divine Lord.\u201d", "The Maharishi Vasishtha, in gentle tones, replied: \u201cO King, the fearful crying of the birds betokens some great danger, but the crossing of the deer from left to right indicates a speedy end to your fears.\u201d", "While they were yet speaking, the earth began to quake and and giant trees fell down, darkness covered the earth and clouds of dust veiled the sun, nor could the cardinal points be discerned. In the great dust storm that followed, the army was overwhelmed with terror and all became paralysed, save Shri Vasishtha, King Dasaratha and the princes alone.", "When the dust was allayed and the army somewhat recovered, Shri Vasishtha beheld the son of Yamadagni of dreadful aspect. With matted hair, Parasurama, the humbler of the pride of kings and emperors, drew near.", "The appearance of the muni resembling the splendour of Mount Kailasha or the fires of dissolution at the end of the world-period was hardly to be borne by human eyes. With his battle axe on his shoulder, bearing a mighty bow, brilliant as lightning, he appeared like Shiva about to strike down Tripura.", "Beholding Parasurama resembling a blazing fire, the sages reflected among themselves and said: \u201cHis father being slain, has Parasurama come again to destroy the warrior caste?\u201d Was not his anger appeased when he formerly destroyed the whole warrior caste? Has he come again to take his revenge on us?\u201d", "Reflecting thus, they approached Parasurama with traditional offerings, saying: \u201cO Rama, accept this arghya.\u201d", "Shri Parasurama accepting the offering, then addressed Shri Rama.", "\u201cO Rama, O Illustrious Hero, I have heard of your great prowess. I have also been acquainted with your heroic deed, the breaking of the bow at Janakapura, verily a feat exciting wonder and surpassing imagination. Having heard of thine achievement, I, taking this other bow, have come hither. With this terrible bow named Yamadagni, show your strength, O Rama, and placing an arrow in it, discharge it. Should\u2019st you be able to accomplish this, I will engage in honourable combat with you.\u201d", "Hearing these words, King Dasaratha, became dejected and humbly addressed the rishi, saying: \u201cO Holy Parasurama, you are a great brahmin sage, it becomes you not to show anger to warriors; be gracious unto my son, who is still a child. You are born in the family of Bhrigu and hast pledged thyself to Indra to bear arms no more. Having given the dominion of the world to Kashyapa and retired to the Mahendra mountain to practise asceticism, why hast you now come hither to destroy us? O Sage, if Rama is slain, none of us will survive.\u201d", "The great son of Jamadagni, disregarding the entreaty of King Dasaratha, again addressed Rama, saying: \u201cO Rama, these two bows of exquisite design, famed throughout the world, exceedingly powerful, were forged by Vishvakarma. One of them, wielded by Shri Shiva in combat with Tripura, was broken by you. The other, held by me, of inexpressible power, was given to Vishnu by the gods and is known to give victory over the foe; it is equal in moment to that which you have broken.", "\u201cFormerly the gods asked Brahma which of the two excelled the other and Shri Brahma, acquainted with their intention, invoked a quarrel between Vishnu and Mahadeva. They entered into combat one with the other. By the shout raised by Shri Vishnu, Shri Mahadeva was struck motionless and his bow unstrung. Then the gods and rishis came to that place and caused the two gods to be reconciled. Thereafter the gods esteemed the bow of Vishnu to be the more powerful and Shri Shiva surrendered his bow to the King of Mithila, together with all its arrows.", "\u201cThis bow, belonging to Vishnu, was given in ancient times by that god to Richika and he gave it to his son Jamadagni, my father. He having renounced the bearing of weapons, retired to practise austerity, when the rash and foolish monarch Sahasravaku slew him. Hearing of the cruel death of my sire, I successively destroyed the warrior caste, from generation to generation, thus acquiring dominion over the earth. I conferred this great dominion as a gift on the Sage Kashyapa at the completion of a sacrifice, and retired to the Mahendra mountain, cheerfully observing the practice of Yoga. To-day, O Valiant Prince, acquainted with your great achievement, I have come hither to behold you. Receive this bow, bestowed on my ancestors by Shri Vishnu and in the spirit of a warrior, place an arrow on it. If you succeed in drawing the bow, I will challenge you to fight.\u201d", "Hearing these words, Shri Rama having regard for the presence of his sire, answered with restraint, saying: \u201cO Parasurama, your deeds are known to me, as also the avenging of your fathers\u2019 murderers. Methinks you dost deem me lacking in valour, I, a kshatriya, and a descendant of the Solar race. O Rishi, witness my prowess.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Shri Ramacandra, incensed, seized the bow and arrows from the rishi\u2019s hands and stringing it, placed an arrow on it. While drawing the mighty bow, the son of Dasaratha addressed the rishi with defiance, saying: \u201cO Sage, you are a brahmin and as such do I honour you; you are further a kinsman of Shri Vishvamitra, therefore I shall not slay you with this arrow, but by this shaft I will rob you of the power of motion so that you shall no longer be able to travel through space, or I will banish you from those high regions to which you have attained by the practice of penance. Say, what is your desire? This divine arrow of Vishnu, possessing the power of vanquishing the strength and pride of the foe, may not be restored by me to the quiver, till it has accomplished its great purpose.\u201d", "When Rama placed the arrow in the sacred bow, Brahma, with the gods, assembled to behold that glorious deed, followed by the gandharvas, apsaras, yakshas and other beings. Shri Ramacandra, having taken up the mighty bow, the three worlds began to tremble and Parasurama, bereft of his divine power, stood aghast. Deprived of his glory and powerless, Shri Parasurama with humble entreaty, addressed the lotus-eyed Rama:\u2014", "\u201cWhen the dominion of the earth was given by me to the sage Kashyapa, he said \u2018You must not inhabit this kingdom Therefore, O Rama, in obedience to the sage, I do not stay on the earth by night. This world is no longer mine, but belongs to Kashyapa. O Rama, do not deprive me of the power of movement, but allow me speedily to return to the beautiful Mahendra mountain. You can\u2019st deprive me of the merits earned by the practice of Yoga. I know You to be the Imperishable, You are verily Vishnu Himself, none but You could\u2019st wield this bow. O Son of Raghu, the gods have assembled to behold You; You are pre-eminent in combat, and the conqueror of Thine enemies. O Virtuous Prince, to be defeated by You is no ignominy; discharge Your matchless arrow and I will return to the Mahendra mountain.\u201d", "Thereupon Shri Ramacandra discharged the arrow and the merit of Parasurama was rendered void, whereupon he speedily departed to the Mahendra mountain.", "The darkness being dispelled and the whole world once more filled with light, Rama was worshipped by the gods and rishis, and Shri Parasurama having circumambulated the son of Dasaratha, returned to his own hermitage.", "[Full title: King Dasaratha with his army, the princes and their brides, return to Ayodhya].", "Shri Parasurama having departed, Shri Rama delivered the bow and arrows as a trust to the god Varuna.

To-day, the astrologers announce that Purnavasu is in the ascendant, but to-morrow it will be the Pushya star, auspicious to your coronation. I desire you, therefore, to be proclaimed regent to-morrow. Do you, from now on, fast with your spouse, passing the night on a bed of kusha grass, with a stone for your pillow. It is the duty of the friends surrounding you to guard you. In such undertakings many obstructions arise.", "\u201cPrince Bharata is in the city of his grandsire, it is my will that you be installed in his absence. Your brother, Bharata, is virtuous, compassionate, master of his senses and obedient to you, yet, O Prince, I know the mind of man to be fickle, even the mind of a righteous and devout man may be subject to inconstancy. To-morrow, your coronation shall take place, therefore, now return to your abode.\u201d", "King Dasaratha having thus spoken, Shri Rama left for his palace. Entering his own abode, anxious to acquaint Janaki with the king\u2019s proposal and not finding the princess in her own apartment, Rama repaired to the palace of his mother. There he beheld the Queen Kaushalya, seated in the temple, observing the vow of silence and praying for her son\u2019s welfare. Acquainted with the sovereign\u2019s decree, Shri Lakshmana and Sumitra were already in the palace of the chief queen, and Sita also having been summoned thither was sitting at her side.", "Queen Kaushalya attended by Queen Sumitra, Lakshmana and Sita, having heard that Shri Rama would be installed when the Pushya star was in the ascendant, was meditating on Narayana, with closed eyes and controlled breathing.", "Shri Rama, approaching his mother, paid reverence to her and joyfully exclaimed: \u201cO Mother, my father has commanded me to serve the people and to-morrow I am to take up the burden of government. Shri Vasishtha, my preceptor, and other sages have ordained that the Princess Sita should, this night, fast with me. At dawn, the Princess Sita and I will carry out those prayers and rites proper to the occasion.\u201d", "Queen Kaushalya, long desirous of this event, with tears of joy flowing from her eyes, answered: \u201cO My Beloved Son Rama, mayest you live long and may all thine enemies perish. Acquiring the throne, mayest you bring joy to your friends, relatives and also Queen Sumitra. O Child, surely you were born under an auspicious star since you have won favour with your royal sire by thine excellent attributes. The purpose of my devotion and austerity, undertaken to please the lotus-eyed Narayana, has been fulfilled to-day inasmuch as you are about to obtain the kingdom of the dynasty of Raghu.\u201d", "Shri Rama listening to his mother\u2019s words, smilingly addressed Shri Lakshmana, he who ever paid honour to his father, and said: \u201cO Lakshmana, share with me the government of the kingdom, you are my second self, the dominion is equally thine. O Brother, I desire life and a kingdom for your sake.\u201d", "Thereafter, Shri Rama, bowing to the two queens, with their permission withdrew with Sita to his own apartment.", "King Dasaratha, having acquainted his son Rama with the knowledge of his approaching regency, now called his spiritual preceptor, Shri Vasishtha, and addressed him, saying: \u201cO Sage, whose only wealth is austerity, graciously approach Shri Rama and cause him to observe a fast with Princess Sita in preparation for his coronation.\u201d", "Shri Vasishtha answering, \u201cBe it so\u201d, went himself to Shri Rama\u2019s palace. Ascending a chariot drawn by two horses, he drove to the palace, and entering by the three gates, approached the abode of Raghava, white as a cloud.", "Shri Rama hearing of the arrival of his preceptor, speedily went forth to welcome him and offer him due obeisance. Taking him by the hand, he assisted him to alight from the chariot and, studying his mood, made enquiries as to his well-being.", "The venerable Vasishtha said: \u201cO Rama, your royal parent is gracious to you, to-morrow you shalt be proclaimed ruler of the kingdom, do you observe a fast to-day. To-morrow, King Dasaratha will install you as regent, as Nahusha of old made over his kingdom to Yayati.\u201d", "Having uttered these words, the knower of truth, the sovereign of munis, requested Rama and Sita to observe a fast that night.", "Then Shri Ramacandra respectfully saluted Shri Vasishtha, and the royal preceptor accepting his salutation departed for his abode.", "Conversing delightfully with his friends, Shri Rama, when requested by them, retired to the inner apartments. The palace of Raghava was crowded with joyful men and women, and resembled a lake filled with lotuses visited by innumerable birds.", "Leaving the palace, Shri Vasishtha perceived the streets to be filled with people. All the roads entering Ayodhya were so crowded with spectators eager to witness Shri Rama\u2019s coronation that none could pass to and fro without difficulty. The sound of the multitudes shouting with joy, filling the highways, resembled the roaring of the sea.", "All the streets of the capital were swept and sprinkled with water; on either side, flower garlands were hanging, and every house was decorated with flags and banners. Men and women, children and the aged, all anxiously awaiting the dawn, so that they might witness the sacred ceremony, looked forward with eagerness to the great festival that would promote their happiness.", "The priest Shri Vasishtha, avoiding the crowded streets, at length reached the royal palace. Ascending the balcony which resembled a white cloud, he greeted the king as Brihaspati pays homage to Indra.", "Seeing the sage approaching, the king rose and enquired as to what Shri Rama had said. Shri Vasishtha answered, \u201cAll is prepared\u201d. As the king rose from his throne, the whole assembly stood up to honour the venerable sage.", "Having heard his spiritual preceptor\u2019s report, the king, dismissing the court, withdrew to the inner apartment, as a lion enters its cave. Entering those gorgeous and richly ornamented apartments equal to one of Indra\u2019s palaces, he resembled the moon gliding through the heavens.", "Shri Vasishtha having taken his departure, Shri Ramacandra and the large-eyed Sita purified themselves, and mentally adored the Lord Narayana. Offering salutations to the vessel containing the sacrificial oblation and to propitiate Narayana, Shri Rama poured clarified butter into the sacred fire. Thereafter partaking of the remainder of the offering and praying for what was auspicious, seated on the kusha grass, he meditated on Shri Narayana. Observing silence with purified minds, the prince and princess slept in the temple. Three hours before the dawn, they rose and caused their servants to clean and decorate the palace. Then, after listening to the recitation of the dynastic ballads causing them great delight, they performed their morning devotions and silently repeated the Gayatri. As the sun rose, clad in silken garments, they saluted Shri Narayana abiding in the golden orb and then instructed the learned brahmins to recite the Peace Chant and other prayers.", "The deep and melodious sound of the Peace Chant, recited by the brahmins, mingling with the beat of drums, filled the capital of Ayodhya. The inhabitants of the city, knowing that Rama and Sita were observing a fast and offering devotion to the Lord, were filled with joy.", "On the dawning of day, the citizens brought banyan trees, setting them up as pillars to adorn the city for the coming coronation. The high temples resembling the Himalayan peaks, the stately houses, the highways, the crescents and streets, the shops filled with merchandise, the mansions where members of the royal family dwelt, the public assembly halls and the tall trees were all hung with flags of different colours which fluttered in the breeze. Here and there, companies of actors and dancers gave pleasure to the people by singing sweetly and playing melodiously on their instruments. In the market, in the houses, at home and abroad, all spoke only of the coming proclamation of Shri Rama as ruler. Children playing in front of their homes also chattered about this matter.", "In honour of the occasion, the roads were strewn with flowers, and rendered fragrant with incense and pleasant odours; lamps were placed here and there lest the royal procession should pass through at night.", "Having decorated the city, the inhabitants awaiting the proclamation, came together in public assemblies or stood on raised tribunes. Praising King Dasaratha, they said: \u201cThat mighty King Dasaratha of the dynasty of Ikswaku is indeed a pious man. Realising he has grown old, he, himself, is installing Rama as ruler. How gracious is our king that he is placing us under the rule of Shri Ramacandra. May the Lord long protect the prince as our ruler. Shri Rama is simple, highly learned, devoted to righteousness and affectionate to his brothers. Virtuous and wise, Shri Rama loves us as his own brethren. May the righteous and sinless King Dasaratha live long, by whose grace, we see Rama enthroned to-day.\u201d", "Hearing the praises of King Dasaratha by the people, those living far distant were attracted to the holy ceremony and flocked to see the royal procession, filling the city of Ayodha Puri.", "On the day of the full moon, the tumult of the multitude was like the roar of the ocean. People coming from far and near to Ayodhya which resembled the city of Amaravati, enhanced the beauty of the capital as aquatic creatures add to the beauty of the sea.", "[Full title: The hunchback maid, Manthara, informs Queen Kaikeyi of Shri Rama\u2019s coming installation].", "At this time, Queen Kaikeyi had a female servant who had accompanied her from the abode of her royal parent and was ever in attendance on the queen. Her name was Manthara.", "By chance, ascending the balcony of the palace which resembled the full moon, she perceived ihe capital of Ayodhya adorned with garlands of lotuses and the principal streets sprinkled with water. Flags were fluttering from the tops of the tall houses, the roads levelled, and the wide streets crowded with people. Holy brahmins carrying auspicious gifts were waiting to offer them to Shri Ramacandra; the temples were painted white and strains of musical instruments resounded everywhere. Elated by the festivities, joyful crowds were singing the Vedic mantras and not only men but elephants, horses and cattle demonstrated their joy in their own peculiar fashion. Large flags bound with flowers were being carried by joyous citizens wandering here and there.", "Manthara was amazed to see these unusual activities and, meeting Shri Rama\u2019s royal nurse gaily dressed in a white silken robe, she enquired of her, saying: \u201cWhy is the wealthy Queen Kaushalya, mother of Shri Rama, distributing immense riches in charity to-day? Why are the people of the capital so joyous? What is the happy king about to accomplish?\u201d", "The royal nurse, overcome with joy at that time, told the hunchbacked Manthara of Rama\u2019s enthronement. She said: \u201cTo-morrow, at dawn, under the Pushya star, King Dasaratha will install the sinless Rama, the subduer of anger, as Yuvaraja.\u201d The words of the nurse filled the hunchbacked woman with jealous wrath. Speedily descending from the high palace which resembled Mt. Kailasa, that sinful woman, consumed with malice, entered the bedchamber of Queen Kaikeyi and, waking her, thus addressed her:\u2014", "\u201cWhy art you sleeping, O Deluded One? You are in imminent peril; art you blind to future suffering? O Fair One, the good fortune which you vauntest is about to pass away, like a river that is dried up in the summer season.\u201d", "Queen Kaikeyi, pained by the bitter words of the sinful hunchbacked maid, answered her saying: \u201cO Manthara, is all well? Why do I behold you with a gloomy mien, what is the cause of your distress?\u201d", "Hearing the gentle accents of Queen Kaikeyi, Manthara, who was full of cunning, assuming a sorrowful mien and feigning friendship for the queen, spoke bitterly, \u201cO Devi, a great calamity has befallen you. Hear me 1 King Dasaratha is about to proclaim Shri Ramacandra as regent. I am immersed in the bottomless sea of fear; I am afflicted with pain and sorrow; I am as if scorched by fire, and for your good I have come hither. O Kaikeyi, your woes are my woes, your sorrows my sorrows, of this I am certain. Hearken! You are the daughter of a great royal House and you are the favourite of King Dasaratha. Why art you deceived by his crafty ways? Outwardly, your husband appears to be a speaker of truth, but, inwardly, he is a deceitful man. His speech is fair, but his heart is hard. Your honesty is the cause of your suffering. Prevailing on you.by specious words, the king visits you and speaks insincere words to you. By delivering the kingdom to Kaushalya\u2019s son, he seeks to make her mistress of all. Like an affectionate mother, you have nourished in your lap the enemy that is called your lord. You resemblest the one who pressed a serpent to her bosom deeming it, through illusion, to be her infant. As a snake or an enemy harms the one who has spared him, so has King Dasaratha to-day dealt with you and your son. This sinful, deceitful monarch will destroy you, your son and your relatives, who are worthy of happiness, by enthroning Shri Ramacandra. O You of Deluded Intellect, ever indifferent to thine own good, hear me, there is yet time. Whatever you can\u2019st do for thine own advantage perform and thus protect your son and me.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Manthara, the beautiful queen rose from her couch, like the autumnal moon. Filled with wonder and delight, she took from her person a precious ornament and presented it to the hunchback woman.", "That lovely one, unequalled in beauty among youthful women, said to Manthara: \u201cO Manthara, you have brought me joyful tidings. Tell me, what I can offer you in return for these pleasing words? I find no difference between Rama and Bharata. I am, therefore, fully satisfied if the king installs Shri Ramacandra. O Dear One, nothing is more pleasing to me than the news of Shri Rama\u2019s enthronement. Ask for whatever pleases you, and I will confer it on you.\u201d", "[Full title: Manthara persuades the queen that Bharata should be regent and Prince Rama banished].", "Prompted by disappointment and anger, Manthara, casting the jewel away, in disdain, cried: \u201cO Foolish Queen, this is no occasion for rejoicing, dost you know that you are about to be submerged in a sea of sorrow? I cannot but laugh silently at your folly. You rejoicest when there is reason to mourn! I pity your simplicity, how should a woman rejoice in the advancement of the son of her enemy? Prince Bharata has an equal right to the kingdom with Ramacandra. Rama fears Prince Bharata and, fearing him, seeks to displace him. Lakshmana, though heir to the throne, is Rama\u2019s obedient servant, just as Prince Shatrughna is faithful to Bharata. O Beautiful One, by birth Bharata has a claim to the throne. Traditionally, the kingdom should be his. Shri Rama is well-versed in affairs of state, and acts promptly in his own interests. Knowing the danger threatening Bharata from Rama, I am filled with dread.", "\u201cTo-day, Queen Kaushalya is fortunate indeed; her son will be enthroned by the holy brahmins at dawn, when the Pushya star is in the ascendant. Thereafter, you shalt have to stand in complete submission like a stone, before Queen Kaushalya whose enemies will be subdued. Thus, not only you, but the virtuous Prince Bharata will become a servant and dependent on the Queen Kaushalya. The women of Shri Rama\u2019s household will be filled with joy, but your daughters-in-law, having no status, will suffer great anxiety and sorrow.\u201d", "Queen Kaikeyi believing Manthara really to be benevolently disposed to her, began to extol the great virtues of Ramacandra, saying: \u201cShri Rama instructed by his holy Guru is truly righteous, grateful, truthful and pious; he, the eldest son of the king, assuredly deserves to be made regent. May he live long! He will ever protect his brothers and servants as a father protects his children. O Kubija, why art you jealous of Rama\u2019s coronation? After a hundred years, Bharata will inherit the throne of his illustrious ancestors. Why art you sad on such a joyful occasion, O Manthara? Shri Ramacandra is as dear to me as is Bharata, he serves me with greater zeal even than he does Queen Kaushalya. If Shri Rama ascends the throne, it is as if Bharata ruled the land; Shri Rama regards his brother as himself.\u201d", "Hearing the Queen\u2019s words, Manthara intensely provoked, sighed deeply and said: \u201cO Stupid One, you deemest adversity to be prosperity, you are sinking in an ocean of suffering and yet dost not perceive it. When Rama becomes king, who will succeed him, Prince Bharata or his own son? Prince Bharata will remain without a kingdom forever.", "\u201cO Beautiful Princess, all the sons of the king cannot occupy the throne, and if they could, it would bring calamity. Therefore, O Kaikeyi, the sovereign confers his throne on the eldest son; yet, if the younger son be endowed with good qualities he may succeed; the kingdom is given to one and one only. When Rama becomes king, then your son like an orphan, deprived of all comfort, will be cast forth from the royal dynasty to suffer. I have come to tell you this for your good and you dost not comprehend it. If you were wise, you wouldst not reward me with this jewel on account of the increased prosperity of your rival. Assuredly when Rama assumes the regency, he will either banish Prince Bharata or have him put to death. Through proximity people acquire affection even for inanimate objects, but you didst send your son in his childhood to your father\u2019s house.", "\u201cPrince Shatrughna has accompanied Bharata; Lakshmana follows Rama as Shatrughna follows Bharata. It is said that a tree marked down for felling by the dwellers of the forest is preserved by the proximity of the thorny ishika bushes. Thus will Lakshmana ever protect Rama, and Rama in return will preserve Lakshmana. These two brothers love each other as do the Asvins; this is well known. Rama will, therefore, seek to harm Bharata though he will ever protect Lakshmana. I, therefore, consider it were best for Bharata to escape to the forest. If Rama succeed to his father\u2019s kingdom, how may your welfare and that of your relatives be assured? To you Bharata is a child worthy of happiness but to Rama he is a rival. When Rama is king, Bharata will not live long. It becomes you, therefore, O Queen, to protect Prince Bharata, as the leader of a herd of elephants protects it from the lion\u2019s spring. Prompted by pride, you have in the past slighted Queen Kaushalya; dost you think she will spare you when she is chief queen? O Beautiful One, note well when Rama obtains the kingdom together with its mountains, seas and valleys, then you and your son, Prince Bharata, will suffer ignominy. Assuredly, when Rama is king, Prince Bharata will be deprived of life, therefore, act so that Rama may be exiled to the forest and Bharata obtain the kingdom.\u201d", "The face of Queen Kaikeyi flushed with anger, and sighing deeply, she said to Manthara: \u201cTo-day, I shall indeed banish Rama and ensure that Bharata be proclaimed regent. O Manthara, how may Bharata become regent, and Rama be deprived of the kingdom?\u201d", "Hearing these words, the sinful Manthara, bent upon the complete destruction of Shri Rama, said to the queen: \u201cHear, O Kaikeyi, I will unfold to you the only course which will lead to the coronation of Prince Bharata. O Kaikeyi, hast you forgotten that which you have often related to me? O Lover of Poesy, if it be your desire to hear the tale from my lips, listen and then take action.\u201d", "Thus addressed, Queen Kaikeyi, rising from her couch, replied: \u201cO Manthara, relate by what means Bharata may acquire the throne and Shri Rama suffer eclipse.\u201d", "Then the wicked Manthara, desirous of doing injury to Rama, said: \u201cFormerly when your husband was engaged in a war between the devas and asuras, he supported the cause of Indra. He took you with him and I accompanied you. O Kaikeyi, to the south, in the Dandaka forest, there ruled a king named Timidvaja in his capital Bijayanta. He was versed in the magic named Shambara, and he was unconquerable by the gods. He waged war on Indra and in the great conflict the asuras, at night, carried off the wounded from their beds and slew them. King Dasaratha fought great battles with these asuras who pierced his body many times with their weapons. He, falling unconscious, you, O Devi, brought him from the battlefield and when they still assailed him, didst skilfully preserve him. O Beautiful One, then the king, your lord, well pleased with you, proffered you two boons, and you didst answer: \u2018I shall claim them when the need arises.\u2019", "\u201cI was not then acquainted with this matter, but you didst later relate it to me. Prompted by my love for you, I have treasured all this in my memory. Now, demand the cessation of preparations for Shri Rama\u2019s enthronement. For the first boon ask for the proclamation of Bharata as regent, and for the second the banishment of Rama for fourteen years. During the period of his exile, men will grow to love your son and his rule will be assured.", "\u201cO, Daughter of a Mighty King, entering the chamber of wrath, clad in soiled raiment, cast thyself on the bare ground. On the entrance of the king, neither look at nor speak to him but, rolling on the ground, continue to weep. Doubtless you are very dear to your lord who, for your sake, would enter a raging fire. The king would never provoke you nor can he bear to see you weep. He would sacrifice life itself for your sake. The king cannot be indifferent to your requests. O Indolent One, test the power of your beauty to-day; but have a care lest the king offer you diamonds, pearls, gold and other gems, and be not caught in the snare of greed.", "\u201cO Fortunate One, remind the king of the two boons promised to you on the battlefield; strive hard for the success of thine undertaking. If the king would lift you up, let him on oath renew his promise. Do you say to him: \u2018O Great King, send Rama into exile for fourteen years and make Bharata ruler of the kingdom.\u2019", "\u201cWhilst Rama is absent, the rule of Bharata will be established and he will reign forever. O Beautiful One, demand the exile of Rama, from King Dasaratha, and all will be well with your son. Men will forget their love for Rama and will cease to care for him, and Bharata will have no enemy anywhere. When Shri Rama returns, the supremacy of Bharata will be firmly established; ruling with love, he will inspire affection and many friends will support him. Therefore, O Queen, questioned by the king, fearlessly and firmly demand that the preparations for Rama\u2019s enthronement be terminated.\u201d", "Kaikeyi, thus prevailed upon to execute the evil design of Manthara and fully prepared to comply with it, followed her counsel as a young chicken follows its mother. The beautiful queen, aggrieved that the king had not consulted her concerning this great event, said: \u201cO Manthara, you are truly my sincere well-wisher! Of all deformed creatures on earth, you are the wisest. O Kubija, as yet, I fail to comprehend the king\u2019s real intention. Deformed women are usually sinful and perverse, but you, O Kubija, art unique, resembling a lotus bending to the breeze. In spite of your physical defect, you are not to be despised. It would seem that your slender waist, bashful of your full rounded bosom, had withdrawn itself. O Manthara, your face is like the full moon, you are indeed lovely, your body is smooth, your waist decorated with a girdle, your thighs are long, your limbs slender. O Manthara, when you walkest before me, clad in a silken sari, reaching to your ankles, you are as graceful as a swan.", "\u201cAcquainted with every grace and blandishment, your hump protruding like the hub of a wheel is surely filled with wisdom, diplomacy and understanding. I, therefore, present you with' a gold chain to adorn it.", "\u201cO Lovely Woman, when Bharata becomes king and Rama goes into exile, I will cover your hump with beaten gold. When I am certain of the success of my undertaking, I will apply sandalwood paste to your hump, and to your forehead a diadem of gold and gems.", "\u201cO Kubija, I will give you ornaments of pure gold; thus attired and adorned you shalt be free to live as you pleases. You shalt put my sister queens to shame and precede them with pride. O You whose face is incomparably beautiful, you are a rival of the full moon. O Deformed One, many hunchbacked women wearing golden ornaments shall attend you as your handmaids.\u201d", "Thus flattered, Manthara reclining on a white couch, glowing like an altar flame, spoke: \u201cO Fortunate One, it is useless to construct a dam when the water has run away, therefore, enter on thine undertaking immediately. Go wait upon the king in the chamber of wrath.\u201d", "Thus prompted by Kubija, the beautiful-eyed Queen Kaikeyi, filled with ambition, entered the chamber of wrath with Manthara. There, inspired by the hunchbacked woman, casting her pearl necklace of immeasurable value on the ground, the queen rolling on the floor, addressed her: \u201cO Kubija, either Rama shall go into exile and Bharata obtain the kingdom, or King Dasaratha will have news of my death. I shall neither put on ornaments, nor partake of delicious dishes; if Rama is installed, it shall be the end of my life.\u201d", "Manthara continued to instruct Kaikeyi in the most cruel manner, uttering words hostile to Rama. \u201cKnow well, O Fortunate One, should Rama become ruler, it will mean endless suffering for you and your son. Therefore exert thyself to overthrow him.\u201d", "The queen, wounded by the shafts of Manthara\u2019s words, placing both hands on her heart, replied angrily: \u201cO Kubija, either you shalt bear the news of my death to the king, or Rama shall be exiled and Bharata enthroned. If Rama be not exiled, then I shall neither sleep on a bed nor wear flowing garments, nor apply sandalwood paste nor antimony to my person. Except Bharata be enthroned, I shall neither eat nor drink. If this is not accomplished, I do not desire to live.\u201d", "Having firmly resolved this, casting her ornaments to the ground, she, herself, lay down like a fallen kinnari.1 Her face veiled in wrath, her body stripped of its garlands and jewels, the queen resembled the sky bereft of sun and stars.", "[Full title: The king is deeply afflicted at the sight of the weeping queen].", "Incited by Manthara, Kaikeyi, like a kinnari, continued to roll on the ground as if wounded by a poisoned arrow. The artful queen, devising a plan, gradually unfolded her design to Manthara. Heaving deep sighs, like a python, Manthara was filled with satisfaction, perceiving her favourite, Kaikeyi, resolved on her evil course of action.", "Reflecting on the matter, torn with jealousy, the queen, plucking out her eyebrows, scattered her shining ornaments on the ground adorning it as stars illumine the firmament. Lying thus, attired in soiled raiment with her hair dishevelled, she resembled a nymph fallen from heaven.", "The king, having given his instructions for the installation of Shri Rama, dismissed the court and entered the inner apartments of the queens to inform them of the great occasion.", "Anxious to impart the good tidings to his beloved consorts, the illustrious King Dasaratha entered the inner apartment, first going to the beautiful abode of Kaikeyi. As the moon sails into a clear sky after eclipse, so did the king enter the apartment of Queen Kaikeyi. He passed through the garden made beautiful by parrots, peacocks, swans and cranes. Music was softly playing, while dwarfed and hunchbacked maids passed to and fro. There were leafy bowers and alcoves on whose walls were painted beautiful pictures. Everywhere champaka and asoka enhanced the view, whilst other trees were laden with blossom and fruit. Altars of ivory, silver and gold with springs of water flowing by seats inlaid with precious metals and costly jewels, where delicious food and drink was constantly served, transformed the palace into paradise itself.", "The king entered the inner apartments, but did not perceive the queen on the couch where desire had caused him to seek her. Calling loudly and receiving no answer, he grew sad; never before had Kaikeyi missed the time of dalliance, never before had the king found the apartment deserted. The monarch desiring to know where the queen was, questioned a maidservant, who replied with fear and submission: \u201cO Sire, she has entered the chamber of wrath.\u201d", "On hearing these words, the heart of the sovereign was exceedingly troubled. Restless and agitated in mind, the king bowed with sorrow entered the chamber of wrath and found the queen lying on the ground in an unseemly manner. The king who, in his old age, loved the young queen as dearly as his own life, was deeply afflicted at the sight. That sinless monarch beheld the ambitious Kaikeyi lying on the earth like a branch tom from a tree, or a nymph thrust forth from heaven. She lay like an apsara fallen on the earth when her merit is exhausted, or like a snapped garland, or a doe ensnared by the hunter, or like a young elephant wounded by a poisonous arrow.", "Standing over her like an immense tusker, the monarch regarded her with affection. Gently caressing her, apprehensive yet propelled by desire, the king addressed his lotus-eyed queen: \u201cO Devi, I know not why you are displeased, by whom hast you been insulted. O tell me! O Auspicious One, I am grieved to see you lying in the dust, why art you, ever benevolent towards me, lying on the earth? You are as dear to me as my own life, why dost you act as one possessed by an evil spirit? Art you sick? If so, I have many eminent physicians who can cure your malady, who being satisfied with the gifts and honours bestowed on them, are ready to obey my will. In an instant they shall restore you to health. O Beautiful One, tell me the symptoms of your complaint. Or dost you desire to reward or punish any man? Do not let the charm of your face be marred by grief.", "\u201cIn order to please you, I will put to death one who does not deserve the penalty, or will pardon one who merits death. I will reduce a rich man to poverty, or cause a pauper to be made wealthy. I and all those who belong to me are your obedient servants. I shall never oppose your will, O Queen. If I can please you even at the cost of my life, you have but to speak. Well dost you know how much I love you, now tell me what I may do for you.", "\u201cI swear to accomplish whatever you desires. Know me to be monarch of a kingdom on which the sun never sets. The lands of Drivira, Sindhu, Sauvira, Sourashtra, Dakshinaputha, Vanga, Anga, Maghandha, Matsha, Kashi and Koshala together with their abundant produce and wealth are ruled by me. If you desirest any of these, tell me.", "\u201cO Frail One, why dost you cause thyself suffering? Rise, rise, O Dearest, what dost you fear? O Kaikeyi, as the sun dispels the mist, I will dispel your fears.\u201d", "Thus flattered by the king, Kaikeyi appeared somewhat pacified, yet in order to afflict her lord, began to utter bitter and harsh words.", "The queen addressed the great sovereign, Dasaratha, who, overcome with desire, was pierced by the shafts of Kamadeva, and said: Neither am I sick nor has any offered me insult. I harbour a certain ambition which you can\u2019st fulfil. If you are willing to accomplish this, then give me your solemn promise and I will make known its purport to you.\u201d", "The resplendent monarch, agitated by desire, raising the head of the queen from the ground took her in his arms and answered smilingly: \u201cO Fortunate One, dost you not know that none is dearer to me than you, saving that lion among men, Shri Ramacandra. I swear by the invincible Rama, who is even dearer to me than you, that I will fulfil your ambition. O Kaikeyi, I swear by Rama, without seeing whom I cannot live one hour, that I will execute your desire. O Dear One, by my oath I have demonstrated to you the intensity of my love, now tell me what you desirest. Knowing the great love I bear for you, have no fear; by my meritorious deeds I declare to you, I will grant you what you asks.\u201d", "Following the instructions of Manthara, knowing the fulfilment of her ambition to be at hand and concerned with the advancement of Bharata, Kaikeyi spoke harshly. Satisfied with the attitude of the king, she, resembling the dreadful god of death, addressed him: \u201cO Great King, formerly you didst promise me two boons to which the thirty-three gods were witness. O King, moon, sun, ether, the planets, day and night, the cardinal points, the universe and those who inhabit it, the earth, the gandharvas, the asuras, the spirits and other beings are witness to that promise given to me by you. O You Gods, listen with attention to the boons which the king, a lover of truth, highly resplendent and acquainted with the law of duty, grants me.\u201d", "The Queen Kaikeyi, praising the king, who was overcome by desire and ready to grant any boon, said: \u201cO King, recollect how in the war between the gods and asuras, you didst fall wounded like one dead, and I rescued you by applying the appropriate means? On your recovery, you didst promise me two boons. O Truthful Monarch, I now earnestly desire these two boons which are in your power to grant. Should you, despite your promises given, not fulfil these desires, then I will relinquish my life, dishonoured by you.\u201d", "The queen, holding the king\u2019s mind subject by her sweet words, resembled a hunter who, intending to slay a deer, lays a snare for it. Then addressing the king infatuated with passion and willing to grant any boon, she said:\u2014", "\u201cO Deva, hear me, I now claim these two boons. Employing the preparations made for Rama\u2019s installation, let my son Bharata be proclaimed regent, this is the first boon. The second pledge granted me on the battlefield is now also due to be fulfilled. Let Ramacandra be exiled to the forest for fourteen years, wearing a dress of bark, with matted locks like a hermit, while my son, Prince Bharata, rules without hindrance. This is my earnest desire. Let me, this day, behold the exile of Rama. O King, Protector of Truth, preserve your integrity and the traditions of your birth. The rishis declare that the observance of truth is the most excellent means of attaining heaven.\u201d", "[Full title: King Dasaratha suffers bitterly at the thought of sending Prince Rama into exile].", "The harsh words of Queen Kaikeyi caused intense suffering and agitation to the heart of the king. He began to reflect\u2014\u201cAm I seeing a dream by day, is my mind unhinged, am I possessed by an evil spirit, is an inauspicious star causing me distress or is this disturbance the result of some malady?\u201d", "Pondering awhile, the king grew calm, but his mind was still troubled, and, recollecting the demands of Queen Kaikeyi, he again became restless and agitated like a deer in the presence of a lioness. Heaving deep sighs, seated on the ground, he resembled a highly venomous snake hypnotized by the power of a mantram. He cried out in anger, \u201cWoe unto me\u201d and fell senseless.", "After a long time, he recovered consciousness, and suffering great distress, full of wrath, answered Kaikeyi, while his glance seemed as if it would consume her. \u201cO You of Evil Disposition, O Destroyer of my Dynasty, what harm have Shri Ramacandra or I done to you? Rama has ever treated you as his own mother. Why hast you determined thus? Alas! I brought you to my house for the destruction of my home. I deemed you to be the daughter of a king and you have shown thyself to be a venomous serpent. All my people unite in praise of Rama. For what fault shall I abandon him? It were possible for me to part with Queen Kaushalya, Sumitra, my kingdom, even life itself, but I cannot abandon Shri Rama. To behold the heir-apparent causes delight to my heart; when not contemplating him, my mind loses its capacity to act. The world may continue to exist without the sun, crops may grow without water, but I cannot live even for a little while without Shri Ramacandra.", "\u201cTherefore, O Sinful One, give up thine arrogance. See, I put my head at your feet, be gracious to me. Why hast you determined on this cruelty, O Wicked One? If you desires to test my love for Prince Bharata, then do so. When you didst say betimes that Rama, my eldest son, was entitled to the kingdom on account of his virtues, didst you utter these words in flattery to gratify me or to exact some service of Rama?", "\u201cThe tidings of Rama\u2019s installation is causing you a burning discontent. Possessed by an evil spirit, you are not thyself, I wean. O Devi, it is a great calamity that the House of Ikshvaku, famed for its probity, should fall into disrepute.", "\u201cHadst you not been afflicted by an evil spirit or influenced by an inauspicious planet, you wouldst never have spoken to the detriment of others. It is certain that you are possessed by a malignant entity. O Child, you have often said that you didst love Shri Ramacandra, even as Bharata himself. O Devi, how dost you dare to seek the banishment of Ramacandra for fourteen years? How canst you demand the exile of the virtuous and tender Ramacandra for fourteen long years? O You of beautiful eyes, how canst you think of sending Rama into exile, who ever honours you? Rama has paid you greater respect than Bharata. I fail to comprehend how you canst desire his exile. Reflect well, none in the world will offer you greater service, respect and obedience than Rama.", "\u201cAmong the thousands of women and maid-servants in my private apartments, none ever speaks ill of Rama, and he with a pure heart offers protection to every living being, while his subjects ever love and obey him. He has won the hearts of all beings by protecting the interests of the needy and the afflicted. Generosity, faithful service to his preceptor, valour in the field of battle, skill in archery, have all contributed to his renown. Truth, austerity, friendship, purity, simplicity of life, knowledge of philosophy and service of his teacher are well-known qualities of Shri Ramacandra.", "\u201cO Devi, Shri Ramacandra ever acting in the highest interests of all, equal to the maharishis and the gods in enlightenment, must not suffer the ills of exile. Shri Rama has never spoken a harsh word to any, how shall I then, at your instigation, give him this pitiless message? What shall befall me bereft of Rama who is endowed with forgiveness, gratitude, self-control, renunciation, truth and virtue, and who never inflicts pain on any human being?", "\u201cO Kaikeyi, I have grown old and my end is near. In this wretched state I beseech you to show mercy on me. The earth girdled by the sea, and all that is contained therein, shall be thine. Why dost you drive me to the brink of death\u2019s dark abyss?", "\u201cO Kaikeyi, I touch your feet in supplication. Protect Shri Ramacandra and save me from dishonouring my word.\u201d", "King Dasaratha, stricken with grief, fell senseless, his whole frame convulsed and agitated. Again and again he entreated the queen to take him beyond the sea of suffering, but that cruel one growing each instant more adamant, replied: \u201cO King, if you repent of the two boons given to me, none in the world will call you righteous. When other kings question you regarding your promises, O Righteous One, what will be thine answer? Will you say that she to whom you owest your life and by whose grace you yet livest, who rendered you great service at the time of misfortune and to whom you didst promise two boons, has now been refused these blessings?", "\u201cAssuredly you shalt become a stigma on the illustrious dynasty of Ikshvaku, having given promises from which you now wouldst fain withdraw. Recollect King Shivya, who gave the flesh of his own body, to redeem a pledge, was of your royal house. King Alarka, likewise of your dynasty, plucked out his eyes that the sight of an aged and learned brahmin might be restored, and thus obtained the highest state. Not only man is bound by his word, the ocean whose boundaries are fixed, does not pass beyond the shore. Therefore, recollecting your pledge, do not relinquish it. O King, art you bereft of your senses? Abandoning truth, you wouldst grant Rama the kingdom so that you mayest enjoy the embraces of Queen Kaushalya. Be it in accord with dharma or not, be it truth or falsehood, you must fulfil the promise made to me, it shall never be revoked.", "\u201cShould you withdraw your pledge and grant Ramacandra the kingdom, I will give up my life by drinking deadly poison.

Understanding the full portent of the harsh words of Kaikeyi, implying Rama\u2019s exile and the rulership of Bharata, the king remained silent for a long time. His senses numbed, he gazed steadfastly at the face of his beloved queen, speaking thus bitterly.", "Maharajah Dasaratha, afflicted on hearing the threatening speech of Kaikeyi resembling a thunderbolt, inspiring pain and grief, knowing she had resolved to banish Rama, cried out: \u201cO Rama I Rama!\u201d and heaving deep sighs fell to the earth like a felled tree. Like a madman bereft of sense or as one in delirium or a snake hypnotized by incantations, he fell, deprived of his glory. In abject tones, he addressed Kaikeyi, saying: \u201cWho has instructed you in this evil design, cloaked in specious garb? Art you not ashamed to address me as one possessed? Formerly, I did not deem you capable of such conduct; in youth, your disposition was otherwise. What has overpowered you that you seeks such a boon? Stay these unjust words that Rama should go to the forest and Bharata occupy the throne. O Sinful One, O Cruel-hearted One, O Evil Doer, relinquish the insistence on your resolve, for thine own sake and for the sake of your subjects and your son. Either Rama or I must have offended you. How have we done so, that you speakest thus? Assuredly Prince Bharata will never wish to occupy the throne while Rama lives. I deem Bharata no less virtuous than Ramacandra. When instructing Rama to go to the forest, seeing him stricken, how can I look on him? How can I look upon his face darkened like the moon in eclipse? How can I revoke that decision made in consultation with my ministers and friends desiring my welfare, causing confusion, as the sudden smiting of an army by the enemy. What will the kings of other lands say when they hear the breaking of my resolve which was reached by common consent? Will they not say: \u2018King Dasaratha of the House of Ikshvaku is like a child. We marvel that he has ruled so long.\u2019 When the aged, wise and learned brahmins enquire for Rama, shall I answer them that, coerced by Kaikeyi, I have sent him into exile? If I say this in truth, it will be accounted falsehood since I have already instructed my Guru to install Shri Rama as regent. What will his mother, Queen Kaushalya, say, if I banish Rama? How shall I explain this cruel deed to Queen Kaushalya? She is ever dutiful, a friend, serving me as a handmaid, keeping my secrets as a trusted companion, practising virtue like a woman and in attending on my welfare resembling a sister, serving me with delicious food like a mother, ever speaking sweetly to me, ever desiring my good; her son is dearest to me. How can I fail to accord her due respect? Fearing your displeasure, how great would be my subsequent repentance and remorse?", "\u201cAs one partaking of delicious food, really injurious to him, is later filled with regret, so knowing Rama exiled at my command, the terrified Sumitra will place no further faith in me.

It is certain when I command him to go to the forest, he will reply \u2018Be it so, O Sire\u2019. Alas! how much better if it could be otherwise. My beloved child will assuredly not disobey me. Not knowing my true reason, and believing the command to spring from the sincerity of my heart, he will acquiesce and willingly depart; yet all will execrate me if Rama leaves us.", "\u201cDeath, who spares none, will take me to the region of Yama while Shri Ramacandra has gone to the forest, then O Kaikeyi, what grievous injustice will you inflict on your remaining relatives and Queen Kaushalya?

From the seas also water was provided and stored in shining vessels of gold and silver, wherein lotus blooms floated and on whose surface sticks of Gular and banyan were sprinkled.", "Honey, curds, clarified butter, kusha grass, and flowers were also provided. Beautifully adorned singing women were likewise present. Camaras with handles of gold set with jewels, a beautiful canopy, scintillating and round as the moon, were furnished for the ceremony, also a white caparisoned steed, a young elephant of great size, and eight virgins gracefully attired.", "Musicians with vinas, bards and those who proclaim the king\u2019s praise; everything required for the installation of a sovereign of the dynasty of Ikshvaku was furnished by command of the king.

Thinking the installation of Rama to be near, he set out for the palace, passing joyfully along the royal route gay with flags and banners. Hearing on all sides, people conversing of the coming event, he mingled with the happy throng and after walking some distance, saw Shri Rama\u2019s palace, white as the peak of Mount Kailasha and fair as Indra\u2019s abode.", "The turrets, adorned with golden images, studded with coral and jewels, rendered the palace resplendent, like the winter clouds on the caverns of Mount Sumeru. The main gateway, decorated with wreaths of gems and pearls, was fragrant with sandalwood and ambergris, sweet-scented like the Malaygiri mountain and abounding with cranes and peacocks. The doors and walls of the inner apartments were decorated with paintings of lions, tigers and wolves, pleasing to the eye and mind.", "The palace of Rama, resplendent as the sun and moon, furnished like the palace of Kuvera and equalling the abode of Indra, was surrounded by many kinds of birds who sported there. Men from distant lands in bejewelled apparel waited bearing gifts in their hands, eager to behold Rama. The spacious palace was sumptuously furnished and the attendants serving there were men of small stature.", "Shri Sumantra, delighting the people, in his chariot drawn by horses, came to the door of the palace which was filled with untold wealth and surrounded by deer and peacocks gladdening the heart.", "Entering the gates and greeting those dear to Rama, Sumantra reached the door of the inner apartment. There also he heard everyone conversing of Shri Rama and he rejoiced to hear them speaking of his glory. He beheld the inner inclosure, resplendent and lofty as Mount Meru, which was rendered charming by the presence of many deer and birds. There, too, he beheld those from various lands, descending from their chariots, bearing gifts.", "He observed an elephant equal to a hill in height, resembling a dark cloud, who had never known the touch of a goad and whose forehead was dripping with sweat. Its name was Shatrunja, and it stood prepared to carry Rama.", "Proceeding further, Sumantra beheld many charioteers and horsemen ready with their caparisoned horses. Continuing on his way, Shri Rama\u2019s chief minister saw countless artists and poets gathered there.", "Passing through the multitude, he came to the private apartment of Shri Rama. Unchallenged, the great Sumantra, resembling a cloud, entered the apartment as a crocodile enters the gem-filled ocean.", "Passing through a further doorway, thronged with people, Sumantra came to another gate where no guard stood. He beheld there many young men, alert, vigilant, and devoted to their master, armed with bows and axes, and wearing beautiful ear-rings. Beyond these, Sumantra saw aged men, clad in red, gorgeously attired, holding staves in their hands, guarding the apartments of the Queens. Seeing the virtuous Sumantra approaching with others, they stood respectfully at attention.", "Sumantra, addressing these humble and experienced attendants, said: \u201cBe pleased to inform Shri Ramacandra that Sumantra waits at the door.\u201d", "They, ever desiring the good of Rama, informed the prince and Sita of the arrival of Sumantra. Knowing Sumantra to be in the confidence of his royal father, Shri Rama affectionately caused him to be summoned.", "The charioteer, entering there, perceived Shri Ramacandra resembling Kuvera himself, seated on a golden couch, spread with soft cushions and richly ornamented. His brow was anointed with pure and fragrant sandalwood-paste, the colour of the blood of a wild boar.", "By his side the Princess Sita, as beautiful as the moon attended by the Citra planet, was seated, holding a camara in her hand.", "Sumantra, versed in the customs of the court, offered respectful salutations to Shri Rama who appeared as resplendent as the noonday sun. With joined palms, Sumantra humbly enquired as to the prince\u2019s welfare and addressed him who was thus seated on the couch, saying: \u201cO Excellent Son of Queen Kaushalya, the king desires to see you in the apartment of Queen Kaikeyi, be pleased to go thither without delay.\u201d", "Thus addressed, that Lion among men, the most illustrious Ramacandra, filled with joy, on receiving the summons, replied: \u201cBe it so, I will go thither with all speed.\u201d Then turning to Sita, he said: \u201cO Devi, my mother Kaikeyi, and my father have consulted each other concerning those matters relative to my installation. O Princess of Beautiful Eyes, my mother Kaikeyi, ever benevolent and accomplished, knowing the king\u2019s desire, is influencing him for my good! That daughter of the great King of Kaikeya, ever obedient to my royal father desires my welfare. He, with his beloved queen, has sent for me through Sumantra, who is ever well-disposed to me, and desires what is pleasing to me, as does the king, my sire, and the queen, my mother. Assuredly, to-day the king will proclaim me regent. I shall go to my royal father in all haste, do you converse happily with your maids of honour.\u201d", "Hearing these courteous words, spoken by her lord, the lotus-eyed Princess Sita reciting the Peace Chant, followed Shri Ramacandra to the door. She said: \u201cO Maharaj, the kingdom has many learned brahmins who will crown you, as Indra was crowned by Brahma. When the preliminary initiation is completed and you dost perform the Rajasuya sacrifice and I behold you dressed in an antelope skin with the deer\u2019s horns in your hand, do you then allow me to pay you homage. May Indra in the east protect you, may Yama in the south protect you, may Varuna in the west protect you, may Kuvera in the north protect you.\u201d", "Having taken leave of Sita, Shri Rama left his palace with Sumantra. Shri Rama, going forth from his palace, as a lion issues from his cave, beheld Shri Lakshmana humbly waiting at the door.", "At the middle gate, Shri Rama encountered his friends and honoured those who had gathered there to witness his coronation. Then that Lion among men, the son of King Dasaratha, mounted his chariot resplendent as flame, spread with tiger skins and which, on its course, made a noise like thunder. Inlaid with gold and gems, it dazzled the beholders as does the brightness of the sun. The horses yoked to the chariot, equalling young elephants, galloped as swiftly as the steeds of Indra.", "Shri Rama, seated in his resplendent chariot moving rapidly with a sound as of thunder issuing from the clouds, appeared like the moon coursing in the heavens. His younger brother, Prince Lakshmana attended him standing behind him in the chariot, with a camara in his hand.", "On every side, shouts of \u201cJai! Jai!\u201d arose, while the multitude followed Shri Rama\u2019s chariot with its cavalcade of mounted horsemen and mountain-like elephants. Warriors whose brows were anointed with sandalwood paste and ambergris, preceded the royal chariot bearing naked swords in their hands. Then followed the musicians and bards singing their praises and the shouts of warriors resembling the roaring of lions. The chariot went forward amid a rain of flowers showered down from the balconies and windows by beautifully adorned women, of faultless limbs, who thus offered salutations to Rama and desirous of his welfare chanted hymns of adoration, saying: \u201cO Delight of Your Mother, whose heart to-day is raised in exultation because of you; to-day your royal mother will see you in possession of the throne.", "\u201cThe Princess Sita, exceedingly dear to Rama is esteemed the most fortunate woman in the world by womankind who, believing her to have practised a high degree of virtue and ascetism in a previous birth, say, \u201cAs the planet Rohini found union with the moon, so has the Princess Sita found union with Rama.\u201d", "Hearing the delightful eulogies of the women, Raghava pressed on, listening to the converse of the citizens and those come from afar, concerning his approaching coronation. Some said: \u201cTo-day, Shri Ramacandra, our lord, will acquire limitless wealth and power through the favour of his royal sire. Those people over whom he holds sway, will obtain their heart\u2019s desire and the fulfilment of their ambitions. Should he enjoy the kingdom for long, it will be our gain, since no distress will visit the kingdom while he is king.\u201d", "Thus preceded by neighing horses and the praises of his dynasty sung by chroniclers and bards, Rama advanced like the god Kuvera, while on every side he beheld the decorated highways filled with male and female elephants, chariots, horses and people and stalls overflowing with gems and merchandise.", "Seated in his chariot, the prince beheld his delighted friends and the city, white as a cloud, adorned with flags and banners fluttering here and there, fragrant with the perfume of incense, filled with a multitude of men and enriched by stately buildings. Passing through the scented highways where heaps of sandalwood were burning, and rare perfumes, wool and silken cloths, unpierced pearls, and innumerable gems being exposed to view, with stalls replete with articles of food and drink and merchandise of every kind, he beheld the royal highway adorned like the pathvay of the gods in heaven, with every auspicious mark, such as curds, rice, sandalwood, parched grain and milk. Traversing the cross-roads gay with flowers and fragrant objects, amidst the blessings and salutations of his friends, he acknowledged their praise with humility. Those advanced in years, were crying: \u201cO Prince, you who art to be crowned to-day, let your rule resemble your grandfather\u2019s and your great grandfather\u2019s, thus shall we prosper as in the days of thine ancestors, may our happiness exceed even those times. Neither do we require the comforts of this world, nor those of the other world. Beholding Shri Ramacandra returning after his coronation, our delight will exceed all else. Nothing is dearer to us than the installation of Shri Ramacandra of limitless glory.\u201d", "Thus did Raghava advance, amidst the eulogies of his friends the focus of every eye and heart, serene and imperturbable. Those who were unable to behold him or were unnoticed by him, became objects of contempt to others, nay, they were a reproach to themselves. The all-compassionate Ramacandra looked on each of the four castes with equal condescension. Each loved him according to his capacity.", "Passing the temples, the sacred groves and pavilions, Shri Ramacandra circumambulated them in reverence. He now beheld the royal palace, resembling a white cloud, its towers like the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kailasa, its balconies seeming almost to reach the skies like the fire chariots of the gods; the pleasure houses set with precious gems, caused the whole palace to excel all those on earth and rival even the abode of Indra.", "Approaching his father\u2019s palace, Shri Rama passed through the three gateways guarded by archers, and proceeded on foot through the fourth and fifth enclosures. There, leaving his attendants, he entered the private apartments of the king.", "The multitude seeing Rama enter the palace were filled with joy and awaited his coming forth as the sea awaits the coming of the full moon.", "[full title: Shri Rama sees the king full of anguish and speechless; Kaikeyi utters the cruel words].", "Entering the private apartment, Shri Ramacandra beheld King Dasaratha full of distress, his countenance pale, seated with Kaikeyi on the royal couch. First placing his head at the feet of his royal sire, he then respectfully offered salutations to Mother Kaikeyi.", "The king, his eyes filled with tears, his throat choked with emotion, could only utter the word \u201cRama\u201d and nothing more. As the heart of a man who accidentally touches a serpent is filled with fear, so was the heart of Rama on beholding the king\u2019s misery. The king agitated by grief and remorse, sighing bitterly, filled with anguish, resembled the ocean which, calm by nature, is agitated by a mighty storm, or Rahu causing the sun\u2019s eclipse, or the soul of a sage stirred by the utterance of falsehoods. Without knowing the cause of the king\u2019s distress, Shri Rama became agitated like the sea on the day of the full moon. Shri Ramacandra, ever engaged in seeking his father\u2019s welfare, reflected: \u201cWhy is my father not happy to see me to-day? Formerly, when displeased, on beholding me he was pacified, but to-day, beholding me, he is troubled. Why is he overcome with grief and bereft of his glory?\u201d", "Making obeisance to Kaikeyi, he said: \u201cIf by an involuntary offence, I have caused my father displeasure, then O Mother, propitiate him for me. Erstwhile, even when displeased, my father showed favour to me, but to-day, I behold him pale of countenance, and deeply distressed, nor does he speak to me. Is my revered father suffering any physical or mental distress? It is rare indeed for a man to be consistently happy. Has his majesty seen any grievous fault in the amiable Prince Bharata or the valorous Shatrughna, or in my mothers or in me? I do not desire to live a single instant if his majesty is not satisfied with me, or is displeased or if I have disobeyed him. Why should not man obey his parents, who are the source of his birth and who are living gods? Hast you spoken harsh words, in vanity, to the king, on hearing which his heart is lacerated? O Devi, answer my question truly. Tell me the cause of this unprecedented grief in my sire.\u201d", "Kaikeyi thus addressed by Shri Rama, dead to all shame and skilful in defence of her selfish purpose, spoke arrogantly: \u201cO Rama, the king is not angry nor is he suffering physical pain, he has something on his mind which he fears to disclose to you. He loves you dearly and so hesitates to tell you this unpleasant matter. It is for you to fulfil what he has promised to me and to act in accordance with it. Having formerly granted me a boon, he now repents it like a common man. To promise a boon and then seek to evade it, is like the setting up of a dam when the water has gone. O Rama, have a care lest the king abandon truth for your sake. Among holy men, truth is said to be the root of dharma. Should the king command you and you fulfil his command without further deliberation, then will I reveal the whole truth to you. The king may not communicate with you directly, therefore, be ready to execute what I command on his behalf.\u201d", "Shri Rama, highly agitated, replied to Kaikeyi in the presence of the king: \u201cFor shame, O Devi, to speak thus to me. At the command of my father I am willing to do anything, even to casting myself into the fire. At the bidding of the king my parent and author of my welfare, I will gladly drink deadly poison or throw myself into the sea. O Devi, disclose to me his will, I vow to fulfil his command. Be assured, O Mother, Rama does not utter falsehood.\u201d", "To the ever truthful Rama, Kaikeyi answered in these wounding words: \u201cO Ramacandra, long ago the Maharajah fought against the asuras and fell wounded on the field. I then preserved him and he promised me two boons. For these I ask the installation of Prince Bharata and your exile to the Dandaka forest. O Great One, if you desirest that you and your father should uphold truth, then hear me. In obedience to your father, now go into exile for fourteen years. Let the preparations made for thine installation be used for the enthronement of Bharata. Giving up your claims to the kingdom, do you with matted hair, wearing a deer skin, live in the Dandaka forest for seven and again seven years. Let the earth be ruled by Prince Bharata. This kingdom filled with an abundance of gems, horses and elephants must be his. On account of this is the king distressed, his countenance pale and he is unable to look on you. O Rama, obey the king and preserve him by fulfilling his command.\u201d", "At these cruel words of Kaikeyi, Shri Ramacandra betrayed no sign of distress, but the king realising the future suffering of his son was overwhelmed with grief.", "The slayer of his foes, Shri Ramacandra, hearing the words of Kaikeyi, keen as the pangs of death, was in no way moved by them, and answered: \u201cBe it so! To honour the promise made by the king, I will leave for the forest immediately, with matted locks, attired in raiment made of bark, but I desire to know why the illustrious sovereign does not address me? O Devi, fear not, I vow, in your presence that I shall dwell in the forest, dressed in bark with matted locks; rejoice, therefore! Whatever command the benevolent monarch, ever mindful of my welfare, shall lay upon me, I will gladly execute to please him. There is nothing I would not do for him without hesitation, but one painful thought still lingers in my mind. Why does the king not speak to me himself of Bharata\u2019s enthronement? O Mother, by thine order, I am willing to surrender to my brother Bharata, not only the kingdom, but also Sita, together with every object of desire, my wealth and my life. How much more would I do for my father, that he may preserve the vow of truth and serve your purpose. Render this matter clear to the king. How is it that I behold my father with bowed head, shedding tears? Let messengers on swift horses summon Prince Bharata immediately from his uncle\u2019s house, while I, without considering the merit or demerit of my sire\u2019s injunctions, enter the Dandaka forest for fourteen years.\u201d", "Queen Kaikeyi highly pleased by the words uttered by Shri Ramacandra and assured of his exile, urged him to depart, saying: \u201cSo be it; messengers on swift footed horses will summon Bharata immediately from his uncle\u2019s home. O Rama, being ready to enter the forest, do not delay: depart, therefore, with all speed. Overcome with shame, the king dare not ask you to depart, but do you disregard this. O Ramacandra, the king will neither bathe nor partake of food till you have entered upon thine exile.\u201d", "The king, hearing the words of Kaikeyi, cried \u201cWoe\u201d, \u201cWoe\u201d, and, stricken with grief, fell senseless on the golden couch. Raising up the king, Shri Ramacandra, urged on by the words of Kaikeyi as a horse under the lash, prepared to enter the forest in all haste. His heart unmoved by the queen\u2019s cruel words, he replied: \u201cO Devi, I did not desire the kingdom to acquire wealth and power, but becoming regent, I wished to preserve dharma. Know me, like the sages, to be a protector of dharma. If I can render any service to my father at the cost of my life, it is as if already accomplished. There is no greater good in this world than service to one\u2019s sire by thought, word and deed. On this command, not issued by the king but by you, I will dwell for fourteen years in the uninhabited forest. O Sati, you have been my mother and yet art unacquainted with my nature. If you had\u2019st known me, no need would have arisen to consult my father on so insignificant a matter. Now I go to take leave of my mother, Queen Kaushalya, and offer consolation to my Sita. Let Bharata rule the kingdom according to dharma and serve our royal father faithfully. This is a son\u2019s abiding duty.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Shri Ramacandra, the king, speechless and overcome with grief, wept aloud, shedding bitter tears. The most illustrious Rama made obeisance to his father lying pitifully there and, then bowing to the feet of Kaikeyi, left the apartment. Having circumambulated the King and Queen Kaikeyi with extreme reverence, Shri Ramacandra came forth from the inner chamber and beheld his friends standing at the door. Shri Lakshmana full of wrath, his eyes suffused with tears, followed Rama.", "Shri Rama circumambulated the sacred articles prepared for the installation ceremony in great reverence, and prayed that they should be dedicated to the installation of Prince Bharata. Then turning from them, without a backward glance he slowly withdrew.", "The abandoning of the ceremony failed to impair the serenity of Shri Ramacandra, the splendour of his countenance remained unchanged as the moon suffers no diminution of its beauty in the waning period. On renouncing the kingdom and departing for exile, Shri Ramacandra resembled a great yogi and none observed any change of mood in him.", "Relinquishing the royal canopy, the beautiful camara and bidding a respectful and affectionate farewell to his friends and the people\u2019s delegates and guests, remembering the sorrow occasioned to them, and restraining his senses, the prince went to the apartments of his mother, to break the distressing tidings to her. Those about him found no change in him, neither in the adornments of his body, donned in preparation for the royal ceremony, nor in the cheerfulness of his countenance. Such was the truthful Ramacandra. As the autumnal moon does not lose its splendour, so the cheerfulness of the mighty-armed Rama did not diminish. Addressing those standing near with sweetness and respect, he approached his mother Kaushalya.", "The most valorous Prince Lakshmana, the sharer of his brother\u2019s joys and griefs, followed him. Aware of the great distress that would arise in the hearts of his friends, Shri Rama for his mother\u2019s sake entered the palace in a serene and cheerful mood.", "Perceiving that Lion among men, Shri Ramacandra, his palms joined in a gesture of farewell, coming forth from his father\u2019s apartments, the ladies of the inner chamber began to lament loudly, saying: \u201cShall Shri Rama, who fulfilled all our desires without awaiting the injunction of his royal sire and who is our sole refuge, to-day go into exile?", "\u201cFrom his birth he has honoured and respected us as his own mother, Queen Kaushalya. When we have spoken harsh words to him, he was never angry, nor did he ever give any cause for displeasure. That prince who ever reconciled those who were affronted, is to-day going into exile. Our king, acting like an ignorant man, is determined to destroy his subjects and is sending Rama, who is the sole support of all beings, into exile.\u201d", "Thus, weeping bitterly, all the maids of honour and maid-servants of the king lamented like cows bereft of their calves. The king hearing their cries of distress, deeply afflicted with grief for his son, overcome with shame, fell down on his couch. Shri Ramacandra, grieving for the woes of his relatives, breathing like a mighty elephant approached his mother\u2019s apartments with Lakshmana.", "Entering there, he beheld at the first gate the venerable and aged guardian of the door and his attendants, who rose on perceiving the prince, crying \u201cJai\u201d \u201cJai\u201d to him. Reaching the second gate, he met with the aged brahmins honoured by the state for their great learning. Saluting them, he entered the third gate where women, the aged and children were keeping guard. The women gave their blessings to the prince and went to inform the Queen Kaushalya of Shri Rama\u2019s arrival.", "According to scriptural injunctions, the queen had spent the whole night worshipping Shri Vishnu, desirous of her son\u2019s good. Clad in a silken sari, she was pouring oblations into the sacred fire, with joy. Shri Rama, entering the chamber of his mother, beheld her offering oblations into the sacred flame; he beheld there the sacrificial articles prepared for the worship of the gods; curds, rice, butter, sweetmeats, rice cooked in milk, garlands of white flowers, sesamum seed, fuel and jars filled with pure water.", "Shri Rama saw the fair complexioned queen in a white robe, emaciated through long fasts. After a time, perceiving her son, Shri Ramacandra, she ran towards him as a mare runs to meet its foal. Embracing him, inspired by maternal love, she addressed the great Rama with gentle and affectionate words: \u201cO my Son, mayest you become aged and righteous like the royal sages. Mayest you attain the age appropriate to your dynasty. Mayest you acquire renown and fulfil your family duties. O Dear Prince, now approach your truth-loving father, who awaits you to-day to appoint you regent of the kingdom.\u201d", "Offering her son a seat, she placed before him sweetmeats; Shri Rama, touching them only, with joined palms humbly addressed her; he, ever affectionate and now showing even greater tenderness in protecting his mother\u2019s honour, said: \u201cO Goddess, you are not yet acquainted with the great calamity that threatens us. I must go to the Dandaka forest and have come to seek your sanction. It is the season of sorrow for you, Sita and Lakshmana. Now, entering the forest, my seat will be of kusha grass and there, residing for fourteen years, I shall live on honey, roots and fruits. The king has conferred the regency on Prince Bharata and I, giving up royal fare, must enter the forest to eat the food of ascetics there. By the king\u2019s command, Bharata will be installed as regent. For fourteen years, it is ordained that I shall live in the forest, practising asceticism far from the haunts of men. The forest from henceforth will be my home; roots and berries will be my food!\u201d", "Hearing these words, the queen fell to the ground like the bough of a fir tree severed from the trunk, by an axe 1 Resembling a nymph fallen from heaven or a phantom tree struck down, she fell. Shri Ramacandra raised her to her couch, her body soiled with dust, like a steed that has rolled on the earth and gently brushed away the dust with his own hands. The queen, worthy of every happiness, seated by her son, filled with distress, addressed him in the presence of Shri Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cO Child, O Rama, hadst you not been born of my womb, I should have suffered the distress of being childless, but I should have been spared this sorrow. O My Son, were I a barren woman, I should not have been thus afflicted, for a barren woman has but one grief, that of being childless. The fortune that befalls a wife, alas! was not to be enjoyed by me for long! Having a son, I looked for happiness, but now, though chief queen, I must bear the piercing words of my rival consorts, no longer showing me deference. What greater calamity can befall a woman? The insults that will be heaped upon me, without you, will prove unendurable. Alas! This is the season of unfathomable grief and affliction! O My Son, when you are gone, I shall cease to live. As chief queen, I have already borne great provocation; now, serving Kaikeyi, I shall be deemed lower than her maidservant, indeed some say I am already her slave. Those who attend me, will desert me on beholding Bharata made regent.\u201d", "Then Queen Kaushalya growing angry, began to utter bitter words, saying: \u201cHow shall I, thus afflicted, look on the face of Kaikeyi? O Rama, seventeen years have passed since you didst receive the holy thread. Since then, I have lived in expectation of thine installation and the termination of my sorrows, but now I must suffer further. I shall not be able to endure this. O Rama, I shall not be able to suffer the contumely of the other queens in my old age. O Child, not beholding your countenance resembling the full moon, how shall I bear this miserable life? I have kept innumerable fasts, worshipped the gods and nourished you till now, yet unfortunate as I am, it has proved to be in vain. Surely my heart is made of stone that it has not broken to-day, it resembles a river in the rainy season that does not overflow under continued rain. Surely death has forgotten me or there is no room in his abode. Had it not been so, he would have carried me hence to-day like a doe carried away by a lion. Assuredly my heart must be as hard as iron that it is not riven under this affliction. O why does not the earth open and engulf me; it seems one cannot die before the time appointed. Those sacred austerities, fasts, meditation and penance undertaken for the prosperity of my child have proved vain, like seeds sown in a barren field. If at this time of sorrow, I might die, threatened with your separation, I should embrace death as willingly as a cow deprived of its calf. O My Son, of what use is life now to me, robbed of the sight of your face resembling the full moon? Nay, I will follow you to the forest like a feeble cow following its calf.\u201d", "Queen Kaushalya, the mother of Rama, afflicted and helpless, realising her own unfortunate position, and her son to be bound in the service of truth, lamented like a kinnari whose offspring has been made captive.", "[Full title: Shri Rama, in spite of the laments of the queen and Shri Lakshmana, prepares for departure].", "Shri Lakshmana, overcome with grief, addressed Mother Kaushalya in words suited to the occasion. He said: \u201cO Mother, it cannot be pleasing to you that Rama, at the command of the king, who is subject to a woman, and oblivious of the prosperity of the kingdom, should go to the forest. Old age has impaired the intellect of the monarch who, impelled by desire, is no longer master of his senses; what words will he not utter? I see no fault in Ramacandra for which he should be exiled and deprived of his kingdom. I know no man whether friend or foe who can find fault with Rama even in absence. Like a god, he is guileless, self-controlled and forbearing even to his foes; what righteous king would abandon such a son without cause? What son versed in the discharge of a sovereign\u2019s duties would give obedience to so puerile a king?\u201d", "Addressing Rama, Lakshmana continued: \u201cO Brother, before the multitude become acquainted with these tidings, assume the reins of the kingdom, I will assist you in the undertaking. O Raghava, who will dare oppose you, when like death itself, I stand by your side, armed with my bow? If two or three, nay if all the people of Ayodhya resist you in thine undertaking, I will destroy them. If all the supporters of Bharata oppose you, not even one shall escape. The meek are ever oppressed. Should our father, inspired by Kaikeyi, become our enemy, then, though worthy of protection, I will undoubtedly slay him! Even should a spiritual preceptor, prompted by egoity, follow the evil path and do what ought not to be done, he must be restrained.", "\u201cOn what authority does the king confer the kingdom on the son of Kaikeyi, when the son of the chief queen, rightly heir to the throne, still lives? O Slayer of your Foes, who will dare to incur our enmity and give Bharata the kingdom?", "\u201cO Mother, I swear by the truth, by my bow, by the laws of charity, by the merit acquired in worshipping the gods, that I am Shri Rama\u2019s willing servant. O Devi, should Rama enter the blazing fire or the dark forest, know I shall have preceded him. O Goddess, do you and Shri Ramacandra behold my prowess by which I shall destroy all your sufferings, as the sun destroys darkness. I will also slay the king enslaved by Kaikeyi, who is aged, contemptible, of unsubdued mind and in his second childhood.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the noble Lakshmana, Queen Kaushalya was overcome with grief and said to Shri Ramacandra: \u201cO Child, you knowest the content of your brother\u2019s heart, now act as you considerest meet. It does not befit you to abandon your sorrow-stricken mother at the unjust words of her rival. O Righteous One, if you are established in dharma, then remain here, serve me and acquire virtue. There is no higher duty than service of the mother. I am, with the king, equally an object of your reverence, and I command you not to go to the forest. In your separation, there is no occasion for rejoicing, neither do I desire to live, but with you I will gladly live, sustaining myself on herbs alone. If you, leaving me afflicted with grief, go to the forest, then shall I refuse food and yield up my life. Then, O My Son, being responsible for my death you will, like Samudra, unmindful of your mother, enter hell.\u201d", "Seeing his mother, the Queen Kaushalya, thus lamenting, the righteous Ramacandra spoke to her dutifully, saying: \u201cO Goddess, I cannot disregard my father\u2019s commands, therefore I bow before you and entreat your favour and sanction to enter the forest. Know that the Sage Kandu, a great pundit, acquainted with his yogic duty, slew a cow in obedience to his father\u2019s commands, knowing it to be a sin, which was thereafter not charged against him.", "\u201cIn ancient times, likewise, in our own dynasty, the sons of King Sagara, digging the earth, sacrificed their lives at their father\u2019s behest. At the command of his father, the son of Jamadagnya, Parasurama, with his axe, cut off the head of his mother Renuka. O Devi, these and other godlike men have obeyed their father resolutely. I, too, without hesitation, shall perform that which benefits my father. O Mother, not I alone obey my father but all those virtuous men, mentioned by me, have been obedient to their father\u2019s will. I follow no new law, nor one contrary to the traditions of the royal dynasty, but tread the path of my illustrious ancestors. I am accomplishing nought which has not already been accomplished in this world. He who acts in accordance with his father\u2019s commands does not fall from virtue.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to his mother, Shri Rama addressed Lakshmana, saying: \u201cO Lakshmana, I am acquainted with thine immeasurable love for me, your valour and your prowess; none can withstand you. O Lakshmana, my mother endowed with every good quality is now subject to misery and grief through ignorance of dharma and lack of resignation. O Brother, dharma is the highest good on earth, Truth and dharma are one. My father\u2019s command is founded on dharma, hence it is superior to my mother\u2019s ruling. O Hero, it is unworthy in one seeking the supreme fruit of dharma, not to fulfil the promise made to his father, mother or a learned brahmin, I cannot, therefore, disregard my father\u2019s command. O Hero, inspired by my father, Mother Kaikeyi has urged me to this course, therefore, O Lakshmana, relinquish the idea of bloodshed and embracing the state of virtue, follow me.\u201d", "Thus lovingly addressing Lakshmana, with bowed head and in great humility Rama turned to Queen Kaushalya and said: \u201cO Goddess, now grant me permission to go into exile. In my absence pray for me. Having honoured my vow, I shall return, like King Yayati who falling to earth from heaven, again ascended thither. O Mother, comfort my unhappy father. Have no anxiety, O Mother, I shall return after fourteen years as desired by my father. Do you, Sita, Lakshmana and Sumitra obey my royal sire. This is the ancient tradition. O Mother, disregarding the preparations made for mine installation, let your mind be freed from grief and allow me to go into exile as ordained by dharma.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Rama, inspired by righteous motives, spoken with courage and equanimity, Queen Kaushalya as one restored to life, gazed steadfastly at Rama and said: \u201cO My Son, if you are versed in dharma and art mindful of the good done to you by your parents, then am I as woithy of your respect as your father. O My Son, do not abandon thine unfortunate mother and enter the forest. O My Child, of what use is my life without you? The earth, the region of the pittris, heaven and the region of Mahaloka, which are the abodes of highest bliss, for me are all void without you. An hour with you is my greatest delight O My Son.\u201d", "Shri Rama, hearing his mother\u2019s lament, was agitated, like a king who is perturbed, when on a dark night his torch-bearers are assailed on the way.", "Then the dutiful Rama again addressed his mother rendered almost senseless with grief and Lakshmana distressed and disquieted, and spoke to them for their good, in words that were full of integrity:\u2014", "\u201cO Lakshmana, I know of your prowess and the intensity of your devotion to me, but now in opposition to my purpose, you dost increase my mother\u2019s misery. O Brother, there are three means to happiness in this world, they are righteousness, prosperity and pleasure. Those who love righteousness should pursue it as a wife acquires merit by being obedient to her husband, and pleasure by endearing herself to him and prosperity by becoming a mother. That undertaking which does not ensure these three, should be given up and that by which they are secured should be carried out. He who pursues prosperity alone, is without friends and has many enemies, and he who is devoted to pleasure, which is not based on righteousness, is an object of contempt. O Brother, the king is firstly our preceptor, secondly our father and thirdly he is an aged man. From the point of view of dharma, I must obey his commands, whether they are inspired by anger or desire. As a righteous man, I must fulfil his behests. Rare is the son so ruthless as to disobey his father. How can I evade the behests of my sire, who is my parent and has full authority over me as a king, and further is the consort of my dear mother Kaushalya? How, therefore, should the queen, abandoning the virtuous king, her lord, follow me like a widowed woman? O Goddess, grant me permission to leave for the forest whilst you dost recite the Peace Chant, that my vow may be accomplished.", "\u201cLike King Yayati of old who returned to heaven, inspired by his love of truth, I, too, shall return. O Mother, I dare not disobey my father for the sake of a mere kingdom! Life is brief and I have no desire for the rulership of the world through the sacrifice of virtue.\u201d", "The mighty Rama thus acquainting his mother with his intention of entering the forest as demanded by Kaikeyi, circumambulated the Queen Kaushalya, fixing his heart on his departure.", "Shri Ramacandra then turned to Shri Lakshmana, who unable to endure his distress, full of wrath against Kaikeyi, his eyes distorted, was breathing heavily like a mighty elephant. Addressing him in terms of affection as a beloved brother and friend, patiently calming his fears, Rama said: \u201cO Brother, give up grief and anger and arm thyself with patience, forgetting the preparations made for mine installation, make thyself ready for my departure to the forest. O Lakshmana, prepare with the same zeal as you didst prepare for my coronation. The mind of my mother, Kaikeyi, is clouded with suspicion on account of my proposed enthronement, therefore, O Lakshmana, act so that her suspicions may be allayed. O Brother, Mother Kaikeyi believes you will use force to place me on the throne. This I cannot endure, nor can I suffer her to experience anxiety. At no time, do I recollect that I have voluntarily given cause for offence to my parents. O Lakshmana, let us relieve the apprehensions of our royal father, ever truthful and valiant but now fearful lest his future life be jeopardized. If I do not abandon the desire for the crown, the distress caused to the heart of the king, at the violation of his vow, will be mine also. O Lakshmana, because of this, I desire to enter the forest without delay, abandoning the project of mine installation. Thinking her purpose accomplished, Queen Kaikeyi will to-day, if I depart for the forest, cause her son Bharata to be summoned and will make over the kingdom to him with joy. The heart of Kaikeyi will find no rest till I, dressed in a deer skinj with matted locks, enter the forest. I cannot grieve her, who has urged me to go to the forest and contributed to my resolution, therefore, I will depart without delay. O Lakshmana, the acquisition of the kingdom is not part of my destiny. If providence had favoured me, Kaikeyi would not have desired to send me to the forest. O Dear One, you knowest no distinction was made by me between my three mothers, nor has Kaikeyi looked on me as different from Prince Bharata, but to-day to frustrate my coronation and send me into exile, she has uttered cruel and pitiless words. This is the will of God and nought else. Had it not been so, how should Kaikeyi the daughter of a king, of gentle disposition and noble nature, speak thus like a vulgar woman in the presence of her husband? Whatever is inscrutable to man should be known to be the decree of providence; even Brahma cannot evade the consequences of karma. It is this unalterable and fixed decree that has created the dissension between Kaikeyi and me, not to be understood by man.", "\u201cPleasure, pain, fear, anger, profit and loss, life and death, and similar matters come into being as a result of our karma. Even the sages practising great austerities, prompted by their karma, abandoning asceticism have been swept away by concupiscence and avarice. This sudden happening, never apprehended, this frustration of a well-devised plan is the work of karma. Therefore, I in no wise regret my resolve nor the cancellation of my coronation. Do you also abandon grief and following me forget the preparations for the coronation. O Lakshmana, with these vessels of water brought hither for mine installation, let my dedication to the ascetic life, be made. Yet what use have I now for these sacred waters? From now on, I shall draw water with mine own hands for every ritual.", "\u201cO Lakshmana, do not grieve that the installation ceremony remains unperformed. We know by reason and discernment that there is little difference between ruling a kingdom and living in a forest. O Lakshmana, do not for an instant blame Queen Kaikeyi for obstructing my coronation; prompted by karma, men say what is unlawful.\u201d", "[Full title: Shri Lakshmana offers to defeat all those who obstruct Shri Rama\u2019s installation].", "Instructed by his brother, Lakshmana, his head bowed, was filled with distress on account of Shri Rama\u2019s impending departure, yet glad to learn the secret of dharma. Remaining in the cave of anger awhile, breathing like a snake provoked in its hole, his frowning mien resembling an enraged lion, swaying like the trunk of an elephant, with quivering limbs, averting his gaze, he addressed his elder brother, saying: \u201cO Brother, in this evil hour, you are subject to a great delusion. Ill-timed is this assertion that disobedience to a parent is contrary to dharma. It does not become one virtuous as you are to speak thus. You, a leader among warriors, canst control your fate, yet like a weak man you speakest of it as irrevocable. Dost you respect these wicked beings, O Virtuous One? Dost you not know how many deceivers appear as righteous men? Take note how the king and Kaikeyi for selfish ends deceive you and send you into exile. If this matter of the boons granted to Kaikeyi were true, then why was it not revealed\u2019ere the preparations for your installation were made? If it can be said it was done in error, then that error is a calamity. It will cause dissension among the people. How can the younger take precedence over the elder in matters of state? I cannot suffer this, O Great Hero, pardon me. This law you praises, by which your mind is governed, is incomprehensible to me. You who art powerful, why must you submit to Kaikeyi? Will you obey the unjust command of your father, contrary to the law of dharma? Dost you not perceive their duplicity, in frustrating thine installation under the pretext of granting a boon? I consider the pursuit of such a course to be worthy of condemnation. This is the reason for my distress. Though our parents, the King and Kaikeyi, desire to harm you and are swayed by passion, who, except you, would countenance their design? Yet you attributest this matter to the decree of fate. This action is unpleasing to me. Let the weak and the cowardly trust in so uncertain a fate, heroes and men of patient resolve, do not accept the dictates of karma. He, who by his own endeavours, conquers fate, never suffers. Let it be seen to-day whether fate or exertion prevail.", "\u201cThat destiny which prevents thine installation, which resembles an elephant refusing to respond to the goad, and having broken its fetters, is wandering about unchecked, that decree will I conquer by my prowess.", "\u201cNeither the guardians of the four quarters, nor all the dwellers in the Three Worlds, united as one, can prevent thine installation, how much less then, my father? Those who have planned thine exile, shall themselves pass fourteen years in exile. I will frustrate the hopes of my father and Kaikeyi, who, depriving you of the kingdom, seek to enthrone Bharata. The power of karma will not bring such adversity to those opposed to us as my valour shall inflict on them! After ruling a thousand years, do you retire to the forest, leaving your sons to govern the kingdom, then, like our ancestors, who, becoming aged, withdrew to a hermitage, do you continue to live in the forest. Formerly, kings in their declining years, giving over their subjects to the governance of their sons and grandsons, used to retire to the forest as ascetics. If, O Rama, you fearest to rule against the behests of the king, thinking the administration would be insecure, I will protect your kingdom as the shore protects the earth from the inroads of the sea. If I fail, may I never be called a hero! Now fix your mind on thine enthronement with these auspicious preparations; singlehanded I can effect the defeat of the kings who obstruct thine installation. These two arms of mine are not for show, nor is my bow a mere decoration. My sword was never meant to dangle at my side, nor are my arrows designed to be kept in the quiver! All these are dedicated to the task of destroying the enemy. I will not brook the existence of my foes. With my keen bright sword, I will hew their bodies to pieces, even if it be Indra himself. I will cut to pieces elephants, horses and men with my sword, creating large heaps and rendering advance impossible. To-day, my enemies shall fall like clouds rent by lightning. Donning the godha, lifting up my bow, I shall strike the enemy with many shafts and large numbers of them with a single arrow. I shall destroy innumerable soldiers, horses and elephants by piercing their most vulnerable parts with my shafts. To-day I shall demonstrate the power of my weapons and establish your sovereignty. To-day these two arms accustomed to be adorned with ornaments and sandalpaste and used to distributing charity and to protecting friends, shall prove their prowess by opposing those who obstruct thine installation. O Ramacandra, I am your servant, tell me who is your foe and command me to oppose him so that severing them from their fame and friends, the kingdom be placed in your hands.\u201d", "Shri Ramacandra, hearing the words of Lakshmana, wiping away his tears, consoled him, saying: \u201cO Dear One, know my chief valour to be obedience to the will of my father; it behoves the virtuous to fulfil their father\u2019s command.\u201d", "[Full title: The queen realises she has no power to restrain Shri Rama\u2019s resolution].", "Seeing the righteous Ramacandra determined to obey his sire, Queen Kaushalya, her eyes filled with tears and her throat choked with emotion, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, you have never experienced hardship.

He whose servants live on sweetmeats and butter, how will that Rama of mine be able to live on roots and fruit? Who will not feel insecurity, knowing King Dasaratha to have banished his illustrious and virtuous son? If he acts thus to such a son, what of myself? If Ramacandra, beloved of all, is compelled to enter the forest, then undoubtedly destiny (past karma) rules our joys and sorrows. O Child, the fire of grief in my heart, fanned by the wind of thine absence, fed on lamentation and affliction; stimulated by tears, emitting the smoke of anxiety, will utterly consume and destroy me, like a forest fire at the end of winter reduces the bushes, creepers and grass to ashes. O Child, as a cow runs after its calf, so shall I follow you wheresoever you goest.\u201d", "Rama, listening to the sorrowful speech of Queen Kaushalya, replied: \u201cO Mother, the king is sorely distressed by the deceit of Kaikeyi, and I also must leave him when I go to the forest.

The king is our master, how should we be masterless while the king lives? Bharata also is virtuous, humble and devoted to the good of all. He will undoubtedly treat you with respect and not oppose you. When I am gone, let not the king suffer on account of my separation, and let him not be overcome by this great grief. The king is now aged, it becomes you to serve him with every care. Even a virtuous woman, devoted to piety and fasting, if negligent towards her consort, comes to a sinner\u2019s state, but she who is devoted to her lord attains heaven. The woman who is ever devoted to her husband and ever ready to seek his welfare, attains heaven, even if she has not worshipped any god. Service of the husband is a duty sanctioned by ancient tradition, by the Veda and by the scriptural law. O Mother, undertake those rituals promoting universal peace and serve the gods with floral offerings. For my sake, give hospitality to pious and learned brahmins and await my return.

Long ago my father, a lover of truth, granted two boons to my mother Kaikeyi. Beholding the preparations for my coronation, Kaikeyi demanded the fulfilment of her boons and has now gained ascendency over his mind. In accordance with the two boons granted to her, it is mine to pass fourteen years in the Dandaka forest and Prince Bharata to be installed as regent. I am now going into exile and have come to bid you farewell. Let no words in praise of me be repeated to Prince Bharata, lest he withhold his protection from you. It is for you to submit to his will for die sake of your support. The king has conferred the regency on Prince Bharata forever. It behoves you to act in such a way that he be not displeased with you. O Wise One, now I go to the forest in obedience to my father\u2019s behest, remain here with a quiet heart. O Sinless One, when dressed as a hermit I leave for the forest, then do you also cease to adorn thyself. Rising early, do you worship the gods according to the prescribed rituals, then, approaching my father and mother, offer obeisance to them. My mother, Queen Kaushalya, having grown old, is afflicted on account of my departure, it becomes you to serve her with respect. My other mothers should be honoured and served by you like Queen Kaushalya, their hearts are also full of love towards me. Like my own mother Kaushalya, they have also cherished me, therefore I deem them worthy of the same honour. My brothers Bharata and Shatrughna should be regarded by you as your brothers or your sons. It behoves you never to provoke Prince Bharata, from now ruler of the kingdom and chief of the family. Served with sincerity, a king is pleased, but if provoked, he becomes full of wrath. A monarch renounces his own offspring if they oppose him and receives even strangers, as friends, who have promoted his welfare. O Kalyani, obeying King Bharata, remain here, seeking his good. O Dear One, I shall enter the great forest, it behoves you to remain here; I charge you to act in such a manner that no one will be displeased.\u201d", "The sweet-speaking Sita, worthy of Rama\u2019s love, thus being instructed to remain in Ayodhya, though filled with affection, indignantly replied: \u201cO Offspring of a great king, O Rama, how canst you speak in such wise? O Prince, your words evoke laughter. O Chief of Men, father, mother, son and daughter-in-law live according to their merit and dependent on it, but a wife enjoys the fortune of her husband since she is a part of himself. I am therefore entitled to share your father\u2019s command and also go into exile.", "\u201cThe happiness of a woman depends on her husband, neither father, mother, son, relative or companion avail her at death; in this world and in the other world, the husband alone is her all-in-all. If you to-day depart for the forest, I will precede you on foot, clearing the thorns and kusha grass from your path. O Hero, relinquishing anger and pride, take me with you without hesitation. There is no fault in me that merits my remaining here, without you. The joy experienced by lords of men whether dwelling in a palace or transported in an aerial chariot through the heavens or possessing the eightfold psychic powers, is far inferior to the joy of the wife in the service of her lord. My royal father has instructed me fully in the duties of a wife and, therefore, I have no need of further instruction in the matter. Assuredly I shall accompany you to the forest, uninhabited by men, filled with savage beasts, such as bears and bulls.

O Hero, I will wander with you in the forest according to the ancient spiritual ordinance, free from desire for pleasure, traversing the honey-scented woodland. O Lord of my Life, since you canst protect and support innumerable people, canst you not more easily protect me? Without doubt to-day I shall enter the forest with you, O Fortunate Prince, none can break my resolve. I shall live happily on fruits and roots with you in the forest, causing you no anxiety. Under the protection of one as wise as you, O Lord, I desire to enjoy the beauty of lakes, mountains and rivers without hindrance. O Rama, I long with you to see the beautiful lakes where swans and kavandava birds play and charming lotuses bloom. There will I bathe with you, O My Lotus-eyed Lord, sporting there with you. Thus would I pass a thousand years with you, the happiness enjoyed in your company renders even the delights of heaven distasteful to me. O Prince, without you, heaven itself would not please me. I long to enter the forest with you where deer, monkeys and elephants roam. O Prince, serving your holy feet, I will pass the time there as happily as in my royal father\u2019s house.

O Frail Princess, act according to my will. Life in the forest is fraught with misery, O Sita, relinquish the thought of sharing my exile, many are the dangers there. The forest is named \u2018Antara\u2019, meaning it is unfit for human habitation. For thine own well-being, I advise you to remain here; in the forest there is no comfort. The rivers issuing from the mountains are difficult to cross, the lions roaring in the mountain caves strike terror in the heart and render the forest perilous; therefore, remain here. O Sita, many wild beasts wandering at will in the forest may assail you, therefore life there is full of danger. The deep marshes and the rivers infested with crocodiles are difficult to cross, even an elephant may find them impassable. Many savage elephants wander here and there; assuredly the forest is replete with perils. Waterless are the paths covered with thorns and poisonous creepers, there the hoarse cry of wild fowl re-echoes; the forest is a source of suffering.

O Daughter of Mithila, fasting to the utmost extent, with matted locks, wearing robes of bark, one must constantly worship the devas and pittris and offer respectful hospitality to the unexpected guest. Thrice daily must ablutions be performed by those who live according to the prescribed ordinance, therefore, the forest is a source of suffering. O Youthful Princess, it is necessary to make offerings of flowers on the altars, plucked by one\u2019s own hand, as ordained by the sages. A dweller in the forest must be satisfied with whatever food he can obtain, therefore the forest is a source of suffering. Great storms visit the forest, covering it with darkness by day; constant hunger and many other perils prevail there, therefore is it a source of suffering. O Beautiful One, great snakes and pythons dwell in the forest, serpents as tortuous as the currents of the river live in the waters and obstruct the traveller\u2019s path, therefore the forest is a source of suffering. O Delicate Princess, scorpions, poisonous reptiles, hornets and mosquitoes afflict one constantly in the forest; therefore the forest is a source of suffering. O Charming Princess, the forest is filled with briars, harsh grass and gnarled trees obstructing the way, it is therefore a source of suffering. Life in the forest is full of conditions adverse to the body and manifold dangers, it is therefore a source of suffering. O Sita, a dweller in the forest must relinquish anger and avarice and practise severe penances, nor must fear visit him in the midst of alarms.", "\u201cDo not, therefore, consider entering the forest which is not meant to be your lot. Reflecting carefully, I see nought but suffering in the forest for you.\u201d", "Thus Rama disclosed his mind to Sita and sought to dissuade her from entering the forest, but the princess, sorely distressed, unable to consent to his counsel, then made answer.", "[Full title: Sita continues her entreaties but the prince is unwilling to consent to her departure].", "Shri Sita hearing Rama\u2019s words, was greatly distressed and with tears coursing down her cheeks, answered in a low voice:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, the sufferings of a life in the forest described by you, will, through my love for you be transmuted to joys. Deer, bear, lions, elephants, sarabhas, birds, bulls and other woodland beasts, on beholding your matchless countenance, will flee away stricken with terror. All fear you, O Lord! Instructed by my elders to remain in your company, it behoves me to go with you; separated from you, I cannot live. When near to you, O Rama, even Indra the King of the Devas dare not do me injury. O Rama, you have taught me that a woman must not be parted from her lord. O Most Wise Lord, long ago, in my father\u2019s house, I was told by one conversant with the movements of the planets that I should have to dwell in the forest. O Mighty One, since I was told by that brahmin skilled in occult sciences, of my life in the forest with you, I have looked forward to the time with joy. O, what felicity to live with you in the forest! O Dear One, you must grant me permission to go to the forest with you. I must go with you, it cannot be otherwise, thus shall I prove my fidelity, enjoined by my elders. The time for the fulfilment of the brahmin\u2019s prophecy is at hand. O Hero, I know all the miseries of life in the forest, but it is those of unsubdued mind who suffer them. While still living in my father\u2019s house, a pious and saintly woman predicted in the presence of my mother, that I should live in the forest. O My Lord, formerly I have begged you to let me sport with you in the woods. The time is now come, grant my prayer and let me go with you! O Prince, may the undertaking be propitious. Glad am I to accompany you to the forest, to serve you there will be my great delight. O Lord, relinquishing envy, accompanying you in the forest, all my sins will be washed away through my devotion to you. I have no other god but you, if death overtakes me I shall not experience happiness in the other world without you. I have heard from the brahmins that a woman given by her father according to the sacred ordinance to a man, becomes his wife in this world and also in the other world. O Prince of Beautiful Locks, in perfect devotion to you, filled with humility, regarding pain and pleasure as equal, sharing your austerities, permit me to accompany you. If you are still unwilling to take me, a woman distressed, to the forest, then I will seek death by poison or drowning.\u201d", "In this wise, Sita entreated Rama to let her accompany him, but still the great prince was unwilling to consent. Seeing Rama disinclined to grant her request, Sita was filled with grief, and her hot tears fell, moistening the earth. Shri Rama, seeing the princess flushed with anxiety and indignation still sought to divert her from her purpose.", "Shri Rama again stressed the dangers of the forest and sought to persuade Sita not to accompany him; but Sita, with fixed resolve, trembling with fear yet urged by love and pride, spoke as in jest: \u201cO Rama, if my father the Lord of Mithila, had known you as a man in form only, but a woman at heart, he would never have united me to you. Alas! that men in ignorance speak of Rama as resembling the sun in splendour, when in reality he is not so. O Rama, what makes you sad? Whence your fear that you, abandoning me who am devoted to you, should go to the forest? O Hero, know me to be to you what Savitri was to Satyavanta, the son of the valiant King Dyumatsena. O Sinless Prince, I have never looked on any, even in thought, but you, nor do I resemble those women dishonouring their family\u2019s name who look on other men; therefore, let me go with you.", "\u201cO Rama, why dost you desire to surrender me to Bharata, I, who, long resident with you, your youthful spouse, am solely devoted to you? Whether living as an ascetic or hermit or residing in heaven, I will follow you. Journeying in the forest will not weary me; by following you, I shall experience the same delight as walking in the gardens or sporting with you in the woods. O Rama, in your company the thorny briars such as kusha, sarpat and shara will seem to me as soft as deer skin. The dust raised by the storm, covering my body, will be as sandalpaste to me. I shall share with you the couch of grass with the same delight as a bed of silken down. What ever leaves, roots or fruits you dost bring for me will be as sweet and satisfying as ambrosia. Enjoying with you, the fruits and flowers of every season, I shall not call to mind my mother, father and home. No anxiety will be caused to you by my presence in the forest, neither shall my sustenance be a burden to you. I tell you the forest will be heaven in your company, and without you even the palace will be hell to me. Be pleased, therefore, to let me go to the forest with you. I fear nought in the forest, but if you still refiiseth to take me with you, then will I end my life by poison; never will I dwell among strangers. O My Lord, without you nothing is left to me but death; abandoned by you, it were better to die. I cannot endure the grief of your separation even for an hour, how then shall I suffer it for fourteen years?\u201d", "Thus Sita, lamenting and embracing Shri Rama, wept aloud. From her eyes, like a she elephant wounded by poisoned arrows, long-restrained tears issued, as fire is kindled by the friction of wood. Crystal drops fell from her eyes as water slips from the petals of the lotus flowers. The face of the princess resembling the full moon, withered by the fire of intense grief, looked like a lotus withdrawn from water.", "Shri Ramacandra, taking Sita, afflicted and fainting, in his arms, spoke to her in the following wise: \u201cO Devi, I do not desire even to enter heaven if it causes you pain! Nought do I fear! Like Brahma, I am wholly fearless! Though able to protect you in every way, yet not fully knowing your mind, I declined to let you share my exile. Seeing you are destined to share my exile, I do not desire to abandon you, as a man of virtuous conduct determines not to sacrifice his good name. O Beautiful One, following the example of the good of yore, I shall act in the same manner; do you follow me as Suvarchala follows the sun. O Daughter of King Janaka, I am not entering the forest by my own desire, but to obey the injunctions of my father. O Devi, it is the duty of a son to obey his parents, I could not endure life if I failed to observe my father\u2019s command. Fate is invisible, who can control it, but the parents and the spiritual preceptor are visible deities and their orders must be obeyed. What in the world is so sacred as the worship of that which grants dharma, prosperity and pleasure? By this worship, homage is paid to the three worlds. O Sita, observance of truth, charity and sacrifice accompanied by suitable offerings (dakshina) is of less avail in obtaining the spiritual realm than the service of parents and the Guru. Those who serve their parents and the spiritual preceptor obtain heaven, wealth, learning and progeny and nothing is impossible for them. Those who are devoted to their parents and their Guru obtain entrance to heaven and the regions of the devas, the gandharvas and Brahma. This is eternal righteousness\u2014to obey the command of your parents, fixed in the practice of truth. O Sita, not knowing your mind, I advised you not to accompany me, but now seeing your fixed resolve I desire to take you with me. O Princess, whose eyes sparkle like wine, you are destined to be my companion, do you assist me in the performance of my duty. It is well that you didst desire to be with me in accordance with the custom of our forbears. O Sita, prepare to go into exile without delay; without you, even heaven does not please me. Bestow your jewels on the brahmins in charity and offer food to the poor; hasten, make no delay. Give to the brahmins, jewels, ornaments, rich apparel, whatever you possessest or is employed for my entertainment, all that is mine and thine, couches, coverlets, and vehicles give in charity to the brahmins and what remains distribute among the servants.\u201d", "Shri Sita, happy at the acquiescence of Prince Rama and knowing her departure to be fixed, began to distribute all her possessions. Free from anxiety, Sita bestowed on the pious brahmins her wealth and all her jewels.", "Shri Lakshmana being present, hearing the converse of Rama and Sita, was afflicted and unable to restrain his grief, and weeping bitterly, spoke as follows: \u201cIf you are resolved to enter the forest in which dwell many wild beasts and elephants, I will accompany you with my bow and arrows. I will wander with you in the beautiful forest to the delightful sounds of birds and deer abounding there. O Ramacandra, without you I do not care to dwell even in the region of the gods nor do I desire immortality or dominion over other abodes.\u201d", "Seeing Prince Lakshmana determined to accompany him to the forest, Shri Ramacandra sought to dissuade him, but Shri Lakshmana answered: \u201cO Brother, having already granted me permission to accompany you, why dost you now prohibit me? O Sinless One, I would fain know what prevents you from taking me with you; my mind is clouded with fears.\u201d", "Shri Ramacandra perceiving Lakshmana humbly standing before him ready to accompany him, said: \u201cO Lakshmana, you are most dear to me, virtuous, brave and constantly engaged in righteous deeds, you are as dear to me as my life. You are my younger brother, my servant and my friend. If I grant your request, who will protect the renowned Kaushalya and Sumitra in thine absence? O Brother, the king who granted their desires, as a cloud responds to the need of the earth, is still under the bondage of pleasure desire. When Kaikeyi, the daughter of King Ashvapatti, becomes the queen mother, she will not treat her rival consorts well. She will not heed the needs and comforts of Queen Kaushalya and Sumitra, nor will Bharata, governed by his mother, respect them. Therefore, O Lakshmana, remaining here, winning the king\u2019s favour, render Queen Kaushalya happy. O Brother, heed my instruction. O Knower of Dharma, acting thus, you will demonstrate your great devotion to me and also serve your mother and thereby earn great merit. O Lakshmana, reflecting on these words, follow my injunction. Bereft of us, our mothers cannot be happy.\u201d", "Rama having uttered these words, the eloquent Lakshmana replied in gentle accents: \u201cO Hero, Bharata will assuredly have due regard for the Queens Kaushalya and Sumitra. If Bharata, having obtained this mighty kingdom, through evil counsel and pride should not protect the queens, I will assuredly slay that wicked wretch. O Noble One, Mother Kaushalya can well command thousands like me. That illustrious queen can easily protect my mother and herself and countless others. Make me your humble attendant, there is no wrong in this. Thus shall my highest desire be accomplished and you shalt also find satisfaction. Armed with my bow and arrows, a spade and basket, gathering wild fruit and flowers, I shall precede you, pointing out the way. Each day, I shall provide you with ascetic\u2019s food, leaves and other suitable offerings. Do you, with the daughter of the King of Videha, enjoy thyself on the mountain slopes. Sleeping or waking, I shall do all for you.\u201d", "Shri Ramacandra listened to the loving words of Shri Lakshmana with delight and answered: \u201cO Lakshmana, seek the permission of your mother Sumitra, and other relatives to go with me. O Lakshmana, fetch, without delay, the dread bows given by Varuna himself to Rajarishi Janaka at the time of the great sacrifice, also the impenetrable armour and the celestial quivers, the two swords bright as the sun, decorated with gold, which King Janaka presented to me at the time of my nuptials and which were deposited with care in the house of Shri Vasishta.\u201d", "Knowing his exile to be certain, Shri Lakshmana bade farewell to his relatives and, bringing the weapons decorated with fresh flowers from the home of Shri Vasishtha, presented them to Ram.", "Then Shri Ramacandra spoke joyfully to Lakshmana and said: \u201cO Handsome Prince, you are welcome at this hour, O Bi ther, I desire to offer all my substance in charity to the brahirins and ascetics, do you assist me. To those brahmins dwelling in the city devoted to their Guru, to them and to my servants distribute all my wealth. Summon the excellent Suyajna, the son of Shri Vasishtha, and bid him come here without delay. Having duly honoured him and other pious brahmins, I shall set out for the forest.\u201d", "[Full title: Shri Rama bestows his wealth upon the brahmins, his friends and servants].", "Commanded by Shri Rama, Lakshmana went to the house of the Rishi Suyajna. Beholding the rishi seated in his sacrificial pavilion, he made obeisance to him and said: \u201cRenouncing the kingdom, Shri Ramacandra is entering the forest, come in all haste to see him embark on this arduous undertaking.\u201d", "Having performed his evening devotion, the Rishi Suyajna, in company with Prince Lakshmana, entered the beautifiil and enchanting palace of Shri Rama. Perceiving this knower of the Veda to have come, Shri Rama and Sita rose and with joined palms welcomed the rishi with reverence. Offering him salutations, Shri Rama bestowed on him alms, beautiful ornaments, jewelled earrings, necklaces of precious gems strung on golden thread, amulets and other jewels, and at Sita\u2019s instance, said: \u201cO Peaceful Rishi, be gracious enough to accept this necklace and gold which Shri Sita offers to your spouse, also the bracelets and rings of beaten gold and jewelled bangles; about to enter the forest, Shri Sita offers them to your wife. Accept also this soft pure couch with a coverlet embroidered with precious stones, pearls and tassels. This elephant also, named Shatranjaya, which my uncle gave me, I present to you, O Great Rishi, together with a thousand golden coins.\u201d", "Suyajna, requested by Shri Rama, accepted all the gifts, and gave his blessings to Rama, Lakshmana and Sita. Then Rama, ever of sweet speech, addressed Lakshmana as Brahma addresses Indra, saying: \u201cO Lakshmana, call hither the two excellent sons of the Rishi Agastya and Shri Vishvamitra, and honour them with gifts of gems. Give to each in abundance as a field of corn is visited by rain, a thousand cows, gold, silver, jewels and ornaments. To that brahmin, versed in the Taittirya who daily, with devotion, gives his blessing to Queen Kaushalya and Sumitra, who is learned in the Vedanta and experienced in all matters, give vehicles, silken robes and women attendants, so that he may be wholly satisfied. To my confidential adviser, Citaratha, who has served me over a long period, give precious jewels, cloths and abundant wealth, and to the brahmacaris, my fellow students who study the Veda and are of excellent conduct, following no profession, living detached, enjoying good food, yet dependent on alms, give to each of these a thousand cows. O Lakshmana, bestow on them eighty camels apiece loaded with jewels, a thousand bullocks loaded with rice and two hundred bulls for tilling the ground. O Lakshmana, give them cows so that they may enjoy butter, milk and curds, and to each of the brahmacaris attending on Queen Kaushalya give a thousand cows and a thousand golden coins and give them abundant alms so that my mother may be pleased with us.\u201d", "Obeying the commands of Prince Rama, Shri Lakshmana offered hospitality to the brahmins. Like Kuvera, he gave to every brahmin abundant wealth as instructed by his brother. Then Shri Rama, seeing his servants standing near him weeping, bestowed on them sufficient wealth for their entire lives and said: \u201cUntil I return from the forest, keep watch on the palace belonging to Shri Lakshmana and myself.\u201d", "Then all wept overcome at the thought of his departure, and Rama turning to his treasurer said: \u201cBring hither my wealth,\u201d and they heaped quantities of gold and silver before him, wonderfill to behold. Then Rama with the aid of Lakshmana distributed it among the aged, the sick and the needy.", "Now, there was a certain brahmin of the family of Garga, whose name was Trijata, whose complexion was pale on account of much privation. He, toiling honestly, went to the forest daily with spade, axe and plough, maintaining his family on the fruits and flowers of the forest. His wife, worn down with much poverty, gathering her young children together, addressed her husband, saying: \u201cAbandoning your plough and spade, follow my instructions. Go with all speed and approach the virtuous Shri Ramacandra, undoubtedly you shalt obtain something there.\u201d", "The brahmin, covering himself with a few wretched rags, set out for Shri Rama\u2019s palace, his countenance, in lustre, resembling that of the Rishi Bhrigu or Angiras.", "Entering the fifth gate unchallenged, he came to where the multitude were assembled and approaching Shri Ramacandra, said: \u201cO Illustrious Prince, I am destitute of wealth and having many children, subsist on what I find in the forest, look upon me with compassion.\u201d", "Shri Rama answered jestingly: \u201cI have still many thousand cows not yet bestowed on any. Casting your staff from this spot, I will bestow on you as many cows as can stand in the space between you and where the staff has fallen.\u201d", "Trijata, hearing these words, binding his rags firmly about his waist, twirling his staff, threw it away with all his might. The staff fell on the further bank of the river Sarayu where thousands of royal cows and bulls were grazing. Shri Rama ordered all these to be driven to the brahmin\u2019s hermitage and thus addressed him: \u201cBe not displeased, O Brahmin, that I jested with you; I desired to test your great powers. Now, the cattle will be driven to thine abode, ask further whatsoever you desirest. O Brahmin, I will bestow anything you asks on you; all my wealth is to be given to the brahmins. Nothing so pleases me as the bestowal of my wealth on brahmins such as you, bringing me renown.\u201d", "Then the brahmin Trijata highly gratified, taking the cows, departed with his wife, full of power, renown and devotion, blessing Shri Ramacandra.", "Thereafter, Rama bestowed the remainder of his wealth, acquired through virtue, upon his friends, honouring them with marks of respect. There was not a brahmin, servant, pauper or beggar that he did not honour with charity at that time.", "Shri Rama, having with Sita, distributed riches in abundance to the brahmins in charity, went with Lakshmana and Sita to see King Dasaratha, followed by their servants bearing weapons adorned with flowers and sandalwood.", "The people of the capital mounting to the top of high buildings and the roofs of seven-storied houses to view them, were dispirited. Some said: \u201cBehold now Shri Rama, formerly attended by four divisions of the army, is to-day only followed by Sita and Lakshmana.\u201d Others answered, \u201cShri Rama, having tasted the delights of sovereignty and experienced in all the joys of life, he who confers wealth on the needy, prompted by duty, desires to render fruitful the promise of his sire. To-day, Sita never beheld before even by the birds, is exposed to the view of the common people on the highway.\u201d", "One said: \u201cSurely, the king is possessed of an evil spirit or he would never send so dear a son into exile.\u201d And another, \u201cNone ever banished even a traitor, how much less Shri Rama who has won the affection of the whole world by his excellent conduct? He is not only virtuous but is innocent, compassionate, learned, truthful, self-controlled and of subdued mind. His subjects are as distressed at the thought of his absence as the water-fowl during the summer drought. The sufferings of Rama, Lord of the world, afflict all, as does a tree uprooted from the earth. The glorious Ramacandra, knower of dharma, resembles the root of a tree of which the flowers, fruit, leaves and branches are the people. Let us, abandoning our gardens, fields and homes, sharing his woes, follow Shri Rama. Our houses deserted, their treasure removed, their courtyards neglected, without grain or stores, their beauty gone, will be buried in dust. The devas will no longer visit them, but mice scurrying hither and thither will fill them with countless holes. Without water, covered with soot, uncleansed, no daily rites will be performed there. Fallen in ruins, strewn with broken vessels, as if cursed by the king or by divine decree, all these, utterly forsaken by us, let Kaikeyi enjoy.", "\u201cWe pray that this city abandoned by Shri Rama may be converted into a wilderness and the forest where Rama dwells become a flourishing city. May the snakes forsake their holes, the deer and birds abandon their abode in the mountains and valleys, and the lion and elephant leave the forest, in fear of us and come and dwell in the capital of Ayodhya. May the city abandoned by us, bereft of hay and grain having become the resort of serpents, deer and birds, be ruled by Kaikeyi and her son and may we, dwelling in the forest with Rama, enjoy fully every happiness.\u201d", "Shri Rama passing by, hearing their converse, was not in any way disturbed, but proceeding slowly, like a young elephant, with majestic stride approached the palace of his father which resembled the Meru mountain. Shri Rama entering the royal palace guarded by seasoned troops, beheld Sumantra standing there disconsolate. Shri Rama, with a smiling countenance, passing the people who were afflicted and filled with grief, approached his father\u2019s apartment, desirous of serving him.", "Before entering the royal chamber, he requested Sumantra, dejected on account of Rama\u2019s departure, to inform the king of his arrival. Desirous of fulfilling the command of the virtuous monarch, Shri Rama, determined to enter the forest, requested Sumantra to make known his presence to the king.", "[Full title: The king gives his blessing while the whole palace is filled with lamentation].", "The dark-complexioned, lotus-eyed Ramacandra, that peerless prince, instructed his minister to announce his arrival to the Icing. On this, Sumantra entering the royal apartment, beheld the king sorely distressed, lamenting bitterly, like the sun under eclipse or a fire buried in ashes or a lake without water.", "The learned Sumantra with joined palms, addressed the sorely grieving monarch by praising him in a fitting manner and offering obeisance, he said: \u201cJai to you, O King.\u201d Then, falteringly, in low and gentle accents he added: \u201cO King, your son Rama, that Lion among men, is at your door, having distributed his whole wealth to the pious brahmins and servants; now having taken leave of his friends, he wishes to approach you. Clothed with every excellent quality as the sun with its rays, he is about to depart for the forest, be pleased to receive him, O Sire.\u201d", "The virtuous monarch, the knower of dharma, profound as the sea, pure as the sky, spoke: \u201cO Sumantra, summon the ladies of the court, I wish to see Rama in their presence.\u201d", "Entering the private apartments of the queens, Sumantra said: \u201cHis majesty demands your presence, go to him without delay.\u201d Thus addressed by Sumantra, in obedience to the wishes of their consort, they prepared to approach the king. Three hundred and fifty women, their eyes reddened with weeping on account of Rama\u2019s departure, surrounding Queen Kaushalya, slowly advanced towards the king. They being present, the king commanded Sumantra to bring his son before him.", "Sumantra bringing Shri Rama, Lakshmana and Sita with him, speedily entered the apartment of the king. The monarch beholding Shri Rama approaching, rose from his seat, and ran towards him in haste, with his consorts, but ere he reached him fell senseless to the earth.", "Then Shri Rama and Lakshmana advancing, lifted up the king who had been rendered unconscious by grief and suffering. The palace resounded with the lamentations of a thousand women crying, \u201cRama, Rama\u201d, \u201cAlas! Alas!\u201d the tinkling of their ornaments, drowned in the tumult of their cries.", "Shri Rama and Lakshmana supporting the king in their arms, conveyed him to the couch, and after a long time, he revived. Then Shri Ramacandra addressed the monarch who was sinking in the ocean of grief, and said: \u201cO Great King, Master of All, I am about to enter the Dandaka forest, be gracious enough to look on me with favour. Grant also that Lakshmana and Sita accompany me, since they, setting aside my counsel that they should remain here, have with fixed purpose, resolved to follow me. O Sire, giving up grief, command us, as Prajapati commands his subjects.\u201d", "His eyes filled with compassion, fixing his gaze on his beloved son, the king, knowing him to be about to enter the forest with a serene heart, said: \u201cO Ramacandra, I have been deceived by Queen Kaikeyi by reason of a promise, do you, setting me aside, seize the kingdom of Ayodhya by force.\u201d", "Hearing the king\u2019s words, Rama, eminent in virtue, spoke eloquently and humbly: \u201cMy Lord, may God grant you yet a thousand years to live and rule the earth 1 Desirous of following truth, I shall assuredly enter the forest, dwelling there fourteen years. I shall then return to serve you and offer you homage.\u201d", "Held fast in the toils of truth, the king, urged on by Kaikeyi, wept and full of distress, answered: \u201cO Child, to attain felicity in the other world and renown on earth and for the sake of your return, enter the forest with a peaceful heart. May no fear from any source visit you on the way. O Ramacandra, firm in truth and in the performance of duty, none can divert you from the path of righteousness. O My Son, do not yet depart, stay one more night with your mother and me. Satisfied after the night, early in the morning, do you set out for the forest. My Child, for my sake, you have undertaken that which none can accomplish. For my good and my future happiness, you have chosen to enter the forest. O Child, in truth, I cannot suffer your departure but am helpless. Deceived by Kaikeyi, whose designs resemble a fire covered with ashes, I am caught in this snare, but why must you also suffer? O Child, what wonder that you, my eldest son, should desire your father to uphold the truth.\u201d", "Hearing the words of his afflicted parent, Shri Rama, deeply distressed, answered: \u201cO Father, if to-day I should remain happily in the royal palace, what of to-morrow? Therefore, with your permission, I would fain leave at once. Let your kingdom, filled with wealth and grain, inhabited by your subjects, surrounded by tributary states, be given to Prince Bharata! O Giver of Boons, my resolution to enter the forest is fixed. Thus hast you ordained! I shall reside in the forest for fourteen years with the ascetics. Do you, without delay, give the kingdom to Bharata! I desire nought, nor is happiness as dear to me as obedience to your commands. O My Father, do not grieve, nor be distressed; the mighty ocean, Lord of the Rivers, does not overstep its bounds. O Sire, I desire neither kingdom nor pleasure, nor even Janaki, nor delight, nor heaven, nor life itself, but only wish to see you the votary of truth. O My Father, you are as a god to me, I vow by the truth and the merits acquired by me that my words are free from the taint of hypocrisy. O My Father and Lord, I cannot remain here a moment longer; restrain your grief, nothing can move me from my resolve. When Kaikeyi commanded me to enter the forest, I answered \u201cI will go\u201d, therefore, true to my word, I shall depart. Do not be distressed, O My Lord, I shall live in the forest where peaceful deer abound and birds sing their beautiful lays. O Father, a father is said to be the god of gods; knowing you to be a supreme deity, I am obedient to your behests. O August King, I shall easily pass fourteen years in the forest and then return to you. Now it becomes you to pacify those afflicted and sorrowful. O Lion among men, fulfil your duty and do not fall a victim to grief. I renounce the capital the kingdom and the earth; let them be given to Bharata. Without hesitation I shall follow your command and enter the forest. Let this kingdom adorned by high mountains and deep forests, filled with cities and villages, be ruled by Prince Bharata according to dharma. Let your word be fulfilled. O King, my heart is not given to delights nor to any object of pleasure, all I desire is to carry out your commands, approved by virtuous men. O King, give up all sorrow for my sake; I neither desire happiness nor wealth, nor the earth, nor Janaki, nay not even life. I desire the world to know you as the votary of truth. O My Lord, be happy. I, entering the forest filled with many kinds of trees, viewing the mountains and rivers, shall dwell joyfully, living on fruits and roots.\u201d", "The king filled with anguish, embraced his son and fell senseless to the earth.

Then the aged Sumantra also fell unconscious and the whole palace was filled with lamentation.", "Coming to his senses, the minister Sumantra, overcome with anger, breathing heavily, grinding his teeth, wringing his hands, beating his head, his eyes growing red, his colour altered, showed every sign of distress. Perceiving the Queen Kaikeyi to have forfeited the king\u2019s regard, Sumantra pierced her heart with words as keen as arrows, causing her to tremble. Penetrating to the most vulnerable parts of her being, Sumantra exposed the hidden defects of the queen by his barbed words.", "He said: \u201cO Lady, you have abandoned your husband the nourisher and supporter of the movable and immovable. There is nought undesirable in the world that you have not accomplished. I consider you the murderess of your husband and the destroyer of your family. By your vile deeds, you have smitten King Dasaratha, who is unconquerable, who resembles Indra and who is immovable as a mountain. O Kaikeyi, do not insult the aged king who has conferred these boons upon you. Obedience to her husband should, in a woman, far exceed the love of a thousand sons. It is the ancient tradition of this dynasty, that the eldest son succeed his father, but you seeks to revoke it and make your son ruler while the aged king still lives. Let your son Bharata rule the kingdom, we will follow Rama wheresoever he goes. No one of good report will remain to help your son in the administration, since you seeks to repudiate the immemorial usage. I wonder the earth does not open and swallow you for your misdeeds. Why do the holy sages not condemn you utterly? What fool cuts at the root of a sweet mango tree with his axe in order to plant a nimba tree in its place, which does not bear sweet fruit even if watered with milk. It is a common saying that honey does not flow from the nimba tree. I perceive you to be as wicked as your mother.

If you were dead, you couldst not insult me with your laughter\u2019.\u201d", "The king approaching the Yogi, told him the whole story, and the Yogi said: \u201cO King, let your wife return to the house of her father or die, do not you reveal the secret to her.\u201d Then King Kaikeya with a contented mind abandoned your mother, and lived free like Kuvera. O Sinful Queen, you also follows the evil path, deceiving the king and urging him to evil ways.", "It is a true saying", "\u2018The son follows the father and the daughter the mother\u2019.", "Do not follow your mother, but obey your husband, the king, our protector, by regarding his word. Cease to be ruled by evil and do not lead your husband into the way of unrighteousness. The king will not rescind the promise made to you. O Lady, entreat the king to bestow the crown on Rama who is the eldest son, who is generous, virtuous, a fulfiller of his duty, and a protector of all living beings. If Shri Rama goes to the forest, the whole world will speak ill of you. Let your mind be at peace and let Rama be crowned. If any other than Rama rule the kingdom, it will not profit you. If Rama becomes regent, then the king following the ancient tradition wjll doubtless retire to the forest.\u201d", "Thus did Sumantra with harsh words arraign the queen in the assembly, but Kaikeyi was in no wise moved, neither did she show any sign of repentance, nor did her countenance change.", "Then King Dasaratha, deeply distressed on account of his vow, addressed the weeping Sumantra, saying: \u201cO Sumantra, prepare four divisions of the army laden with wealth to accompany Shri Rama. Let beautiful and eloquent women and merchants follow in his train, together with rich traders who can set up stores stocked with those things necessary for the army of Shri Rama. Let those personal attendants pleasing to Rama, having received abundant wealth, accompany him. Let chosen citizens accompany Rama with instruments of war and vehicles, and those who know the forest paths, go also. Shri Rama hunting the deer and elephants, drinking fresh honey and enjoying the beauty of the rivers will call those left behind to remembrance. Let all my wealth and grain be sent with Rama to the uninhabited forest. Observing sacrifices with the sages in sacred places, bestowing alms upon them, Shri Rama will dwell there happily. Prince Bharata will govern the people here and Rama set out abundantly provided.\u201d", "Kaikeyi was seized with fear on hearing the words of the king, her mouth dried up and she was unable to speak. Trembling with agitation, she then said: \u201cO Chief of men, Bharata will not accept the kingdom stripped of its wealth and people, resembling unfermented wine.\u201d", "The eyes of the king reddened with anger at the cruel and shameless words of Kaikeyi, and he replied: \u201cO Wicked Wretch, why dost you seek to crush me with this load of sorrow? When you didst demand Rama\u2019s exile, you didst not add he should go empty handed?\u201d", "At the king\u2019s words, the fury of Kaikeyi was redoubled, and she said: \u201cOf your dynasty, King Sagara sent his son Asumanjas into exile. Let Rama depart in the same manner.\u201d", "At these words, King Dasaratha cried, \u201cWoe, alas!\u201d and all the people felt ashamed, but Kaikeyi remained unmoved. Then the chief minister, Siddhartha by name, a virtuous man, much favoured by King Dasaratha, addressed Kaikeyi, saying: \u201cO Lady, Asumanjas, seizing the children playing in the street, threw them into the river Sarayu, for this he was considered an exceedingly wicked man.", "The people of the city, disgusted with his cruel deeds, entreated King Sagara to banish him, saying:", "\u2018Will you preserve us or Prince Asumanjas in the city?\u2019", "King Sagara enquired of them the cause of their fear and they said in reply:", "\u2018Prince Ansumanjas has become insane, catching our children while at play and throwing them into the river; he rejoices in this act.\u2019", "King Sagara, therefore, abandoned his malevolent son and placing him on a carriage with his wife, clothing and other necessities, proclaimed:", "\u2018Asumanjas is banished for life.\u2019", "Asumanjas, armed with an axe and basket, wandered about in the forest and reaped the fruit of his evil deeds. The righteous Maharajah Sagara banished his son on account of his evil conduct but, O Queen, what wrong has Rama done that he should be exiled by you? I see no fault in Rama. It were as easy to find a taint in the moon! O Lady, if you have found any fault with Rama, then declare it openly and he will be banished from the kingdom. O Kaikeyi, it is an unrighteous act to abandon one following the path of virtue, without substantial reason; such an act would destroy the splendour of Indra himself. O Lady of Beautiful Countenance, do not destroy the prosperity of Shri Ramacandra and become a source of ignominy to the people.\u201d Hearing the words of the minister Siddhartha, King Dasaratha, overcome with grief, spoke to Kaikeyi, in broken accents and said: \u201cO Sinful One, dost you disregard the words of my minister? Art you blind to thine own welfare and mine? Art you determined to follow the evil path? Giving up my wealth and substance and the comforts of the palace, I will follow Rama. Do you rule at ease with Bharata for ever.\u201d", "[Full title: Despite the instruction of Vasishtha, Shri Sita still desires to enter the forest].", "Hearing the words of the chief minister Siddhartha and those of the king, the gentle prince humbly made the following reply: \u201cO King, having renounced all pleasures to live on the products of the forest, what need have I for wealth, an army or other requisites? Who will concern himself with the ropes binding the howdah to the elephant when he has parted with the elephant? O Great One, such am I, what occasion have I for an army in the forest? Let it be given to Prince Bharata. Bring me garments of bark. I go to pass fourteen years in the forest, and need but a spade to dig for roots and fruit and a creel and basket. I wish to start without further delay.\u201d", "Hearing his words, Kaikeyi rose up and brought the robes of bark, and in the midst of the assembly without shame, addressed Prince Rama saying: \u201cPut them on.\u201d", "Shri Ramacandra receiving the raiment from Kaikeyi, discarding his rich apparel, put on the dress of bark. Shri Lakshmana also putting off his beautiful robes, put on the dress of an ascetic in the presence of his father. Shri Sita dressed in a lovely silken sari, seeing the robes of bark proffered her, was startled, like a doe at the sight of the fowler\u2019s snare.", "The Princess Janaki, endowed with excellent qualities, received the bark dress, in shame and distress. Versed in the duties of a faithful spouse, she, addressing her god-like husband, her eyes suffused with tears, said: \u201cHow do the ascetics put on the robes of bark?\u201d", "Shri Sita, ignorant of the custom, remained confused. Unskilled in the art of wearing robes of bark, putting one end of the vestment round her neck and holding the other in her hands, she stood perplexed. Then Ramacandra, chief of the good, approaching the princess, fastened the robe of bark over her silken sari. All the ladies of the court, perceiving Rama assisting Sita in putting on the dress of bark, began to weep and timidly addressed the illustrious Rama: \u201cO Beloved Prince, your father has not granted Shri Sita permission to enter the forest. Do you enter the forest in accordance with the king\u2019s behest, but let not Janaki go with you. Let our life be fruitful beholding her face. Let Lakshmana go with you for your protection, but the beautiful Sita is not fitted to dwell in the forest like an ascetic. O Rama, prompted by dharma, go without delay as you desirest but, we entreat you, leave Princess Sita with us.\u201d", "Shri Rama, knowing that Sita was not willing to stay there in his absence, disregarding the request, helped Sita to don the bark raiment. Shri Vasishtha, the king\u2019s preceptor, seeing Sita attired in the habit of an ascetic, was displeased, and said to Kaikeyi: \u201cO Destroyer of your Dynasty, O Evil-minded Kaikeyi, you have deceived the king and now exceed the boons granted to you, you are dead to all good sense. It is not for Princess Sita to enter the forest, let her rule in the place of Rama till he return. The wife is, as it were, half of her spouse, therefore, what is his due is hers also. Shri Sita being the half of Shri Rama is in his absence entitled to the throne. Should Shri Sita accompany Rama, then I and all the people of Ayodhya will follow him. Where Rama goes with Sita, there will follow the guards, the people of the kingdom and the citizens of the capital. Yea, even Prince Bharata and Prince Shatraghuna, assuming the robes of ascetics will accompany their elder brother. Then this kingdom abandoned by men, peopled by trees alone, will be governed by you, O You, bent on the destruction of your subjects. Know well, that is no kingdom where Shri Rama is not king, but the forest in which Rama dwells becomes the kingdom. The king unwillingly consenting, may bestow the kingdom on Bharata, but Bharata will never accept the crown, nor will he honour you as his mother, if he be the true son of King Dasaratha. Even if you should die, yet will Prince Bharata, acquainted with the ancient law, refuse to rule the kingdom as long as his elder brother, Shri Ramacandra lives. You, desiring the advancement of your son, Bharata, seeking to make him king, art in reality bringing him to grief, since all will follow Shri Ramacandra. O Kaikeyi, you shalt see beasts, snakes, deer, birds and even trees, bend before Rama, swayed by his love, not to speak of men. O Lady, remove the dress of bark and let Sita be attired in royal robes, the ascetic\u2019s garb ill befits her.\u201d", "The Guru Vasishtha forbade Sita to don the robe of bark and said to the queen: \u201cO Daughter of the King Kaikeya, you have demanded the exile of Rama alone, let Sita be clad in royal robes when accompanying Rama. The boon exacted by you did not imply the exile of Shri Sita, therefore, let the princess, beautifully arrayed and adorned, enter the forest in a royal chariot.\u201d", "Despite the instruction of the resplendent sage, chief among the brahmins and the king\u2019s preceptor, Shri Sita, not relinquishing the ascetic\u2019s dress, desired to enter the forest, attired like her lord.", "Seeing Sita, like a widow though possessing a husband, putting on the habit of bark, all the people present condemned King Dasaratha. The king hearing their murmuring lost all interest in life, virtue and fame, formerly cherished by him. Sighing deeply, he said to his consort Kaikeyi:\u2014", "\u201cO Kaikeyi, it is unfitting for Sita to enter the forest wearing the habit of an ascetic. Our holy Guru Vasishtha has spoken truly. Sita is not fitted for life in the forest, that frail princess is worthy of perpetual happiness. Has the daughter of the great Emperor Janaka caused injury to any, that amidst the people she stands mute, dressed in a robe of bark, like an ascetic? I gave no promise that the daughter of King Janaka should put on the dress of a devotee. Let this princess enter the forest attired in an auspicious manner, with all her ornaments. My death is not far distant and my mind is in confusion; by promising these boons to you, I have been brought to nought. This act is consuming me as is the bamboo by its flowering. If it be said that Shri Rama has done you injury, O Sinful One, what harm did Janaki ever do to you? Of what dost you accuse the daughter of King Janaka, whose eyes resemble the gazelle\u2019s and who is meek and gentle.", "\u201cO Wicked One, by sending Rama without reason to the forest, you shalt assuredly enter hell; what else will not befall you on account of your evil deeds?", "\u201cWhen Shri Rama approached me on the eve of his installation, then didst you forbid him to inaugurate the ceremony and charged him to enter the forest with matted locks in an ascetic\u2019s garb. By my silence, I gave consent, but now, desirous of plunging thyself into hell you requirest Sita to enter the forest robed in the habit of a recluse.\u201d", "King Dasaratha, lamenting, saw no end to his distress. At length, helpless and overcome with grief, on account of his son, he fell to the ground.", "Shri Rama, his head bowed, ready to enter the forest, observing his father\u2019s distress, said: \u201cO King, my mother Kaushalya, devoted to her lord, aged and of a generous disposition, who never speaks ill of any, bereft of me will be drowned in a sea of sorrow. She who has hitherto known no suffering is now worthy of your special regard. O Father, you to whom honour is due, regard my mother with affectionate attention, that she may not suffer in the separation from her son and the bearing of many woes, but live dependent on you. O Emperor, equal to Indra in power, protect my mother in my absence that she may not languish and die.\u201d", "[Full title: As they prepare for departure the palace resounds with grief].", "Hearing the words of Rama and beholding him in the guise of an ascetic, the king lost consciousness and his consorts turned away in distress. Overcome with grief, the wretched monarch could neither look on Rama nor utter a word to him and for a space remained insensible. Then, regaining consciousness, the long-armed king, remembering Rama, began to lament: \u201cNow, without doubt, I know that in some previous birth, I separated many calves from their mothers and deprived many beings of their lives, on account of which all this has befallen me. The vital airs do not leave the body before the appointed time; though tormented by Kaikeyi, yet death does not claim me. Alas! I behold Shri Ramacandra, resplendent as fire, divested of his royal robes and attired in ascetic\u2019s garb. This evil caused by Kaikeyi, through guile and the desire for personal advantage is the source of universal distress.\u201d", "The king\u2019s eyes were suffused with tears and crying: \u201cRama, Rama,\u201d his throat choked, and he could utter no more. After some time, still shedding tears, he addressed Sumantra, saying: \u201cYoke the best steeds to the chariot and convey Shri Rama out of the city. Now it is made clear that a man\u2019s virtue leads him into affliction, since so wise and valiant a son is being banished by his parents.\u201d", "As instructed by the king, Sumantra yoked the most excellent of steeds to a richly decorated chariot and bringing the golden car with the best steeds yoked thereto, before the prince, said humbly: \u201cThe chariot is at hand.\u201d", "The king then summoned his upright and trustworthy treasurer and spoke to him in words suitable to the place and time: \u201cBring hither for Janaki, costly apparel and ornaments to serve the princess for fourteen years.\u201d As instructed by the king, the master of the treasury brought the various articles and delivered them to Princess Sita. The highly born Sita, attiring herself in a sumptuous robe and ornaments, made ready to depart for the forest. Thus attired, Shri Janaki illumined the palace as the rays of the rising sun illumine the sky.", "Queen Kaushalya embraced the princess of virtuous conduct to her bosom and blessing her said: \u201cThe world is filled with undutiful wives, who cease to regard their lord when he has fallen into distress. Such is the nature of those who having enjoyed great pleasures, on finding their consort involved in trouble, condemn and sometimes even abandon him. Many are the women, untruthful, heartless, unchaste, devious and vain, full of evil passions, the destroyers of long-honoured ties. Neither a worthy family nor duty, nor the instruction of the Guru, nor gifts, sway them, nor do they honour the marriage ties, their minds being fickle. But those women devoted to their husbands, of virtuous conduct, honouring the tradition of their family, truthful, following the instructions of their preceptor, regard their lord as the chief of men. Therefore, do not condemn my son, now ready to enter the forest, who should be regarded by you rather as a deity, whether in poverty or prosperity.\u201d", "Shri Sita, understanding the import of these words, inspired by dharma, humbly replied: O Noble Lady, I will fulfil your commands. It is known to me that a woman should serve her lord, and my parents have instructed me in the matter. Do not deem me a false woman. I am as unable to forsake the path of virtue as the sun\u2019s light the moon. As a lute is useless without strings, as a chariot cannot move without wheels, so is a wife bereft of her husband, even if she have a hundred sons.", "\u201cFather, mother or son can give but a small measure of happiness, but a husband is the source of limitless joy. What woman is so unworthy that she will not obey her husband? I am acquainted with all the duties of a wife, being instructed by those eminent in virtue. A husband is as a god to his consort, never shall I not honour him.\u201d", "The simple-hearted queen, shedding tears of distress on account of the separation from her son, hearing Princess Sita\u2019s words, was comforted.", "Then Rama said: \u201cO Mother, when I am in the forest, do not look on my father with a reproachful countenance, the term of my exile will soon be ended. The fourteen years will pass like a dream. Surrounded by my friends, you shalt behold me serving my sire.\u201d", "Speaking thus to his mother Kaushalya, Shri Rama reflected how to address the three hundred and fifty other consorts of the king. To these who were bitterly lamenting, he spoke with humility. \u201cWhile living amongst you, if I have ever, in ignorance, offended you, be gracious enough to pardon me.\u201d These pious and humble words of Rama, inspired by dharma, touched the hearts of the queens, causing them to shed tears and their lamentations resembled the sound of krouncha birds.", "The palace of the king, formerly resounding to the beating of drums resembling the crash of thunder, was to-day filled with the wailing of the sorrow-stricken queens.", "Shri Rama overcome with grief, touched the feet of his sovereign and bowing down, with Lakshmana and Sita, circumambulated the king. Having taken leave of his sire, Rama with Sita paid reverence to the sorrow-stricken Queen Kaushalya.", "Then Shri Lakshmana bowed before the Queen Kaushalya and embraced the feet of his mother Sumitra. His mother weeping, desiring her son\u2019s good, blessed Lakshmana and said: \u201cO My Son, Shri Rama was born of Queen Kaushalya for the protection of the world, and I have borne you so that, devoted to Shri Rama, you should accompany him to the forest. O My Son, do not neglect the service of Shri Rama. O Sinless One, whether in fortune or in adversity, regard him as your life! It is the duty of the good to be subject to their elders. The tradition of your dynasty is the giving of charity, the performance of sacrifice, death on the field of battle and implicit regard for thine elders.\u201d", "Speaking thus, Sumitra seeing Rama ready to depart for the forest, again and again exhorted Lakshmana in this wise: \u201cO My Son, enter the forest with Rama. O Child, have no anxiety, do not grieve either for your father, mother, home or country, esteem Rama to be Dasaratha, Janaki as myself and the forest equal to Ayodhya.\u201d", "Sumantra now addressed Rama with humility as Matali addresses Indra: \u201cO Illustrious Prince, be pleased to mount the chariot, I will take you wheresoever you desirest. Let the period of thine exile enjoined by Kaikeyi begin to-day.\u201d", "Then the beautiful daughter of King Janaka, adorned with the jewels, bestowed on her by the king, cheerfully mounted the waiting vehicle, which shone like the sun. Shri Rama and Lakshmana also swiftly ascended the chariot enriched with gold and weapons.", "Having regard to the period of exile, King Dasaratha had bestowed on his daughter-in-law, robes and jewels and ordered arms and mantra-charged weapons, armour and shields to be placed on the chariot. Seeing that all were mounted, Sumantra set the chariot in motion guiding the horses swift as the wind. Rama having started for the Dandaka forest, the whole city, young and old, men and women, soldiers, elephants and horses, distracted and full of indignation and distress, became as beings demented. The loosing of elephants, and the loud neighing of horses filled Ayodhya with tumult and ferment. Young and old, distraught, ran after the chariot of Rama as men overpowered by the sun plunge into water. Some running beside the royal car, some behind looking up towards Rama, others weeping and lamenting, cried to Sumantra: \u201cO Charioteer, drive slowly, draw in your steeds, so that we may see the face of Rama so soon to be hidden from us. Surely the heart of his mother must be made of steel that it did not break on seeing the godlike prince departing for the forest. Great indeed is Shri Sita, who follows her husband like a shadow, as the light of the sun that never forsakes the Meru mountain. O Lakshmana, perfect art you, constantly serving thine amiable and godlike brother. This is perfection, this is prosperity, thus to attend your brother is the way to heaven.\u201d", "Thus lamenting, following the chariot of Rama, the people could not restrain their tears. The afflicted and wretched monarch, King Dasaratha, overcome with grief, coming forth from the palace barefooted, surrounded by his queens, cried out: \u201cI must again behold my beloved son.\u201d Then he heard the lament of the women wailing like she elephants when their mates are bound in chains, and like the full moon in eclipse, King Dasaratha was bereft of his splendour.", "Shri Rama, free from anxiety, urged the charioteer on, saying: \u201cFaster! faster!\u201d and as he spoke, enjoining Sumantra to drive more speedily, the people cried, \u201cStay, stay\u201d, so that the charioteer knew not how to obey both commands. The dust raised by the wheels of Rama\u2019s chariot was laid by the tears of the people. As Shri Rama left the city, the people weeping and bewildered were distraught, the tears of the women falling like drops of water on lotus leaves, when fishes leap. The people following Rama\u2019s chariot and perceiving the anguish of the king, wept in sympathy. A great tumult now arose from the ladies of the palace and the king\u2019s attendants all weeping and crying, \u201cO Rama! O Kaushalya!\u201d and hearing the wailing and lamentation of the people Shri Rama looked back and beheld the king and his mother Kaushalya, barefooted, following his chariot, and was filled with sorrow. Shri Rama, bound by the cord of duty, turned his eyes from his parents, as a foal not permitted to follow its dam. Perceiving his royal parents, unacquainted with suffering, worthy of excellent chariots, running barefooted towards him, he said to Sumantra: \u201cDrive on speedily!\u201d unable to bear the sight of his parents\u2019 distress, as an elephant is unable to bear the goad. His mother Kaushalya trembling and tottering, ran towards him, like a cow hearing the cries of her calf that has been bound, crying, \u201cO Rama! O Sita! O Lakshmana!\u201d The king calling, \u201cStay! Stay!\u201d to the charioteer, with Rama crying, \u201cGo forward speedily\u201d, caused the heart of Sumantra to be riven, like one standing between two rival armies.", "On this, Rama addressed him, saying: \u201cOn your return to the palace, when charged by the king with disobeying his commands, do you say: \u2018Amidst the noise of the rolling wheels, I was unable to hear.\u2019 Further delay will prove calamitous.\u201d Shri Sumantra regarding the words of the prince, signalling the people following to return, urged the horses on.", "The chariot outstripping the king, caused him to halt with his household and mentally circumambulating Rama, he returned to the palace. The courtiers now said to the king: \u201cNone follows a friend far, whom he wishes to see return.\u201d King Dasaratha hearing this injunction, bathed in perspiration, utterly wretched, stood gazing at the receding chariot.", "That Lion among men, Prince Ramacandra, having in humility departed, a great cry of distress arose among the ladies of the inner apartment. They cried: \u201cWhere is Ramacandra, the only asylum and refuge of the orphaned, the weak and the suffering? Where is Prince Rama, who when provoked, showed no anger, who caused no agitation to any heart, who appeased those who were wrathful, and considered others\u2019 distress as his own? Where is that Rama now, who treated us with the same regard as he showed his illustrious mother, Queen Kaushalya? Where is he wandering now, that Rama, Protector of the World, who has gone to the forest, persecuted by Kaikeyi, and exiled by his father? O, how insensible the king has grown, that he has sent the virtuous and truthful Rama, the object of universal love, into exile.\u201d", "In this way, all the ladies of the court wept aloud like cows who have been bereft of their calves. The king overwhelmed with grief on account of separation from his son, suffered increasingly on hearing the loud and piteous cries of the ladies of the palace. On the prince\u2019s departure, no brahmacari performed the fire ceremony, no householder prepared food but passed the day in deep distress. The elephants cast off their trappings and the cows refused to nourish their calves, mothers showed no delight at the sight of their first-born.", "Trishanku, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus and other inauspicious planets gathered round the moon, pulsating there; the stars lost their brilliance and the planets their splendour. Vishaka, growing dim, was scarcely distinguishable in the sky. The clouds, driven by a strong wind, overtaking each other, resembled waves rising in the sea. When Shri Rama departed, an earthquake caused the city to tremble, the ten cardinal points were covered in darkness, neither were the planets nor the stars visible. All the inhabitants of the city were overwhelmed with misery, none partook of food that day or found pleasure in any pastime.", "All the people of Ayodhya, sighing heavily, were filled with sorrow and grieved for the king. Those walking in the streets wept and nowhere was there any sign of joy. No cool breezes blew, nor did the moon shine, the rays of the sun were weak and the whole world mourned for Rama. Sons gave no thought to their parents, husbands were indifferent to their wives and brothers showed no affection to each other; all were sunk in grief. The friends of Rama, unconscious of themselves and filled with distress, were bereft of sleep. Without Rama, Ayodhya resembled the earth with all its mountains, suffering from drought. Every household was consumed with grief and the cries of elephants, horses and warriors filled the city.", "So long as the dust raised by the wheels of Rama\u2019s chariot could be seen, so long did the king not withdraw his gaze from the way. So long as King Dasaratha could see his beloved and most virtuous son, Shri Ramacandra, so long did he stand gazing after him, and when the dust was no more visible, the wretched monarch, stricken with grief fell to the earth. Then Queen Kaushalya taking hold of his right hand and Queen Kaikeyi his left, ministered to him. The virtuous and upright king beholding Queen Kaikeyi near him, said: \u201cO Wicked Queen, touch me not, I do not desire to see your countenance. You are neither my consort, nor do I desire relationship with you; your servants are no longer my servants, nor am I their master. You, who hast abandoned obedience to your lord, I now repudiate. Your hand, accepted by me when circumambulating the sacred fire, I relinquish, and renounce the worldly and spiritual pledges given you in the ceremony. If Bharata, receiving this kingdom, is satisfied, then let him not perform my obsequies.\u201d", "Queen Kaushalya, torn with grief, raised the king, soiled with dust, and conveyed him to his chariot. The king sorely afflicted, remembering his son in ascetic\u2019s garb, resembled one who has murdered a brahmin or touches a blazing fire with his naked hand. Turning again and again towards the path that the chariot had taken, the king\u2019s countenance resembled the sun in eclipse. Conceiving his son Rama to have passed beyond the city boundary, and thinking of him, he again gave way to grief, crying: \u201cI see the marks of the hoofs of the horses that were yoked to the chariot of my son, but him I do not see. Alas! My Son, who perfumed with sandalpaste, slept on soft pillows, fanned by beautiful women, to-day sleeps beneath a tree with wood or stone for his pillow. In the morning, he will awake on the hard ground, his mind oppressed, his body smeared with dust, sighing deeply like a bull rising from beside a spring. The dwellers in the forest will behold Rama rising like an orphan and wandering as one forlorn. That daughter of King Janaka worthy of every happiness, her feet pierced with thorns, hearing the roar of animals like tigers, will be struck with terror; O Kaikeyi, your ambition is fulfilled, now rule the kingdom as a widow for I cannot support life without the chief of men.\u201d", "Thus lamenting, the king returned to the capital, like a man having cremated one supremely dear to him. He beheld courts and houses deserted, the markets forsaken and the temples closed, while on the royal highway only the feeble and afflicted were to be seen. Seeing the city desolate and remembering Shri Rama, weeping bitterly, the king entered the palace as the sun enters a cloud. As the presence of an eagle deprives a lake of its serpents, rendering it still, so did the capital appear when Shri Rama, Lakshmana and Sita had gone into exile.", "Then the king in distress, his throat choked with grief, spoke in faint and trembling accents: \u201cTake me speedily to the palace of Queen Kaushalya, the mother of Rama, nowhere else can I obtain peace.\u201d", "The attendants carried the king to the apartments of Queen Kaushalya and placed him on a couch, but the king\u2019s heart could find no rest; the palace without Rama, Lakshmana and Sita appeared to him like the sky bereft of the moon. Finding no delight there, the king lifting up his hands, cried: \u201cO My Son, O Rama, art you leaving me? How blessed are they who seeing Rama return, will embrace him.\u201d", "Finding the night dark, resembling the hour of death, the king at midnight thus addressed Kaushalya: \u201cO Kaushalya, I do not see you, my sight has followed Rama, nor has it yet returned, therefore, reach forth your hand and touch me, O Queen.\u201d", "Seeing her royal consort merged in the remembrance of Rama, the queen, sighing, seated herself by the king and began to lament in sympathy with him.", "Queen Kaushalya, deeply afflicted by the separation from her son, seeing the king lying on the couch merged in grief, said: \u201cO King, that evil Kaikeyi having discharged her poison on Shri Rama, will wander about at will, like a snake that has cast its slough. That sinful woman, having accomplished her design and sent Rama to the forest will ever inspire me with terror, like a venomous serpent in the home. If her demand had been that Rama should dwell in the city on alms or had she condemned him to be her slave, it were better than exile. She has cast out Rama, as the oblation offered to the asuras is cast away by those who tend the sacrificial fire. The long armed Rama, the wielder of the great bow, walking like the king of elephants, must by now have reached the forest with Sita and Lakshmana. O King, consider how your son Rama, who has never before experienced suffering, is banished by you, urged by Kaikeyi I O What fate will befall them now? Without wealth, exiled in his youth when a king\u2019s happiness should have been his portion, how will he be able to live on roots and berries in the forest? Will the time ever come when I shall see Rama, Lakshmana and Sita return, putting an end to my sorrow? When will that glad day dawn, when the illustrious capital filled with rejoicing crowds, decorated with flags, banners and garlands, welcomes Rama? O will that auspicious hour ever strike, when the citizens hearing of his return will be filled with gladness, like the sea at the time of the full moon? When will Shri Rama with Sita, enter the city, like the bull who, at dusk, preceding the herd of cows, returns to the town. When will the people of the capital, waiting to scatter rice over him, gather in thousands on the highways to welcome Rama, the subduer of his foes? O, when shall I see my sons, resplendent as two mountain peaks, return to Ayodhya, adorned with earrings, bearing the sword and scimitar. When will the two princes, circumambulating the city with Janaki, receive gifts of flowers and fruit from the hands of virgins and brahmins? When will the virtuous and sagacious Rama run towards me, leaping like a child? Surely my love pours forth for him, as the breasts of mothers when suckling their infants. O Great King, because of this, Kaikeyi has increased my love for my child; bereft of him, I am like a cow whose calf has been forcibly carried away by a lion. My only son Rama is versed in all the classics and endowed with every excellent quality; without such a son, I cannot live. O Great King, I cannot sustain life in the absence of my brave and beloved son; the fire of grief caused by the separation from my son is consuming me, as the rays of the sun in summer consume the surface of the earth.\u201d", "The righteous Queen Sumitra hearing the lament of Queen Kaushalya addressed her in reasonable words: \u201cO Queen, why dost you weep in abject fashion, for your son, the chief of men, endowed with every virtue? O Noble Lady, Shri Rama has renounced the throne and entered the forest to render his father illustrious, as the votary of truth. Shri Rama, honouring his father, has conducted himself as the best of men and secured the future glory of his sire. There is no cause for grief, since Rama is treading the path of dharma, neither is there cause to grieve for Lakshmana, ever compassionate to all, sinless, serving Rama and in every way worthy of the highest good. The tender-limbed Janaki, too, is following your virtuous son. O Queen, the exile of Rama is no cause for sorrow since he is the protector of all beings and the follower of virtue. O Queen, the banner of his good name waves over the three worlds. Consider the purity of Rama; even the sun dares not cause him suffering by its rays. In his presence, the hot winds of the forest in summer will grow cool and like the spring breeze bring him refreshment! When asleep in the forest at night, the moon, like a father, will succour him with its cool beams. That Ramacandra, to whom the Brahmarishi Vishvamitra gave celestial weapons on the death of his son Shambara, that valorous son, that lion among men, depending on the strength of his arms will dwell in the forest as fearlessly as in his own palace. That hero whose arrows destroy his foes, is certain to be succoured by the earth. That Rama, endowed with great prowess, power and courage, will soon return on the termination of his exile, to claim the kingdom. O Lady, Shri Rama, who illumines the sun which gives light to the whole world, who gives splendour to the fire, who is the supreme ruler of rulers, who is the fame of fame and the essence of forgiveness, who is the chief of beings; wherever he dwells, in the forest or the city, all is one to him. Shri Rama, this great hero, will speedily regain his kingdom, together with Sita, the earth and every prosperity. Shri Rama for whom, when departing for the forest, the people of Ayodhya filled with grief, shed tears, will soon regain the kingdom. Nought is difficult to obtain in the world by him, who, though invincible, entered the forest, dressed like an ascetic, followed by Sita, who is Lakshmi in another form.", "\u201cWhat should be difficult for him, who, armed with bow and sword, is preceded on his way by Lakshmana? O Lady, abandon grief and infatuation, assuredly you will behold Shri Rama returning from his exile. O You who art irreproachable, O Kalyani, O Auspicious One, you will behold your son like the rising moon, placing his head at your feet. You will shed tears of joy, seeing your son installed on the throne and in possession of the king\u2019s treasury. O Lady, neither grieve nor let your mind be troubled, I see nought that is inauspicious in respect of Rama. Soon you shalt behold your son with Sita and Lakshmana. O Sinless Queen, it becomes you to encourage others, therefore, why dost you now cause your heart distress? O Devi, do not grieve, there is none in the world more virtuous than Rama. Seeing Rama returning from the forest with his friends, making obeisance to you, then will you shed tears of joy, like the clouds in the rainy season. In brief, I tell you, your son Shri Rama, returning to the capital, will press your feet to him with his tender hands. Seeing your son bowing to your feet you will cover him with tears as the clouds cover the mountains with rain.\u201d", "Thus did the beautiful Sumitra, ever persuasive and benevolent to all, offer words of consolation to the Queen Kaushalya and having spoken, became silent. The chief queen, the mother of Shri Rama, hearing the words of Queen Sumitra, found peace and forgot her grief which resembled the rain of the autumn clouds that swiftly disappears.", "The people of the capital, deeply devoted to Shri Rama, the Upholder of Truth, followed him on his way to the forest. Though King Dasaratha, on the advice of his ministers, turned back, the citizens of Ayodhya continued to run beside the chariot of Rama. The inhabitants of the city were devoted to Rama whose virtues rendered him resplendent like the full moon, and weeping piteously, implored the holy prince to return, but Rama, determined to prove his father to be true to his word, pressed on towards the forest. They, looking on Rama as a thirsty man looks on water, were addressed by him with tender affection as a father addresses his children.", "He said: \u201cO You People of Ayodhya, for my sake bestow the love and honour shown to me, in even greater measure, on Bharata! Prince Bharata, who is of an excellent disposition, will assuredly deal benevolently with you and endear himself to you. Though young, he is wise, gentle and endowed with great courage. Warm-hearted and charitable, you will have no cause for fear on his accession to the throne. King Dasaratha has appointed him heir-apparent in consideration of his great virtue, we should therefore obey the king. When I am absent in the forest, you should so act towards him as to occasion him no distress. Do you, desirous of pleasing me, obey the king.\u201d", "Rama, instructing the people to obey the king again and again only increased their desire to see him as their sovereign. It appeared that Rama with Lakshmana drew the distressed and weeping inhabitants of the city after them as if bound by a cord.", "Among the elders in age, wisdom and austerity, the first, their heads trembling with advanced years, calling from a distance, said: \u201cO You Swift and Excellent Steeds, return, return, do not proceed further and favour Rama. All beings are endowed with perception, but you excel in the sense of hearing, therefore hear our entreaty and turn back. We know the heart of our master to be simple and gentle, we know him to be a hero firm in his vows, therefore, return to Ayodhya, do not carry Rama away from the city to the forest.\u201d", "Hearing the lament of the aged brahmins and perceiving their distress, Shri Rama, causing the chariot to halt, dismounted. With Lakshmana and Sita, he walked towards the forest, followed by the multitude, proceeding slowly on foot. The ever virtuous and compassionate Rama was unable to endure the sight of the aged brahmins walking on foot, far behind the chariot.", "The brahmins seeing Rama did not return, despite their supplications, but still proceeded towards the forest, were troubled and overcome with distress, cried: \u201cO Rama, you are a friend of the brahmins and the whole caste is following you with the sacred fire borne on their shoulders. See, we are carrying the holy canopies, like autumn clouds, obtained by us by observing the Vajapeya ceremony. By covering you with their shade, we will protect you from the rays of the sun. O Child, formerly your mind was set on the study of the Veda, but now you are determined to enter the forest. Our only wealth, the Veda, we have stored in our memory and our consorts are at home, protected by their conjugal devotion. There is no cause for further reflection, we are determined to go with you! If you dost not walk in the path of dharma, who will follow it?", "\u201cO Rama, what more can be said? We, whose heads are white like swan\u2019s down, offer humble salutations to you. Among us, some have entered upon their sacrifices, O Rama, their completion depends on you. Not we alone, but beasts, birds and trees, entreat you to return; have pity on all these. Trees desiring to follow you, prevented by their roots which penetrate deep into the earth, implore you not to depart, their branches bending low in the wind. See the birds, forgetting to seek their food, sit motionless on the trees, supplicating you who art compassionate to all.\u201d", "Thus lamenting, the brahmins beheld the river Tamasa as if obstructing the path of Rama, preventing his further progress.", "Then Sumantra, loosing the tired horses, let them roll on the ground to relieve their fatigue and gave them to drink causing them to bathe in the river, and allowing them to graze on the banks of the Tamasa.", "[Full title: Shri Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana and the charioteer drive on alone to the forest].", "Shri Rama, reaching the beautiful banks of the river Tamasa, gazing on Sita, addressed his brother Lakshmana: \u201cO Son of Queen Sumitra, this is the first night of our exile, there is no cause for anxiety. The forest looks deserted and melancholy, the birds and beasts having retired to rest. Doubtless the capital of Ayodhya with its inhabitants and my royal sire are deeply distressed on account of our departure. The king, seeing in us many virtues, looks on us with deep affection. O Lakshmana, I fear lest my father and my illustrious mother become blind with incessant weeping. Yet Prince Bharata of upright conduct, will assuredly offer consolation to my parents in dutiful and pious words. O Mighty-armed Prince, reflecting on the compassion of Prince Bharata, I have no fear for my parents. O Hero, you have done well in accompanying me to the forest, had it not been so, my solicitude for Sita would have been great. O Lakshmana, there is an abundance of roots, fruits and berries here, but to-night I desire to partake of water alone.\u201d", "Having thus addressed Prince Lakshmana, Shri Rama said to Sumantra: \u201cO Gentle Friend, attend to the horses with great care.\u201d The sun having set below the horizon, Sumantra, fastening the horses to a tree, placed tender grass before them, heedful of their welfare. The time of Sandhya having come, the charioteer observed his devotions according to the rules of his caste, then, with the help of Lakshmana, prepared a bed for Rama. Perceiving the bed made with tender leaves, on the banks of the Tamasa, Shri Rama with Sita and Lakshmana rested there.", "Finding Shri Rama and Siti sleeping, Lakshmana, leaving his seat, recounted the excellent virtues of Rama to the charioteer. Lakshmana thus passed the whole night till the sun rose, conversing with Sumantra on the attributes of Rama.", "In this manner, on the banks of the Tamasa, among herds of cattle, Shri Rama and those who had followed him, passed the night. At dawn, Shri Rama rose and seeing the people still asleep, said to his virtuous brother Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cO Lakshmana, see how these people, abandoning their homes and property, to follow us, are sleeping under the trees. It seems that they, vowing to bring us back, will give up their lives rather than be false to their determination. Let us, therefore, O Brother, leave this place before they wake. When we have crossed the Tamasa, there will be no further cause for anxiety. By our silent departure, the people of the capital of King Ikshvaku, will not, like us, be compelled to sleep under the trees. It is the duty of a prince to preserve them from suffering and not make them the companions of his distress.\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana answered Ramacandra, saying: \u201cO Wise One, I accept your resolve, let us mount the chariot immediately.\u201d", "Rama then said to Sumantra: \u201cSpeedily prepare the chariot, I will proceed towards the forest, let us therefore depart from hence without delay.\u201d", "The charioteer, hastily yoking the horses to the chariot, humbly addressed Rama, saying: \u201cO Great Prince, the chariot is now ready, please ascend with Lakshmana and Sita; may prosperity attend you.\u201d", "Shri Rama with his bow, quiver and other weapons, mounted the chariot and passed over the swiftly flowing river. Crossing the Tamasa, at a short distance from the shore, they traversed a rugged path overgrown with briars, and then came to a wide road, where they could travel with ease and which was safe from any danger. To elude the citizens, Shri Rama said to Sumantra: \u201cO Charioteer, drive first towards the south. Having thus driven for a space, return again, so that no trace of us may be found.\u201d", "Shri Sumantra, following the instructions of Rama, drove forward, then returning, stood before Rama. The son of Dasaratha, the augmenter of the glory of the house of Raghu, spoke from the chariot, saying: \u201cNow drive towards Tapovana.\u201d", "Sumantra, turning the chariot towards the north, proceeded in the direction of the forest.", "The night being over and the day having dawned, the citizens awoke and not beholding Rama, were overwhelmed with grief, not knowing how to act. Seeking here and there, their eyes bathed in tears, they were unable to discover by what path Shri Rama had departed. Wretched and pale with distress, with quivering hearts and utterly dispirited, they broke into piteous exclamations, saying:\u2014", "\u201cCursed be the sleep that veiled our perceptions, now we shall not behold the full chested and large-eyed Rama. How fruitless is our devotion, since Rama has gone to the forest leaving us, his faithful friends, here. Why has Rama who ever treated us as his children, left us to enter the forest? Either we will find death here or go to the Himalayas and perish in the snow. What avails life without Rama? Here is dried wood, let us collect it and kindling a fire, perish in the flames. What shall we say on our return? Shall we tell others we have abandoned the mighty armed Rama, who is free from envy and a votary of truth? Alas 1 we cannot do so. The wretched city with the women, the aged and the children, seeing us return without Rama, will be plunged in grief. Having abandoned our homes to follow that self-controlled prince, how can we venture to face the people without him?\u201d", "Thus lamenting, with uplifted arms, filled with distress, they resembled cows bereft of their young. ( Following the track of the chariot wheels, they pressed forward, till, losing their trace, they became prostrate with grief. Finding no further path to follow, they turned back crying: \u201cAlas! what shall we do? Fate is against us!\u201d Then, by the way by which they had come, they retraced their steps to Ayodhya.", "Shri Rama, failing to return, the people became restless, and seeing the capital cheerless, despondent and sorrow-stricken, they wept, murmuring to each other: \u201cThe city, bereft of Rama, has no beauty, it resembles a dried-up river, divested of its snakes by an eagle.\u201d As the sky without the moon or the sea without water, so did the city appear to the people, causing their hearts to faint within them.", "Sadly entering their magnificent dwellings, afflicted and distraught, they were unable to distinguish one of their own relatives from a stranger.", "Thus afflicted, the people of the capital, their eyes streaming with tears, longed to give up their lives. Having followed Rama to the forest, they became melancholy and appeared to be almost lifeless. In their homes, with their wives and sons, they lamented bitterly. None rejoiced, none were cheerful, none decked out their children to advantage, nor did the women adorn themselves; no fire burnt on the hearth of any home, none was glad to recover the wealth he had lost and none rejoiced at a sudden increase of riches. Mothers found no delight in the return of their first-born after a long absence. Every house was filled with wailing; the husbands returning without Rama were upbraided by their wives with bitter words, as an elephant is goaded by its driver. Everywhere was heard: \u201cWithout beholding Ramacandra, of what use to us are our homes, women, wealth, sons or pleasure? There is only one who is truly virtuous and it is Lakshmana, who has followed Rama and Sita to the forest! How fortunate are those lakes and rivers filled with lotuses, whose waters, Rama, entering to bathe, does purify! Beautiful forests, rivers with verdant banks, lakes and mountains will be adorned by the presence of Shri Ramacandra. Those mountains visited by Rama, recognizing their beloved guest, will honour him with due hospitality.", "\u201cThe trees also, their branches laden with flowers and buds, in which the bees are humming and murmuring, will offer their beauty to Rama. The hills will send forth flowers out of season and yield fruit and blossom in his honour. The crystal waterfalls of varied beauty will gush forth from the mountains to give delight to him. The trees, growing on the slope of the mountains, will enchant him. Where Rama is, fear and danger are banished. The heroic sons of King Dasaratha, even now, are but a little distance from us; come let us follow them. There is no happiness save in the service of the holy Feet of that illumined One. Verily he is the only Lord of the world, the Absolute, the Highest State and our sole support.\u201d", "The women of the city, overcome with grief, addressing their husbands said: \u201cLet us follow Rama, we will serve Shri Sita, you attend on Shri Rama. Remember, Rama will preserve and maintain you in the forest, while Shri Sita will grant support to us. Of what use is life where the heart is restless and the mind bereft of purpose? If Kaikeyi rule the kingdom setting aside the moral law, what delight can we have in children and possessions; even our lives will become valueless. Will Kaikeyi be solicitous on our account, she, who has abandoned King Dasaratha and her son Shri Ramacandra, for the sake of power? We swear by our sons that while we live, we will never be slaves to Kaikeyi. Who can live happily under the rule of that shameless and evil woman who pitilessly exiled the son of the king? Without a ruler the defenceless kingdom will become a prey to every misfortune and perish on account of Kaikeyi\u2019s evil deeds. The king will not long survive the exile of Rama and without him the kingdom will be destroyed. Our good karma being exhausted we are miserable; let us either have recourse to poison, or follow Rama, or seek some other place and live there unknown. By exiling Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, through false means we have been made subject to Bharata\u2019s governance as beasts are lead to the slaughter. Shri Rama, a source of delight resembling the full moon, the destroyer of his foes, mighty-armed, Lakshmana\u2019s elder brother, whose eyes are like lotuses, who speaks in gentle accents, who is brave, guileless and beloved of the people, will assuredly adorn the forest wheresoever he roams.\u201d", "The women of the city distressed by their separation from Rama, wept and mourned as do the friends of a dying man. Lamenting thus, the sun set and the night fell, no sacrificial fires were visible, nor did the brahmins, devoted to the study of the Veda, intone the sacred texts, or recite the Puranas, and in no dwelling was any lamp kindled. The city of Ayodhya, stricken and destitute, the stalls of merchandise forsaken, was bereft of beauty like the sky divested of stars. The women of Ayodhya, filled with sorrow as if their own sons or brothers had been banished, wept bitterly, Shri Ramacandra being dearer to them than their own children. In the city, no songs or music was heard, nor was there dancing or any sign of rejoicing. The merchant ceased to expose their merchandise and sat sunk in dejection. Thus Ayodhya, without joy or activity, appeared as desolate as an ocean without water.", "Shri Rama, remembering his father\u2019s command, had travelled far through the night. Day dawned while he was still journeying; offering up his morning prayer, he continued on his way, soon reaching the southern boundary of Koshala.", "Enjoying the cultivated fields, the forests, and trees laden with blossom, he drove on, drawn by swift horses. As he passed, he heard the people of the villages and hamlets conversing thus: \u201cWoe unto King Dasaratha enslaved by concupiscence. Ah! how hard is the heart of the wicked Kaikeyi, how cruel her disposition; violating the ancient tradition, she has performed this evil deed, she who has banished the Prince of Light, who is erudite, compassionate and self-controlled. How will the daughter of King Janaka, brought up in ease, endure the hardships of the forest? Alas! The king has no love for his son or he would not have abandoned one so perfect, who is devoted to the welfare of all.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the villagers, Shri Rama pressed on quickly and crossed the boundary of Koshala. Then fording the river Vedasruti, a pure stream, he proceeded south. After traversing a great distance, he came to the cool waters of the Gaumati flowing towards the sea, with many cows grazing on its banks. The swift steeds, restrained by Rama, crossed this river and then the Syandika, on whose banks peacocks and ducks were heard. Rama here showed Sita the land formerly given by Manu to Ikshvaku, a spacious and open country of many principalities. Then Shri Rama, whose voice resembled an enchanted swan, addressed Sumantra, saying: \u201cO Charioteer, when will the day come, when I, returning from the forest in company with my parents, will sport in the flowering woods of Sarayu? To hunt in the forest is the prerogative of royal sages. It is the favourite pursuit of kings and others also incline to it. I do not deem it evil and desire to engage in it when the season of my austerities is over.\u201d", "Thus firm in his purpose, Shri Ramacandra continued to converse sweetly with Sumantra.", "[Full title: They reach the river Ganga and meet the chief of ferrymen, Guha]", "Having crossed the boundary of Koshala, Rama, turning his face towards Ayodhya, with joined palms, addressed the city: \u201cO Ayodhya, Chief of Cities, protected by the kings of the House of Ikshvaku, I take leave of you and of the gods your protectors who dwell with you. Having fulfilled the command of the king, I shall, returning from the forest, again behold you and my parents.\u201d", "Then lifting up his arms, Shri Rama, the tears falling from his eyes, addressed the citizens of his father\u2019s kingdom: \u201cO You Who have treated me with the respect and affection due to a master, it is not meet that you remain with me, now return to your homes and discharge the duties of your households.\u201d", "Bowing down to Shri Rama, the people circumambulated him with reverence and turned homewards, frequently halting, weeping and lamenting. Shri Rama, seeing them weeping and not yet satisfied with beholding him, told the charioteer to drive on speedily and passed beyond their sight as the sun sinks out of view at the time of evening.", "Proceeding on his way, Shri Rama beheld prosperous towns and villages full of men of charitable, righteous and fearless disposition evidenced by the abundance of temples and sacrificial pillars of their cities. The gardens filled with mango trees were enriched by pools of translucent water with carefully tended highways and herds of cattle grazing here and there. Everywhere the recitation of the Veda could be heard. From his chariot, Shri Rama surveyed the Kingdom of Koshala and passed beyond its confines. The sagacious Rama, proceeding through the extensive land inhabited by happy and prosperous people, enriched by pleasant gardens, came to the southern boundary of Koshala and beheld the holy Ganga, adorned by the presence of the sages, with its cool waters flowing in three directions. Near the bank of the sacred river, he saw the beautiful hermitages, frequented by holy men and pools of limpid water visited by celestial nymphs at play. The holy Ganges, honoured by deities, titans, celestial musicians and naiads, that sacred current, displaying innumerable charming vistas, embellished by the gardens of the gods, and which in heaven is named the \u201cStream of Golden Lotuses\u201d, that holy river, the sound of whose clashing waves resembles deep laughter, which moving rapidly, covered with foam white as snow, flows merrily forwards and falling from the heights on the rocks below, resembles a maiden\u2019s plaited locks; sometimes made beautiful by whirlpools, here dark and deep, there with the roar of waters, proclaiming the presence of Shri Ganga herself; those sacred waters wherein the celestial beings plunge and swim, where white lotuses float, bordered by high banks or shelving sands; there, where swans, cranes, and cakur birds are heard, where trees adorn the banks and waterlilies float or fields of lotus flowers whose buds reveal their tender beauty carpet the tide. Sometimes the waters, reddened by the petals of lotuses, make the river appear like a lovely woman attired in a crimson sari; those sparkling waters, green as emerald, where mighty tuskers sport and also the great guardian elephants of the earth\u2019s four quarters, or those bearing the gods, where the sound of Hara! Hara 1 resounds forever. Shri Ganga, beautiful as a woman, tastefully adorned with brilliant gems; Shri Ganga, enriched with fruit, flowers and birds of every hue, abounding in porpoises, crocodiles and serpents; that sacred stream, falling from the feet of the Blessed Vishnu, divine and spotless, the destroyer of others\u2019 sin, having sported in the locks of Shri Shiva, thereafter descending on earth, through the power of the penance of Bhagiratha.", "Shri Rama, proceeding towards the city of Shringavera, seeing the queen of the ocean, the holy Ganga, where the songs of the krauncha bird are heard, watching wave on wave rising on the sacred stream, that mighty warrior, Rama, said to Sumantra: \u201cO Charioteer, let us lodge here. There, under the Ingudi tree, laden with verdant leaves and blossom, let us rest. O Benevolent One, let us linger by the mighty river, whose auspicious waters are worshipped by the gods, the danavas, serpents, beasts and birds, and let us offer homage there.\u201d", "Sumantra and Lakshmana answering \u201cBe it so\u201d, stayed the chariot under the Ingudi tree.", "Arriving there, Shri Rama and Lakshmana descended from the chariot and Sumantra, unyoking the horses, respectfully seated himself facing Rama, at the foot of the tree.", "The king of that country was one, Guha, dear to Rama as his own life, by caste a ferryman, but possessing an army and designated \u201cKing of Watermen\u201d. Hearing that that Lion among men, Shri Rama, had come to his territory, he together with his aged minister and relatives went forth to meet the prince. Shri Rama, seeing the chief of ferrymen, from a distance, went with Lakshmana to meet and welcome him. Perceiving Shri Rama to be in ascetic\u2019s garb, Guha, distressed, bowing before him, said: \u201cO Prince, let this small kingdom be as Ayodhya to you, please issue your commands, I am at your service. O Mighty-armed One, it is rare to receive a guest so deeply beloved!\u201d", "Guha then brought excellent dishes of delicious foods, together with the arghya and said: \u201cWe are your servants and you are our lord, accept this kingdom and rule it as thine own. Here are dishes of various kinds, desserts, liquids, spices, excellent beds on which to rest and provender for the horses, all at your disposal.\u201d", "Shri Rama answered: \u201cO Guha, you have come to welcome me on foot out of affection, by this I am duly honoured, I am pleased with you.\u201d Then taking him in his strong arms and embracing him, Shri Rama addressed him in cheerful accents, saying: \u201cO Guha, through my good fortune I behold you and your friends in good health. Is all well among your people and with your possessions? O Friend, having renounced the acceptance of gifts, I am not able to partake of what you have offered me with love; know that having assumed the robe of kusha grass and the antelope skin, I live on fruit and roots; I am the protector of dharma and my father\u2019s servant. Being an ascetic, I may only accept a little grass for the horses and nothing beside\u2014by this alone, I am fully welcomed. These horses of my father Dasaratha are dear to him, they having received oats, grass and pure water, I am honoured in fall measure.\u201d", "On this, Guha commanded his servants to provide drink and provender for the horses. Then Rama assuming a dress of bark performed his evening devotions, drinking the water brought by Shri Lakshmana. Then Lakshmana washed the feet of Rama and Sita who had laid themselves down beneath the Ingudi tree and seated himself respectfully near them. Guha with Sumantra seated near Shri Lakshmana who, armed with bow and arrow, carefully guarded Rama, spent the night in holy converse. Rama, the wise and illustrious son of King Dasaratha, deserving every comfort and who now, lying on the ground, suffered adversity, passed the night undisturbed in deep sleep.", "Guha addressed Shri Lakshmana who was humbly guarding his royal brother, and said: \u201cO Friend, rest at ease on this soft bed prepared for you. We are fitted for the forest life, but you accustomed to ease, rest now, we will watch during the night and guard Shri Rama from harm, none is dearer to me on earth, I swear to you in truth. To gratify Shri Rama, I will acquire fame, righteousness, wealth and pleasure. I, with my bow and arrow, attended by my kindred, will watch over Shri Rama, now asleep with Sita. Wandering daily in the forest, nothing there is unknown to me, even if a powerful enemy attacked me in the forest, I could withstand him.\u201d", "Lakshmana answered: \u201cI have full faith in the power of your protection, nor do I fear any, but how, forgetful of dharma, can I refrain from watching over Shri Rama? Beholding the chief heir of Dasaratha, sovereign of the earth, lying on the ground with the daughter of King Janaka, how should I dare to rest while he is sleeping?\u201d", "See Nishada! That Mighty Prince, Shri Rama, whom none dared challenge, sleeps on a bed of straw. That Great One obtained by King Dasaratha by the merit of charity, austerity and devotion, having become an ascetic, his aged sire will not long survive and then will the earth become a widow. O Nishada, I deem the women wailing and lamenting at our departure have become silent and the royal palace also, but I fear the king, Kaushalya and my mother, will not outlast this night. Consoled by Shatrughna, my mother may endure a little while, but Queen Kaushalya, the mother of this hero, will surely yield up her life without Rama. Alas! Ayodhya, the repository of wealth and inhabited by those who love Rama, will perish through the distress caused by the king\u2019s death. How can the king live without beholding his beloved and virtuous eldest son? Queen Kaushalya also will perish, nor can my mother long survive Kaushalya\u2019s death. Alas! The whole structure of the king\u2019s purpose has fallen in ruins; desiring to appoint Rama as his regent, he will leave this world still cherishing this hope. He is fortunate who, attending the last hours of the king, performs his obsequies\u2014and then ranges the city full of charming courts, palaces and temples with intersecting streets where lovely courtesans are seen; that city abounding in splendid chariots, horses and elephants, resounding with trumpets, possessing every amenity, filled with happy people, enriched by parks and gardens where conferences and joyous gatherings are held daily. When shall we, returning from the forest, walk in the royal city? May King Dasaratha continue to live, so that we may behold that excellent monarch on our return, with Shri Rama the Upholder of Truth.\u201d", "Thus lamenting and afflicted, Shri Lakshmana, keeping watch over Rama, passed the night. Prince Lakshmana uttering words of truth and affection concerning his parents and elders, spoke thus to Guha who, grieving and disquieted, wept like an elephant in pain.", "[Full title: Sumantra is ordered to return; Shri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana cross the holy river].", "The day having dawned, the broad-chested and illustrious Rama addressed the virtuous Prince Lakshmana. \u201cLo! the goddess Night has fled and the sun is about to rise. O listen how the blackbird is singing and the peacock\u2019s cry is heard in the forest. Let us cross the swift-flowing Bhagirathi, which runs towards the sea.\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana, hearing Shri Rama\u2019s command, standing before his brother, called Guha and Sumantra. Guha divining Shri Rama\u2019s purpose, summoned his ministers and said to them: \u201cSpeedily bring a good boat, stout and strong, capable of taking Shri Rama across.\u201d", "The minister according to Guha\u2019s instruction brought an excellent boat and said: \u201cSir, the boat is ready.\u201d Then Guha, with joined palms, approaching Shri Rama thus addressed him: \u201cO Lord, your boat is at hand, what further dost you require of me? O Lion among men, O Prince, O You observer of great vows, the boat capable of crossing the river flowing towards the sea, is here, please enter it.\u201d", "The glorious Prince Rama answered Guha saying: \u201cYou have supplied me with all I could desire, now place the baggage on the boat.\u201d The princes donning their quivers, and bearing their bows, came to the place where the boat was waiting.", "Then Sumantra approaching the righteous Rama with bowed head and joined palms, said: \u201cWhat commands hast you for me, O Lord?\u201d Touching Sumantra with his right hand, Shri Rama replied: \u201cO Virtuous Sumantra, now return to the king and serve him with vigilance, I no longer need you. O Friend, leaving the chariot, I will enter the forest on foot.\u201d Sumantra receiving the order to return, imagined himself already separated from Rama and full of grief exclaimed: \u201cO Lord, none in the kingdom desires you to enter the forest with Sita and Lakshmana like a common man. When I behold you, compassionate and guileless, facing great adversity, I regard as vain, compassion, simplicity, the brahmacarya vow and the study of the Veda! O Prince, dwelling in the forest with Sita and Lakshmana will bring you renown equal to one who conquers the three worlds; but we, separated from you, O Rama, are doomed and will fall under die sway of the sinful Kaikeyi.\u201d", "The wise Sumantra, certain of Rama\u2019s departure, filled with distress, wept long and bitterly. At length, restraining his tears he purified himself with water, and was then addressed by Rama who spoke to him in gentle accents, saying: \u201cAmong the ministers of the house of Ikshvaku, none is so kind a friend. Will you, therefore, act in such wise that the king be freed from grief? The Lord of the earth is aged, his mind confused and he is tormented with desire, therefore I ask you to minister unto him. Whatever the king commands, through affection for Queen Kaikeyi, do you perform. Kings rule to fulfil their desires. O Sumantra, act in such a way that the kirfg be not displeased, and that he may not sink under the weight of affliction.", "When you dost approach him, who was hitherto a stranger to suffering, offer salutations on my behalf and say:", "\u2018Having renounced Ayodhya and entered the forest, Shri Rama, Lakshmana and Sita suffer no distress; fourteen years having passed, you shalt soon see them return!\u2019", "\u201cDeliver thus my message of affection again and again to the king, to my mother Kaushalya, the other queens and also Kaikeyi. Bowing to the feet of my mother Kaushalya, tell her that all is well with me and also with Sita and Lakshmana. Advise the king to send for Bharata speedily and when he is come, let him be installed as regent. Taking Prince Bharata in thine arms, appoint him king; you shalt thus be freed from the grief caused by this separation. Thereafter, let Bharata, on my behalf be instructed to treat our mothers with equal affection and with the same honour as is due to the king.", "Let him look on Sumitra and my mother Kaushalya as his own mother Kaikeyi. Do you say:", "\u2018If you accept the kingdom to please the king, your fame and happiness in both worlds are assured\u2019.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Shri Rama desired to dismiss Sumantra from his presence bearing the message, but the minister, deeply distressed, addressed him, saying: \u201cO Ramacandra, forgive me if I utter words lacking in reverence, urged by my devotion for you, nor deem me to be a hypocrite. O Raghava, Ayodhya, by your departure, resembles one afflicted by the loss of a son, how shall I return there without you? Seeing the chariot without you, the people will be filled with distress, the heart of the city will be riven in twain. Though you have travelled far, yet in the hearts of the citizens of Ayodhya you are still present with them. Assuredly the people have neither partaken of food nor water in thine absence. At the time of your departure, O Prince, you wast acquainted with their grief, and didst witness their weeping and lamentation. On beholding the empty chariot, their sorrow will be increased a thousandfold. On returning to Ayodhya, with what words shall I address your mother? Shall I say \u2018I have left your son at the home of your brother, do not grieve.\u2019? How can I utter such a falsehood, yet how can I relate the truth to her? Those noble steeds that have drawn the chariot bearing you, Lakshmana and Sita, how shall they be driven without you? O Sinless Prince, I cannot return to Ayodhya without you, therefore let me remain with you in the forest. If in spite of my prayer, you still renouncest me, I will, with the chariot enter a blazing fire. O Prince, whatever beings seek to frustrate your life of devotion in the forest, I will repel with my chariot. Through you, I am enabled to drive the chariot, now be gracious enough to let me enter the forest with you. Accept me, therefore, as your protector and let me enter the forest, I ask you with exceeding love. O Hero, should these excellent steeds serve you in the forest, they will acquire a high spiritual state. O Prince, by whatever means I may serve you in the forest, I would esteem it more than residence in heaven or in Ayodhya. Without you, I am unable to return to the capital, as the sinful Indra was unable to enter Amaravati. It is my highest desire when your period of exile shall be over to convey you to the capital once more. O Rama, fourteen years with you will pass like a moment, while without you, they will seem like a thousand years. O Friend of those devoted to you, I have resolved to stay in the forest with the son of my lord. How can\u2019st you abandon your devoted friend, who only seeks to do his duty?\u201d", "Thus repeatedly besought by the minister Sumantra, Shri Rama answered him saying: \u201cO Lover of your Master, I know of your devotion to me, but hear the reasons which prompt me to send you hence to Ayodhya.", "\u201cSeeing you return to the capital, my mother Kaikeyi, convinced I have entered the forest will be satisfied and will no longer reproach the king, charging him with falsehood and unrighteousness. I desire that my mother Kaikeyi should enjoy the prosperous kingdom governed by her son Bharata, therefore, to please me, return to the capital and deliver the message with which I have entrusted you.\u201d", "Thus Rama, offering explanation to Sumantra then spoke words of reason and encouragement to Guha, saying: \u201cO Guha, it is not proper for me to dwell in the forest in which my friends reside, therefore, constructing a hut of leaves and twigs elsewhere I will live as an ascetic. For the spiritual welfare of my father, I, Sita and Lakshmana, with matted hair following the ascetic discipline, will reside in the forest. Bring me, therefore, the milk of the Bhurja tree. Guha obeyed the instruction of the prince, whereupon Rama poured the viscous liquid on his own head and also on the head of Lakshmana! Thus Shri Rama, that Lion among men, and his brother Lakshmana appeared as ascetics and in their robes of bark with matted locks looked charming. Taking the vow of brahmacarya, the two brothers addressed Guha saying: \u201cO Guha, do not neglect thine armies, your treasury, your forces of defence and your people. A kingdom is governed through diligence and exertion.\u201d", "Taking leave of Guha, Shri Rama with Sita and Lakshmana went quickly towards the Ganges. Seeing the boat near the bank of the swiftly flowing river and desirous of crossing over it, Rama said to Lakshmana: \u201cO Lion among men, hold the boat firm and aid the gentle Sita to board it, then you, too, enter it.\u201d", "Acting on his brother\u2019s command, Shri Lakshmana first assisted the daughter of the King of Mithila and then boarded the boat himself. Then the resplendent Rama followed, being the last to enter and Guha ordered his servants to row them over the sacred river.", "Occupying his seat in the boat, Prince Rama began to recite the Vedic mantra for the safe conduct of all. Performing the Achmana ritual, he offered salutations to Shri Ganga and Lakshmana also made obeisance to the sacred stream. Shri Rama once more bade farewell to the charioteer, the army and Guha, and asked the helmsman to row to the other side. The boat moved swiftly to the sound of the oars.", "Arriving in midstream, the delighted Sita, with joined palms, adored Shri Ganga, saying: \u201cO Ganga, may this son of Dasaratha, obeying the commands of his father, be protected by you. May he, passing fourteen years in the forest, return again with Lakshmana and myself. Then, O Devi, O Blessed Ganga, returning with them, I will worship you. O Ganga, you are the fulfiller of pious desires. O You Tripartite Goddess, reaching to the abode of Brahma, and appearing in the mortal realm as the consort of the ocean king, O Beautiful One, I bow down to you and adore you. When, returning safely from the forest, Shri Rama occupies the throne, then I, desiring to gratify you, will give a hundred thousand cows, abundant grain and beautiful apparel to the brahmins in charity. Returning to Ayodhya, I will offer a sacrifice of a hundred jars of wine and rice to you. I will worship all the gods dwelling on your banks and all the sacred places such as Prayaga and Kashi. O Sinless One, grant that Rama and Lakshmana, free from sin, completing the term of their exile, return again to Ayodhya.\u201d", "Thus worshipping the Ganga, the Promoter of delight, they reached the further bank. Then Rama, chief of men, leaving the boat on the southern shore, proceeded to the forest with Lakshmana and Janaki, and addressed Shri Lakshmana, saying: \u201cO Son of Sumitra, do you carefully protect Shri Sita in the lonely and also the frequented areas of the forest. We must guard her in this unknown and uninhabited place, therefore, O Lakshmana, do you go before and let Sita follow you, I will walk behind to safeguard you both, let us defend each other, O Prince. So far, Shri Sita has not made trial of her strength, but from to-day she must endure the hardships of a forest life. To-day, the daughter of King Janaka will enter the forest where no man dwells, nor are there fields or gardens there, but hard and arid ground with yawning chasms everywhere.\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana, thus instructed, went ahead with Sita following him, Shri Rama coming after.", "Meantime, Sumantra, on the further bank, followed Raghava with his eyes, and overcome with grief, wept bitterly. Shri Rama, resplendent as the earth\u2019s guardians, giver of boons, having crossed the river Ganga, came to the land of Batsya.", "Thereafter, the two brothers hunted the deer and wild boar, and other beasts and growing hungry, fed on roots and berries, as ordained, resting at eventide beneath a tree.", "[Full title: Determined to follow their destiny, Shri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, enter upon exile].", "The Delighter of the World, Shri Rama, sitting beneath a tree performed his evening devotion (Sandhya) and then addressed Shri Lakshmana thus: \u201cO Brother, this is our first night in the forest without Sumantra, do not be dispirited. From now on at night but one of us shall sleep, since the protection of Shri Sita is our care. O Lakshmana, gathering leaves and grass, let us prepare a bed and lay ourselves down.\u201d", "Shri Rama, accustomed to a sumptuous and princely couch, lay that night on the bare earth. Conversing with Shri Lakshmana, he said: \u201cO Lakshmana, it may be that King Dasaratha slept fitfully this day, but Kaikeyi having realised her ambition, is surely satisfied. I fear that she, avid for the kingdom, will slay the king\u2019ere Bharata returns. The aged monarch is defenceless, a slave to Kaikeyi and subject to desire; bereft of me, how will the wretched king safeguard himself? Viewing the king\u2019s downfall and his subjection in matters of desire, it would seem that concupiscence is more powerful than wealth or virtue. O Brother, what foolish man, swayed by a woman, would abandon an obedient son like me? Bharata alone is fortunate, who, with his consort, having acquired Ayodhya, will enjoy the kingdom.", "\u201cPrince Bharata will become the ruler of the whole empire since the life of the king is drawing to its close and I have entered the forest. He who gives up righteousness and disregarding prosperity, seeks to gratify his desires, like King Dasaratha, falls a prey to sorrow. O Handsome Prince, I deem that Kaikeyi entered our house to destroy the king, to send me into exile and to install Bharata as ruler of the kingdom. O Brother, I fear that Kaikeyi, blinded by power, may persecute Kaushalya and Sumitra, they being our mothers. Do you, lest Kaushalya and Sumitra suffer, go to Ayodhya, for my sake. I, with Sita, will enter the Dandaka forest. Go you to Ayodhya and become the protector of the defenceless Queen Kaushalya. The evilly-disposed Kaikeyi, through enmity to us, may cause injury to our mothers. O Lakshmana, assuredly in some previous birth, my mother has deprived other women of their sons and is reaping the fruit of that action in this life. Woe unto me, that I should have to abandon my mother who nurtured me with exceeding love and should now enjoy felicity. O Lakshmana, may no woman give birth to a son like me, who am the source of infinite distress to my mother. O Brother, a maina taught by me, cried in the hearing of my mother, \u2018Bite the enemy\u2019s foot while you are in his mouth\u2019. O Lakshmana, my unfortunate mother is to-day sunk in an ocean of grief and I am not able to succour her. Better it were that she had had no son! Assuredly she is an object of compassion, mourning in my separation. Alas 1 what extremity of grief is hers to-day! O Lakshmana, should I give way to wrath, I were able to subdue the world not to speak of Ayodhya, but for the upholding of righteousness, I may not demonstrate my power. Should I do so, I should incur sin and endanger the life hereafter; never will I take the kingdom by force.\u201d", "Thus lamenting in the lonely forest, Rama, abandoning restraint, passed the night in tears.", "When, ceasing to lament, Lakshmana beheld Rama like an extinguished fire or a calm sea, he thus addressed him: \u201cO Great Hero, deprived of you, Ayodhya is without splendour, as the night, at the setting of the sun, but, O Rama, it is unworthy of you to grieve, sapping the courage of Sita and myself. Like fish without water, we cannot live an instant without you. O Great One, I do not desire to see my father, my brother Shatrughna or my mother Sumitra, nor even heaven itself.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Lakshmana, full of good counsel, Shri Ramacandra arose and seated himself by Sita on the bed of leaves. Determined to follow his destiny, Shri Rama entered upon the period of exile. From that day, the two great princes of the house of Raghu dwelt in the lonely forest, serene and fearless like two lions dwelling on the summit of a mountain.", "[Full title: Shri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana spend the night at Prayaga in the hermitage of the Sage Bharadvaja].", "As the sun rose in a cloudless sky, having passed the night under a banyan tree, they set out from thence and proceeded to where the Ganga and the Yamuna meet, flowing through the vast forest. The two illustrious brothers journeying onwards beheld beautiful vistas in the forest, hitherto unseen by them, and they, sometimes reclining at ease, delighted in the blossoming trees. The day being nearly over, Shri Rama said to the son of Sumitra: \u201cO Lakshmana, look towards Prayaga, smoke is rising like the fire-god\u2019s banner; undoubtedly, it is a sign that the hermitage of holy Bharadvaja is near. We have assuredly reached the junction of the Ganga and Yamuna, the sound of these mighty rivers clashing together is clearly heard. Wood-cutters have hewn the logs from mighty trees and many are cut down in the hermitage of the holy sage.\u201d Conversing thus, as the sun was setting, the two great archers reached the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna, and the hermitage of Bharadvaja. Desiring to look upon the holy sage, they halted respectfully at some little distance from the place. Then Rama slowly and reverently entered the hermitage, beholding there the omniscient Sage Bharadvaja of mighty vows, the conqueror of time by sacred discipline. Surrounded by his disciples, offering oblations into the holy fire, they beheld the rishi, and Rama with Sita and Lakshmana paid obeisance to him. Rama said: \" O Blessed and Mighty Sage, we are Rama and Lakshmana, the sons of King Dasaratha, and this, my wife, is the daughter of Videha\u2019s King, this fortunate one is following me to the lonely Tapovana. My royal sire has sent me into exile and the son of Sumitra, my younger brother, ever dear to me, taking the brahmacarya vow, has followed me. O Blessed Lord, fulfilling the behests of our father, we shall enter the sacred forest and, practising dharma, live on roots and berries.\u201d", "The virtuous sage, Bharadvaja, hearing the words of Prince Rama, offering them madhuparka together with the arghya, and water wherewith to wash their feet, thereafter gave them various roots and fruits. Then the holy sage prepared a resting place for them. The Maharishi Bharadvaja, seated amidst the deer and birds, thus honoured Rama, enquiring as to his welfare. Rama receiving the worship of the great rishi, reflected on the words spoken to him: \u201cO Prince, I behold you after a long time, I have heard that you wast exiled without cause. Remain here at ease and in peace, at this sacred and pleasant place where the two great rivers meet.\u201d", "Shri Rama, ever devoted to the good of all, answered: \u201cO Lord, your hermitage is close to the abodes of men and many will come hither to gaze on Sita and myself. I therefore do not deem it wise to linger here. O Blessed One, do you inform me of a lonely place, where Sita, the daughter of Janaka, may live in happiness.\u201d", "In gentle accents Shri Bharadvaja replied: \u201cO Child, ten miles from here, there is a mountain, purified by the presence of many sages who dwell there, beautiful and pleasing to the sight, there do you abide. Monkeys, bears and chimpanzees wander there freely. That mountain is Cittrakuta, delightful as Gandhamadana. Those beholding the peaks of Cittrakuta, obtain spiritual merit, their minds admit no sin and, living there, they win divine rewards. Many sages, performing austerities there for thousands of years, have entered heaven in their embodied state. O Rama, this lovely place is a fit residence for you, I deem, if you will not remain here with me until the period of thine exile be past.\u201d Thus Bharadvaja honoured Rama with Sita and Lakshmana offering them every mark of hospitality due to their royal state. So in the hermitage of the great sage at Prayaga, Rama spent the night in converse on ancient times. Relieved of weariness, Shri Rama with Lakshmana and Sita passed the night pleasantly in the sacred hermitage. When morning dawned, Shri Ramacandra, approaching the great sage made resplendent by virtue of austere practices, thus addressed him: \u201cO You devoted to truth, we have passed the night at ease in your hermitage now grant us leave to depart to the place appointed by you.\u201d", "Shri Bharadvaja then made answer. \u201cO Rama, set out for the mountain Cittrakuta abounding in honey, roots and fruit, worthy to be your dwelling, covered with trees and the abode of heavenly beings; there, peacocks cry and mighty tuskers roam. Go then to that sacred place, which is pleasant and filled with fruit and flowers, and where elephants and deer wander through the woods. There, lingering with Sita by the springs and waterfalls, the mountain slopes and peaceful caves, your mind will find delight. O Rama, do you depart to dwell on that high and lovely mountain thronged with elephants and various beasts, where the tittibha1 and the kokila sing.\u201d", "Shri Rama and Lakshmana, the conquerors of their foes, having passed the night in Prayaga, offered obeisance to the sage and proceeded towards Cittrakuta. On their departure, Shri Bharadvaja gave them his blessing as a father blesses his son and addressing Rama, that hero of the region of truth, said:", "\u201cO Great One, proceeding west of the junction of the rivers, on the bank of the Yamuna, which flows into the swiftly-moving Ganga, you will find a worn-out ferryboat. Do you pass over the stream by means of a rod to which, at either end, an upturned pitcher is hung. On the opposite shore, you will behold a mighty green-leaved fig-tree surrounded by many others. The leaves of this tree are of a dark green hue and it is frequented by siddhas. Reaching that place, do you, with Janaki pray for the accomplishment of your legitimate desires. Rest there awhile, then pass beyond it; reaching Nilvan at a mile\u2019s distance, there many sala, jamnu and badri trees are seen, that is the way to Cittrakuta and often have I journeyed on that path. Beautiful it is and free from thorns and there is no danger there of a forest fire.\u201d", "After pointing out the way to Shri Rama, the sage turned back to his own hermitage.", "Offering salutations to the saint, Shri Rama, having taken his leave, said to Lakshmana: \u201cO Lakshmana, surely we are fortunate in that the holy Rishi has treated us so graciously.\u201d", "Conversing thus, the two princes proceeded onwards, Shri Sita walking before them, and came to the bank of the swiftly-flowing Yamuna. Then they began to consider how they should pass over it, and collecting some wood constructed a raft, tying together lengths of dried bamboo and filling the interstices with kusha grass. Then Lakshmana, spreading the branches of jambu and vettas trees, made Sita a comfortable seat. Shri Sita shyly holding the hand of her lord, Shri Rama placed his Beloved on the raft with her clothing and ornaments beside her. Thereafter placing the axes and the chest covered with deerskins, containing their weapons there, the two brothers began to sail. Arriving in mid-stream, Shri Sita, bowing low, prayed to the holy river saying: \u201cO Devi, forgive us for passing over you, grant that my lord may fulfil his vow without obstructions. When I return, to please you I will offer a thousand cows in charity.\u201d Then with joined palms, she said: \u201cMay the Lord of the House of Ikshvaku return in peace to the capital.\u201d", "Having crossed the rippling Yamuna, the swift daughter of the sun, they reached its southern bank; there abandoning the raft, they entered the woods and the river bank and came to the heavily shadowed fig tree.", "Shri Sita said: \u201cO Mighty Tree, I make obeisance to you, may my lord fulfil his vow, so that I may again behold Shri Kaushalya and Queen Sumitra.\u201d", "Then Sita circumambulated the tree with reverence and Rama beholding the lovely Sita praying for his welfare, said to Lakshmana: \u201cDo you go forward with Sita of whom no ill word has ever been uttered, who is ever obedient to me and is dearer than life itself. O Chief of Men, I, with my weapons will follow after. Whatever fruit or flower the daughter of Janaka may desire in the forest, do you gather for her, so that her mind may find delight.\u201d", "Shri Sita, between the two princes, walked like a female elephant guarded by two tuskers; the daughter of Janaka, beholding many things, formerly unknown to her, questioned Rama concerning every tree, shrub and climbing plant. Seeing many beautiful trees covered with blossom, Shri Lakshmana brought the princess all she desired. Viewing the river and its sandy banks caressed by the waves, where swans and cranes called, Shri Sita was filled with happiness.", "Having travelled some distance, the two valiant brothers slew many deer for food, then, with Sita, passed through the pleasant woods, ringing with the cries of peacocks and frequented by elephants and monkeys.", "Perceiving a delightful and sheltered place which found favour with Sita, they lodged there free from fear.", "[Full title: They reach the mountain Cittrakuta and build a hut].", "The night being past, Shri Rama, slowly waking, roused the sleeping Lakshmana and addressed him, saying: \u201cO Lakshmana, how beautiful are the parrots, cuckoos, mainas and other birds which are heard here 1 O Parantapa, this is the hour to pursue our journey, let us go hence, O Prince!\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana, renouncing sleep, shook off his drowsiness and rose refreshed. All of them rising and bathing in the river Yamuna, offered up their morning prayers. Then, taking the path through the palasa forest, they proceeded towards Cittrakuta as directed by the holy sage.", "Walking with Lakshmana, Rama now spoke to the lotus-eyed Sita, saying: \u201cO Daughter of King Videha, see how the spring has dressed the palasa trees in sweet-scented blossom, these crimson flowers glowing like fire and the branches decked with flowers as if adorned with garlands. How rich in bloom are the bilva trees untouched by man who is not able to approach them. Here we can easily gather food. See, O Lakshmana, hanging on the trees, the honeycombs at least a drona in size, covered with bees. How charmingly the waterbird is singing and the peacock answering with its call, and look! the earth is half concealed with flowers. Here are the lofty peaks of Cittrakuta where countless birds sing and herds of elephants wander. Somewhere on Cittrakuta a level field must lie midst groves of trees, a pure and stainless place, where we will dwell.\u201d", "The two brothers, in company with Sita, conversing thus, reached the pleasant and captivating mountain of Cittrakuta. Coming to that place, on which there were birds of many kinds, abounding in various roots and pleasant fruits and dear transparent pools, Rama said to Lakshmana: \u201cO Gentle Brother, how pleasant is this hill covered with shady trees, creepers and fruits of many kinds, appearing delightful and where we may abide unmolested. Within the forest, many sages dwell, this place is meet to be our hermitage.\u201d", "Thus resolving, Rama, Lakshmana and Sita came to the hermitage of the Sage Valmiki and, with reverence, offered obeisance to him. The virtuous sage, full of joy, paid homage to them, asking them to be seated saying: \u201cYou are most wdcome!\u201d", "Shri Rama, presenting himself together with his brother and Sita, rdated the cause of his exile to the sage and then addressed Lakshmana, saying: \u201cO Brother, bring strong wood and let us build a hut in this place. O Excellent Prince, here do I wish to dwell.\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana thereupon brought many pieces of wood, hewn from the trees, and erected a hut thatched with leaves. When Shri Rama beheld that firm and pleasant hut furnished with a door, he said to the devoted Lakshmana: \u201cO Lakshmana, bring venison with which we may worship the deity of the dwelling-place I Since we purpose to live here long, we should enter it with peaceful intention! O Son of Sumitra, having killed a black deer, bring it here speedily. Let us follow the scriptural ordinance in this matter.\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana, having obeyed his brother\u2019s command, Rama said: \u201cNow dress the meat and we will offer it as a sacrifice. Hasten, O Brother, this is an auspicious hour.\u201d", "The illustrious son of Sumitra slew a black antelope and roasted it in the flames. When it was dressed and the blood drained from it, Lakshmana addressed Raghava, saying: \u201cO Godlike One, I have prepared the flesh of the black deer, now offer up the sacrifice to propitiate the god.\u201d", "The devout and resplendent Rama, skilled in silent prayer and sacrifice, having bathed, recited the holy texts, offering homage to the gods, then entered the hut, his heart filled with joy. Having adored Rudra and Vishnu for the purification of the dwelling, he read the Peace Chant and other propitiatory prayers. Repeating the japa and bathing in the river, he offered oblations for the expiation of sins. He then erected altars in the eight directions for the worship of different gods and gratifying the deities presiding over the elements with offerings of flowers, garlands, fruits, cooked meats and the recitation of Vedic mantrans, he, together with Sita, entered the delightful hut, thatched with leaves, set up in a suitable place, sheltered from the wind.", "Shri Rama, of subdued senses, dwelt happily in that habitation, built in the forest, the abode of beasts and birds, abounding in trees and flowers, where elephants wandered and the cries of wild beasts re-echoed.", "Living on the pleasant mountain, Cittrakuta, by the banks of the river Malati, Rama forgot the capital and remembered his renunciation no more.", "Separated from Rama, Guha was filled with distress. Conversing long with the charioteer, he perceived Rama reach the southern shore, and turned homewards.", "Sumantra hearing fully from the men of Shrangverpira of Rama\u2019s arrival at Prayaga, his meeting and residence with the Rishi Bharadvaja and his journey towards Cittrakuta, bade farewell to Guha and yoking his horses to the chariot, with a sorrowful heart, started for Ayodhya. Speedily passing through flower-laden forests and viewing the rivers, pools, villages and towns, he reached the stricken city of Ayodhya on the evening of the third day. Seeing the silent city, he reflected: \u201cHas the city with its sovereign, men, elephants and horses been consumed by the fire of grief, caused by the separation from Rama?\u201d", "Pondering thus, in his swiftly borne chariot, Sumantra reached the gate of the inner city and entered it. There innumerable people rushed towards die chariot and surrounding it, cried: \u201cWhere is Shri Rama?\u201d \u201cWhere is Shri Rama?\u201d and Sumantra answered: \u201cHaving reached the banks of the Ganga, the virtuous Rama ordered me to return, therefore, I have come.\u201d Then the people, finding Rama had crossed the sacred river, their eyes filled with tears, sighing heavily, cried: \u201cO Rama, O Rama!\u201d and all exclaimed with one voice, \u201cAlas! We are deprived of the sight of Rama, we are destroyed 1 We shall no more behold Rama, the distributor of gifts and performer of sacrifices, who sat in our assemblies and who resembled the beautifully adorned Meru mountain 1 Alas! Where is Shri Rama, our protector, acquainted with the need of each and the happiness of all!\u201d", "Then Sumantra, proceeding further, heard on every side, through the lattices of the houses the wailing of women mourning for Rama and hearing their lamentations on the royal highway, the charioteer, covering his face, passed quickly on towards the palace of the king.", "Descending with all speed from his chariotj he passed beyond the seven gates and entered the royal residence. Seeing Sumantra return alone, the women, seated at the balconies and windows of the palace, seven-stories high, languishing in Rama\u2019s separation, broke into loud lamentations. Exchanging glances, their eyes streaming with tears, in broken accents they gave expression to their grief. He heard, too, the feeble wailing of the queens of King Dasaratha, saying: \u201cWhat will Sumantra, who went forth with Rama and has returned alone, say to the stricken Queen Kaushalya? Surely the human soul suffers pain and anxiety more readily than joy, since Queen Kaushalya still lives separated from Rama.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the queens and weighed down with sorrow, Sumantra entered the residence of the king and passing through the eighth door beheld in the white chamber, the wretched king, disconsolate and wasted with grief on account of his son. Approaching the king seated there, Sumantra making obeisance to him delivered the message entrusted to him by Shri Rama.", "The king heard it in silence, his mind agitated with pain and grief and fell unconscious to the earth. The queens, seeing the king fallen in a swoon, lifted him in their arms and covered him with tears. Kaushalya and Sumitra raising the fallen monarch from the ground addressed him, saying: \u201cO You Fortunate One, why dost you not answer the messenger of Rama who has accomplished his arduous task? O King, having exiled Rama, why art you now full of shame? Arise, there is no cause for this distress. O Lord, Queen Kaikeyi is not here, in fear of whom you dost not dare address Sumantra. Speak without fear.\u201d", "Thus exhorting the king, Queen Kaushalya fell insensible, her throat choked on account of her grief.", "The ladies of the court and the other queens, perceiving Kaushalya lying on the ground lamenting, began to weep aloud. Then all the people of Ayodhya, old and young, hearing the wailing from the inner apartments of the palace, broke into lamentation, as on the day when Rama had left the city.", "The king, recovering consciousness after a while, summoned the royal charioteer and turned his gaze upon him. Sumantra reverently approached the aged monarch who was grieving and restless, and sighing heavily like a newly-captured elephant. Then the afflicted sovereign spoke to Sumantra who was most miserable, his body covered with dust, his eyes suffused with tears, and said: \u201cO Charioteer, that virtuous one, worthy of every comfort and happiness will now be seeking refuge under a tree. O! What will be his food? How will Rama, the son of King Dasaratha, who merits no suffering, who is worthy of resting on a royal couch, sleep as one orphaned, on the bare earth? How can that prince, formerly accompanied by soldiers and elephants, and whose chariot was drawn by matchless steeds, now sleep in the lonely forest? How will Rama and Sita be able to dwell in the forest abounding with pythons and other wild beasts? O Sumantra, how can the tender and sorrow-stricken Sita with the two princes, abandoning the chariot, walk barefooted in the forest? O Charioteer, you are fortunate in that you have seen the two princes wandering in the forest like the Ashvini Kumaras on the mountain Mandara. O Sumantra, when they entered the forest, what did Rama say? What did Lakshmana say? What did Sita say? O Charioteer, tell me fully of Rama\u2019s dwelling, his sleeping and his eating, thus shall I live a little longer, like King Yayati of old, on hearing the words of the sadhus.\u201d", "Thus questioned by his royal master, Sumantra, his throat choked, his speech broken by sobs, replied: \u201cO Great King, Shri Rama, the Upholder of righteousness, reverently joining his palms and bowing his head, said:", "\u2018On my command, offer salutations again and again to the most praiseworthy sovereign, renowned far and wide in the world as highly virtuous, and to all the men and women of the inner apartment, carry tidings of my welfare with salutations befitting their rank. Convey the news of my welfare to my mother Kaushalya, with my deepest respect and admonish her not to neglect her duty. Let her practise dharma and tend the sacrificial pavilion. Say to her: \u2018O Goddess, honour the king, my father, as you wouldst a God. Abandoning family pride and royal prerogative, serve my other mothers attentively. Kaikeyi is the king\u2019s favourite, do you attend to her as to the king himself.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cO King, Shri Rama has instructed Prince Bharata thus:", "\u2018Let it be known to the prince, that I am well and instruct him to treat all his mothers with justice. Tell the illustrious Prince Bharata that, though regent, he must continue in obedience to his royal father. The king is far advanced in years, let not Prince Bharata proclaim himself king. Let him obey the king and act as co-adjutor.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cShri Rama charged me with tears, saying:", "\u2018Let Bharata look upon my beloved mother as his own.\u2019", "The mighty armed and highly illustrious Rama of lotus eyes addressing me thus, wept aloud.", "\u201cThen Shri Lakshmana growing wrath and sighing heavily, said: \u2018What fault has this noble prince committed to be exiled? Assuredly the king has agreed to the foolish desire of Queen Kaikeyi, granting her boons without considering if they were proper or improper, through which we are all involved in misery. If Rama has suffered exile to satisfy the stupidity of Queen Kaikeyi, then assuredly it is an evil act. Even if the gods decreed the exile of Rama, I see no reason for it. Acting with imperfect understanding the king regardless of consequences has banished Rama which will surely cause him untold suffering. I see no parental affection in the king; to me Shri Ramacandra is brother, master, relative and father. The darling of the whole world, Shri Ramacandra, devoted to the good of all, has been banished, how can the people approve this act? Having, in opposition to the will of the people, exiled Shri Ramacandra, who is virtuous and beloved, how can he claim to be a king?", "\u201cThe sagacious Janaki, O King, stood mute, her eyes fixed and vacant, like one possessed by a spirit. That illustrious daughter of Janaka, unacquainted with suffering, wept with grief and was unable to speak. Seeing the countenance of her lord wet with tears, her mouth became parched, and gazing at me, she wept bitterly. Thus Shri Rama, his face drawn with grief, supported by Lakshmana, addressed me, seated in the royal chariot, while the ascetic Sita fixed her gaze on me in silence.\u201d", "Sumantra said: \u201cO King, when Shri\u2019Rama entered the forest, I returned and the weary horses halting, stood still, showing signs of distress. Offering obeisance to the two princes, I mounted the chariot and restraining my grief, went forward, remaining a few days with Guha, in the hope that Shri Rama might call me again and take me with him.", "\u201cO King, turning homewards, I beheld the very trees filled with distress, their tender shoots, buds and flowers being withered! The water in the pools and rivers was slowly ebbing away, the leaves in the woods were falling and the beasts were motionless, the restless elephants no longer wandered here and there. Afflicted by Rama\u2019s separation, the forest had become silent. O King, the waters in the ponds had grown turbid and the lotuses had submerged themselves, being unable to bear the severance from Rama. The fishes and water fowl had deserted their accustomed haunts and the aquatic plants and those that grew on land no longer gave forth their fragrant scents, while their fruits were devoid of taste. Gardens were bereft of beauty and birds sat motionless in the woods.", "\u201cEntering Ayodhya, none appeared to be happy and the citizens beholding the royal chariot without Rama were perpetually sighing. O Lord, seeing, from a distance, the chariot returning without Rama, all were plunged in grief. The women of the city, from their windows, balconies and roofs, seeing the chariot without Rama, broke into lamentation. With tears falling from their unpainted eyes, full of distress, they withdrew their gaze from all. To-day, I am unable to distinguish friend or foe owing to grief. All men together with elephants and horses, join in the suffering and mourning, all are afflicted in Rama\u2019s separation 1 The city of Ayodhya, neglected and wretched, resembles Queen Kaushalya bereft of her son!\u201d", "Hearing these words, the king became agitated and in trembling accents addressed the charioteer: \u201cO Sumantra, deeply penitent am I, that without deliberating with my able counsellors and elders, I granted the boons to the evil-minded Kaikeyi, under the sway of Manthara. This unpremeditated act was performed by me, inspired by my desire for Kaikeyi, without consultation with my friends and ministers. O Sumantra, this great calamity is the result of fate and will destroy the House of Ikshvaku. O Charioteer 1 If I have ever done any good to you, then take me to Shri Ramacandra soon; my life is fast ebbing from my body, or do you go to the forest and cause Rama to return, if he be still obedient to me. If that Mighty One be gone far from here, then take me in the chariot and drive there speedily; I desire to look on him but once more. Where is Rama, the elder brother of Lakshmana, whose teeth resemble the water lilies and who is a mighty warrior? If I am to live, I must see that virtuous one. If I do not behold Rama with reddened eyes, wearing beautiful earrings, set with jewels, I shall assuredly perish. O! What can exceed my pain, that, at the moment of death, I am unable to see Rama, the hero of the House of Ikshvaku? O Rama, O Lakshmana, O Patient Sita, you do not know that I am dying in bitter anguish.\u201d", "The king, his mind drowned in the sea of sorrow, cried: \u201cO Kaushalya, that ocean of misery caused by Rama\u2019s separation is fathomless, severance from Sita are its shores, deep sighs are the whirlpools rendered turbid by my tears, the stretching of the arms are its restless motion, lamentations are the sound of its thunder, dishevelled hair are the weeds, the words of Manthara are the crocodiles and Kaikeyi is the fire in its depths, the unscaleable cliffs are the boons which sent Rama to the forest. Without Rama, I am sinking in this bottomless sea, living, I am unable to cross over it. I desire to see Rama and Lakshmana this day, but alas 1 I am unable to obtain my desire, as a result of some great sin formerly committed by me.\u201d", "Thus complaining, the king fell senseless on the couch. The monarch, bewailing the absence of Rama, swooned away. Hearing the king\u2019s words, the mother of Rama, Queen Kaushalya, was seized with fear.", "Queen Kaushalya, lying trembling on the ground like one dead or possessed by an evil spirit, now said to the charioteer: \u201cO Sumantra, take me to the place where Rama, Lakshmana and Janaki dwell! Life without them, even for a moment, is vain. Speedily return there in your chariot, either I must follow them or enter the region of death.\u201d", "Shri Sumantra, weeping and distressed, respectfully sought to console the Queen, saying: \u201cO Lady, abandon disquiet, infatuation and anxiety born of grief! Shri Rama will live happily in the forest! Prince Lakshmana, self-subdued, serving Rama and living in accordance with virtue will fashion for himself an auspicious future. In the solitary forest, Shri Sita, her mind wholly centered on Rama in devotion, will live without fear, as in her own home. I see no lack of courage in Princess Sita, it would appear that she was born to reside in a strange land. As in former days, she enjoyed the parks and gardens, so does she now enjoy the uninhabited forest. Sita, whose countenance resembles the full moon, her mind absorbed in Rama, depending on him, sports in the forest; with her heart and mind centred on him, she would hold this great capital no better than a wilderness without Rama. Walking in the forest, seeing the. villages, rivers, towns and various kinds of trees, she enquires of Rama concerning their history and origin. To her, the forest is a pleasure garden in the neighbourhood of Ayodhya. This I remember of Sita, but what she said of Kaikeyi now slips my mind.\u201d", "Sumantra, carefully withholding the reference to Kaikeyi which had escaped from him through inadvertence and in order to propitiate Queen Kaushalya, addressed her further, saying: \u201cThe lustre of the face of Janaki is not marred by the fatigue' of the journey or the winds or through fear of dangerous beasts or through the heat of the sun. The countenance of the Princess, resembling the full moon is not impaired by residence in the forest. Her feet, no longer painted with vermilion, appear as fresh as lotuses.", "The princess ever exceedingly devoted to Rama, has not put off her ornaments, but with her tinkling anklets trips happily along, causing the very swans to envy her. Depending on the power of Shri Rama, she suffers no fear at the sight of a lion or tiger in the forest. O Lady, there is no cause for grief for these three or for the king or thyself. The self-imposed exile of Shri Rama, in obedience to his father\u2019s command, will remain a subject for veneration to the whole world, as long as the sun and moon abide. Having banished sorrow, Shri Rama pursuing the path trodden by the sages, living on fruits and berries, fulfils the behest of his sire.\u201d", "Though consoled by the charioteer, Queen Kaushalya, torn with grief, in the separation from her son, cried out: \u201cO My Darling, O My Son, O Rama,\u201d and continued to weep.", "The virtuous Rama, the upholder of dharma, having departed, Queen Kaushalya weeping bitterly, addressed her royal consort: \u201cO King, Your fair name is known throughout the three worlds; you are esteemed compassionate, charitable and of gentle speech. Yet, O Great One, tell me, how will your two sons, brought up in ease together with Sita, be able to endure the forest life? How will the young and tender Sita, worthy of happiness, endure heat and cold? How will that large-eyed princess, who lived on dishes prepared by skilful cooks, sustain life on the wild lentils of the forest? How will she, accustomed to the sweet strains of music, be able to bear the roaring of man-eating lions? How will the two mighty princes, whose arms resemble the rainbow, sleep on the ground, pillowing their heads on their arms. O When will I again behold the lotus face of Rama, framed in beautiful locks, whose eyes are like the water-lily and whose breath is fragrant as the nymphoea? Surely my heart must be as hard as a diamond that it does not break into a thousand pieces, bereft of Rama. O King, in banishing your children, you have been merciless. Worthy of every comfort, they are now wandering aimlessly in the forest. Should Rama return, after fourteen years, will Prince Bharata restore the kingdom and the treasure to him? If those inviting the pious and learned brahmins to the funeral sacrifice, first serve their poor and deserving relations and subsequently the brahmins these will not accept the food of that sacrifice, renouncing it like wine. The learned brahmins regard it as a mark of disrespect to be served even with that in which other brahmins have already participated, which is like a bull shorn of its horns, of lesser worth. O Master of your People, will not Rama even thus disdain the kingdom enjoyed by his younger and undeserving brother? A lion will not eat the food killed by another, neither will Rama accept that which has already been enjoyed by others. As the libations, butter, kusha grass and pillars employed in the sacrifice, are not used again, so will Rama not accept a kingdom which resembles a sacrifice without soma.", "Shri Rama will never suffer this indignity, as a lion will not suffer the twisting of its tail. Do not all fear Rama as he appears on the battlefield? He, himself, is righteous, indicating the path of virtue to others, never will he seize the kingdom by force! Is not the mighty-armed Rama with his golden shafts, able to destroy all living beings and dry up the sea? Yet to-day, that Rama, powerful as a lion, is rendered impotent at the king\u2019s command, as the spawn of fishes is devoured by their parents? O King, hadst you regarded the scriptures and the eternal laws, observed and inculcated by the learned sages, your virtuous son had not been exiled by you. O Lord, the first support of a woman is her husband, the second is her son, the third her relatives, but a fourth she has not! You have ceased to regard me as thine, you have banished my son Rama, and I may not follow him and leave you desolate. O Lord, you have destroyed me utterly! O King, you have brought disaster on your counsellors, the whole kingdom, the ministers and thyself, and I with my son and all the citizens of Ayodhya are utterly ruined.\u201d", "Hearing the bitter reproaches of his consort, the king, reflecting on the cause of this calamity, overwhelmed with grief, fell senseless, drowned in the sea of sorrow.", "Filled with anguish on hearing the harsh words of Queen Kaushalya, the king began to reflect on what could be done. Regaining consciousness, he sighed heavily and began to ponder within himself. He then remembered how, formerly, he had slain a young ascetic inadvertently by a sound-directed arrow, in the forest.", "The monarch was now subject to a dual cause of grief, the recollection of his former evil deed and his banishment of Rama. Thus afflicted, with bowed head, the king addressed the queen in faltering tones: \u201cO Kaushalya, ever compassionate to thine enemies, I entreat you, with joined palms, not to look on me with hostility. O Lady, to the wife, the husband is a deity be he virtuous or worthless, this is the eternal law. I know you to be wise and acquainted with what is proper and improper, it is not meet that you should utter these wounding words.\u201d", "Hearing this plaintive speech, tears welled from the eyes of the queen like falling rain and taking his hands in hers, she addressed the king, saying: \u201cO Lord, do not grieve, be at peace, see, I lay my head at your feet, do not entreat me, it is as death to me! I have spoken what ought not to be uttered, pardon my transgression! That woman is not nobly bred, who expects her lord to solicit her with humble words. O Sire, I am acquainted with a woman\u2019s duty and I know you to be a lover of virtue. What I have said was uttered involuntarily through distress on account of my son. Grief destroys patience, grief destroys the understanding, there is nothing more destructive than grief! The blow of an unknown enemy may be endured but the distress arising from grief is not easily borne, even with resignation. This is only the fifth night since the exile of Rama but to me they are as five years. Sorrow has driven away every joy from my breast and because of Rama my pain increases, agitating my heart as the waters of a swiftly flowing river disturb the ocean.\u201d", "While the queen was yet speaking, the sun declined and the night fell. Consoled by the words of Queen Kaushalya, the king, wearied with grief, sank into slumber.", "[Full title: The king recalls a former evil deed which is the cause of his present distress].", "A full hour having passed, the king awoke and was overcome with distress. He began to ponder deeply, but his mind was clouded with grief and though equal to Indra, death threatened to seize him as Rahu seizes the sun.", "The sixth night after Rama\u2019s exile, the king again remembered his former evil deed and agitated by the recollection of his sin, he addressed the Queen Kaushalya: \u201cO Kalyani, O Auspicious One, whatever man does, be it good or evil, he gathers the fruit thereof. He is deemed ignorant who does not consider the merit or demerit of his actions before performing them. O Queen, he, who, enjoying the red flowers of the palasa tree, cuts down the adjoining mango tree and yet desires to partake of mangoes, will not realize his expectation when the palasa bears fruit. He, who, heedless of the consequences, enters into action, will in the end repent like the man who waters the palasa tree.", "\u201cO Lady, I have cut down the mango tree and watered the palasa tree, now, when the fruit is ripe, I too, having banished Rama, repent bitterly. O Kaushalya, in order to be esteemed as an archer, in my youth, I directed my arrows by sound alone, and a grievous deed was committed by me. I am the cause of this present distress. O Queen, as a child swallows poison in ignorance, so have I destroyed my happiness by this deed formerly committed in ignorance. As one beguiled by the beauty of the palasa flower, waters it in expectation of the sweet fruit (of the mango) so did I cultivate the fruit I now reap, by shooting at a sound. O Lady, in those days we were not united in marriage and I was heir-apparent.", "\u201cAt that time, the rainy season being near, the increase of desire having come, the sun drying up the earth, scorching the world with its rays, entered the southern path. Then the heat subsided and refreshing clouds covered the sky, delighting the peacocks, the frogs and the swallows. The birds drenched with the rain, passed the night in distress, tossed to and fro on the trees by the humid winds. The limpid water in the streams dark and turgid from deposits of the mountain soil, flowed onwards sluggishly.", "\u201cIn that delightful season, taking my bow and arrows in my chariot, I came to the bank of the river Sarayu, desiring to hunt. Taking my stand at a ford, where buffaloes, elephants and tigers came at night to drink, I heard the sound as of a pitcher being filled with water in the darkness. Seeing nought and deeming it to be the sound of an elephant, I took from my quiver an arrow dipped in the poison of a snake and discharged it whence the sound came.", "Having discharged the keen and poisoned shaft, I heard the voice of a youth crying out, and he, pierced in the side, fell exclaiming", "\u2018Who has shot an ascetic who has no enemy in the whole world? Desirous of drawing water, I came here in the dead of night. What harm had I done to him who has smitten me? Why should I, who live on fruits and roots in the forest, and have injured none by word or deed, be slain by weapons? What gain is there in destroying one wearing bark and deerskin? To whom have I done an injury? Such an act is unlawful, as one who does not respect the couch of his Guru is considered an abandoned person, so he who has wrongfully smitten me, cannot be a virtuous man. I do not grieve for the loss of my own life, but for what will befall my parents, when I die! To what condition will they be brought on my death, that aged pair so long supported by me? My mother, my father and I have been killed by a single arrow! By what foolish man have we all been slain?\u2019", "\u201cO Kaushalya, I, ever desirous of acquiring virtue and eschewing what was evil, hearing this sad complaint, became exceedingly distressed and the bow fell from my hands. The lament of the sage caused me the deepest affliction and overwhelmed with grief I advanced to where he lay, wounded by my arrow. There I beheld him lying on the ground, his hair dishevelled, his body besmeared with blood and dust, the water flowing from his loshta which lay at some distance from him.", "Seeing me standing there dismayed, he fixed me with his gaze as if he would consume me, and said:", "\u2018O King, what harm have I, a dweller in the forest, done to you, that you have wounded me while fetching water from the river for my aged parents? You have inflicted a mortal wound by thine arrow and have in this wise slain my mother and father also, who weak, aged and blind and the victims of exceeding thirst, await my return. Afflicted with thirst, they are watching for my return. Alas! what fruit have I earned by the practice of penance and the hearing of the Veda and Puranas since my father does not know that I am lying mortally wounded here? Yet if he knew, what could he do, since he is blind and a cripple? As a tree cut down cannot support another, so my parents blind and crippled cannot assist me. O King, go speedily to my father and inform him of my plight. I fear lest he curse you and consume you as a fire burns up wood! O King, the path beheld by you leads to my parents\u2019 hut. Do you go there and propitiate them, O King, that they may not wax wrath and curse you. O King, free my side from this shaft; this arrow penetrating my body resembles a river that washes away the long and sandy bank.\u2019", "\u201cO Lady, I reflected that as long as the arrow remained fixed he would not die, though suffering great pain, but should I extract it, he would certainly perish.", "The son of the muni, seeing me afflicted and reading my thoughts addressed me in great agony and said:", "\u2018O King, though in anguish and confused, my body quivering with pain and about to die, yet I am able to control my distress and am at peace. Dismiss your fears, O King, though your sin is grievous, you have not slain a brahmin. O King, I am born of a shudra mother and a vaishya father.\u2019", "\u201cAs he was speaking, his eyes rolling, his face blanched, struggling and quivering on the earth, I withdrew the arrow and he, looking up in agony, yielded up his breath.", "\u201cO Queen, deeply afflicted, I beheld that treasury of truth, lamenting, his body bathed in sweat, in the act of giving up his life.\u201d", "The king, grieving over the separation from his son, continued to describe the infamous deed, the slaying of the young ascetic, to the queen and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Kaushalya, having unwittingly committed this impious deed, I, deeply distressed, reflected what could now be done and decided to seek out the parents and propitiate them. Taking the pitcher, filled with water, I bore it to the ascetic\u2019s hermitage and there beheld his mother and father, aged and feeble, seated together, like two birds bereft of their wings. Motionless, deprived by me of their support, they sat, conversing of their son and awaiting the water. My mind was clouded with grief and I was smitten with fear, but seeing the aged pair, my anguish was increased a thousandfold.", "\u201cHearing the sound of my steps, the father spoke:", "\u2018O My Son, why hast you delayed so long? Give me water speedily, O Child, why hast you been diverting thyself in the water? Come quickly into the hermitage, your mother is exceedingly anxious. O My Son, if aught your mother has done has displeased you, it behoves you to forget it. You are our only support who are blind and crippled; you are our very eyes, our lives are dependent on you, why dost you not speak to us?\u2019", "\u201cBeholding the muni, and as one sorely dismayed, I uttered inarticulate words, then by force of will, controlling my speech, I related to him the whole misfortune.", "Slowly, I narrated to the sage the distressing fate that had befallen his son and said:", "\u2018O Mahatma, I am not your son, my name is Dasaratha and I am a kshatriya. A sinful act has been committed by me of which I now repent. O Lord, armed with bow and arrow I came to the bank of the Sarayu to hunt the elephant, tiger or lion, that might come there to drink. Hearing the sound of a pitcher being filled with water and supposing it to be an elephant, I discharged an arrow and coming to the bank of the river beheld an ascetic lying on the ground pierced to the heart by my weapon. O Lord, having mistaken your son, who had gone to seek water, for an elephant, I slew him by an arrow discharged on hearing that sound. On his entreaty I extracted the arrow from his heart causing him pain and he left this life lamenting for his blind parents. Your son was suddenly and unknowingly slain by me without design; what was to happen, has been accomplished. You are a sage, now do what you considerest proper.\u2019", "\u201cHearing the tale of my evil deed from my own lips, the sage refrained from pronouncing a curse on me. His eyes suffused with tears and his heart distressed, he addressed me who supplicated him with joined palms, saying:", "\u2018O King, if you thyself had\u2019st not confessed this evil deed to me, your head had instantly split into a thousand pieces by my curse. O King, the killing of one dwelling in the forest by a kshatriya causes him to lose his status, even if he be Indra. If anyone knowingly attacks a sage or spiritual preceptor with a weapon, his head is severed into seven pieces. You livest still, since the deed was done by you without design, else hadst you and the whole House of Raghu perished.\u2019", "\u201cO Kaushalya, the sage said:", "\u2018Take me to the place where the body of my son is lying, I wish to acquaint myself with his final state. Alas! Under the decree of destiny he is lying lifeless on the earth, his body besmeared with blood, stripped of the deerskin formerly worn by him.\u2019", "\u201cO Kaushalya, taking the deeply distressed sage and his wife to that place, they, with their fingers touched the lifeless body of their son. Approaching the place, they embraced the dead body of their child, the father crying:", "\u2018O Child, you are to-day not bidding us welcome, nor dost you speak to me. Why art you lying on the earth, art you displeased? O My Son, if you are angry with me, regard your virtuous mother. Why dost you not embrace me and speak tender words to me? Now that half the night has gone, who will read the Scriptures and Puranas in gentle accents to me? O My Son, who will perform our morning ablutions and after offering up his morning devotions, serve and console us? Helpless and destitute, who will gather roots, berries and fruits for me in the forest, and feed me, like a beloved guest? O My Son, how shall I nourish and support your mother, blind, ascetic and devoted to her son? O My Child, stay, stay, do not yet enter the abode of Yama. To-morrow your mother and I will accompany you. Without you we are distressed, helpless and bereft of support, we will accompany you to the abode of Yama. Beholding the Lord of Death, we shall say to him, \u201cForgive our transgressions of the past which have caused us to be separated from our son and let him yet be our support. Grant us this blessing, O Lord of Death, and make us free from fear. You are just and the renowned protector of your realm? O My Son, you are innocent and hast been slain by a sinful man, therefore, by the power of truth, enter you the abode of heroes. Go, my son to that high state attained by those who follow truth and suffer death at the hands of their foes, without retreating. Go to that high region attained by Sagara, Shivya, Dilipa, Janamejaya, Nahusha and Dhundhumara. That state attained by those versed in the Veda and practising austerity, be thine. That state, O My Son, of those who attend the sacred fire, of those highly generous persons who make gifts of land in charity, may that state acquired by those who give thousands of cows in charity and serve their Guru single mindedly, or those courting death by fire in meditation, be thine. None born of your family has ever descended to a lower state but he who has slain our son shall end in misery\u201d.\u2019", "\u201cThus for a long time wailing in distress, the aged parents began to offer ceremonial water for their dead son. The son of that sage by virtue of his meritorious deeds ascending to heaven in a celestial form, in the company of Indra addressed his parents with consoling words, saying:", "\u2018By virtue of my services to you, I have obtained this state, you, too, will soon join me here.\u2019", "Thereafter, that self-controlled ascetic ascended to heaven in an aerial chariot. O Lady, that great sage with his wife performing the water ritual, said to me standing near with joined palms:", "\u2018O King, now put an end to my life also, I shall feel no grief in dying. This was my only son and by slaying him you have rendered me childless. As he was slain by you, I pronounce a curse on you. Mayest you suffer the the same grief that you have caused to me, through separation from your son, ending in your death. O King, having slain the sage unknowingly, the guilt of killing a brahmin will not be thine. As the dispenser of charity receives the merit of those gifts, so will you suffer in the degree of the suffering you have caused me, putting an end to your life.\u2019", "\u201cO Queen, having cursed me, they lamented for some time and then gathering wood, kindled a fire, and entering it, departed this life. O Lady, to-day recalling that evil deed, committed thoughtlessly in my youth, by discharging the arrow by sound, the fruit of my action has overtaken me, as illness follows the partaking of unwholesome food. O Noble Lady, the time of the fulfilment of the sage\u2019s curse has come.\u201d", "Having said this, the king weeping and overcome with fear on the approach of death, spoke again: \u201cO Kaushalya, I am about to yield up my life through grief for my son, I am unable to see you, do you draw near and touch me. Those about to enter the abode of death distinguish nought. If Rama could but touch me for an instant, or receive my wealth and the regency, I might yet live. O Auspicious Lady, I have not dealt justly with Rama, but what he has done to me is right. What thoughtful man would abandon even a sinful son? But what son, sent into exile will not think ill of his father? O Kaushalya, I no longer behold you, my memory is also fading. O Queen, the messengers of death call on me to depart; what affliction is greater than this, that at the hour of death I do not behold the virtuous Rama, the hero of truth? The grief caused by the absence of my son, who never opposed my wishes, dries up my life as heat dries up water. They are not men, they are gods, who will look on that lovely countenance of lotus eyes and charming features after fourteen years! Blessed are those who will behold the face of Rama resembling the full moon, returning to Ayodhya. Fortunate are they who will behold Rama in the capital like the planet Shukra, completing its course in the heavens. O Kaushalya, my heart is breaking, I have lost the sense of touch, taste and sound. When the mind expires, the senses are extinguished as the flame of a lamp subsides when the oil is consumed. O Grief, you are destroying me and carrying away my life as a river bears away the banks by its force! O Prince, O Mighty Hero, O Sole Remover of my pain, O Darling of Your Sire, O My Master, My Son, where art you? O Kaushalya, O Virtuous Sumitra, I depart! O My Cruel Enemy Kaikeyi, destroyer of my family\u2019s felicity.\u201d", "Thus lamenting, the king died in the presence of Rama\u2019s mother and the Queen Sumitra.", "Overborne by the grief caused by the exile of his son, that generous and mighty king, at midnight, yielded up his life.", "The night having passed, at dawn, according to custom, the bards arrived at the palace of the king, the traditional singers, those versed in rhetoric and in the history of the dynasty, and skilled musicians acquainted with rhythm and melody, began to sing the praises of the king. The sound of their eulogies and their songs filled the whole palace. Others uttering tributes and clapping their hands recited the monarch\u2019s wonderful deeds. The birds in the trees near the palace and those confined in cages awoke and sang. Their notes mingled with the salutations of the brahmins, the music of the vinas, the chanting of the holy names of God and the praises of those describing the great deeds of the king. Eunuchs and servants stood near, ready to serve, as was their wont. Those who attended to the ablutions of the king, brought water scented with fragrant perfumes, in pitchers of gold. Charming and well-attired men and women came with oil, unguents, mirrors, combs, towels and other articles and all that was needed by the king was provided according to custom. Till sunrise, all awaited the king, then they addressed each other saying: \u201cHow is this, has his majesty not yet risen?\u201d Then the women, other than Kaushalya, who formerly attended on the king, began to waken their lord as was their usage. Having with affection and skill touched the body of the monarch, they found no sign of life in him. Then the women, knowing well the motion of the pulse and understanding the signs of sleep, began to tremble perceiving the king\u2019s condition. Fearing that the king no longer breathed, they shook like the narcal grass in the midst of a flowing stream, and slowly became aware that their sovereign had passed away.", "The Queens, Kaushalya and Sumitra, overcome with grief on account of the departure of their sons, lay as if dead. Suffering had rendered the chief queen pale and her body feeble. The two queens, their splendour dimmed by sorrow, resembled the stars hidden by douds.", "Seeing the two queens lying insensible and the king dead, the women wept aloud in distress.", "At the loud wailing of the attendant women, like female elephants bereft of their leader, Kaushalya and Sumitra came to themselves. Touching the body of the king and finding it cold, they fell senseless, crying: \u201cO, My Lord,\u201d \u201cO, My Lord.\u201d Lying on the earth, covered with dust, Queen Kaushalya resembled a star fallen from the skies.", "The king being dead, the ladies of the inner apartments beheld the queen lying on the ground like a female naga. The other consorts of the king with Kaikeyi, overcome with grief, fell unconscious to the earth.", "The wailing of the women within, and those who now followed them, filled the whole place. The royal dwelling, bereft of joy and filled with the sound of distress, was thronged with afflicted relatives and friends mourning and weeping. The queens stricken with grief, lamenting piteously, like orphans cleaving to their departed parent, clasped the arms of the mighty monarch.", "Kaushalya placed the head of the dead king, resembling an extinguished fire or a waterless ocean or the sun without lustre, on her lap and oppressed with grief, thus addressed Kaikeyi: \u201cO Kaikeyi, your ambition is fulfilled, now rule without further opposition. Having abandoned the king, enjoy the kingdom with your son, O You of Evil Conduct! Rama having departed and the king also, I resemble a traveller on a dangerous and difficult path bereft of his companions. There is no further joy in life for me! Alas! what woman bereft of her lord, her deity, desires to continue to live? Kaikeyi alone is such a one, having abandoned all virtue. The greedy disregard the consequences of their acts, like a hungry man devouring poisonous food without considering its effects. Alas I Kaikeyi has destroyed the dynasty of Raghu at the instigation of a hunchbacked woman! How bitterly will King Janaka mourn, on hearing that King Dasaratha, urged by Kaikeyi, has exiled Rama together with his consort. The lotus-eyed Rama, not knowing the king is dead, is unaware that I, to-day, am masterless and a widow! The daughter of King Janaka, the wretched Sita, unworthy of affliction will suffer intensely in the forest. Hearing the fearful roar of lions and tigers, in the dark night, she will cling in terror to Rama. The aged Janaka, whose only child is Sita, will assuredly die of grief, when acquainted with the sufferings inflicted on his daughter! I, to-day, in devotion to my lord, will enter the blazing fire embracing his body.\u201d", "Hearing these words, the chief minister, versed in the tradition, drew Queen Kaushalya away from the body of the king, and placing it in a vessel filled with oil, to preserve it, performed the requisite ceremonies. The counsellors acquainted with the time-honoured duties, were unwilling to cremate the body of the king in the absence of the prince. As the body was lowered into the oil-filled vessel, the women of the palace wept bitterly, exclaiming: \u201cAlas, the king is dead.\u201d Lifting up their arms, shedding tears and wailing pitiably, they cried: \u201cO King, having separated us from the sweet-speaking Rama, why hast you, too, abandoned us? How shall we live with the evil-minded Kaikeyi, who has exiled Rama and slain her lord? Alas! Shri Rama, the chief support of our life, has gone to the forest, relinquishing his royal portion. How can we live under the reproaches and tyranny of Kaikeyi in the absence of Rama and of you? Will not she who exiled Rama, the mighty Lakshmana and Sita and abandoned the king, abandon us also?\u201d", "Then the chief queens, the consorts of King Dasaratha, overwhelmed with sorrow, shedding tears, felt themselves bereft of all happiness. Like the night without a moon or a lovely and youthful woman bereft of her lord, the city of Ayodhya appeared stricken. Filled with men and women weeping and lamenting, the city was unswept, its ways unadorned! The great sovereign, having through grief at the separation from his son, given up his life, the queens wept lying on the ground, till the sun sank below the horizon and die dark night crept on.", "The friends and relatives of the monarch taking counsel together, being unwilling to cremate the body of the king, in the absence of his son, laid it, therefore, in a vessel of oil.", "The king being dead, the inhabitants of the city filled the streets and courts, mourning for their lord, causing Ayodhya to resemble the night bereft of stars. Men and women gathered together, inveighing against the mother of Bharata, Queer Kaikeyi. All were distraught and bereft of joy!", "[Full title: The elders recommend that a member of the house of Ikshvaku be appointed king].", "To the inhabitants of the city, lamenting and weeping, the night was as a high mountain, scaled with difficulty. The sun having risen, the brahmin advisers to the kingdom came together in the royal assembly, even those illustrious ones, Markandeya, Vamadeva, Kasyapa, Gautama, Katyayana and Javali.", "These renowned sages, together with the ministers, taking their seat in the presence of Vasishtha the excellent and chief priest, declared their mind, saying:", "\u201cThe past night has been like a hundred years to us. Afflicted, on account of his son\u2019s departure, the king has given up his life. The king is dead and Shri Rama has entered the forest, together with the mighty Lakshmana. The Princes Bharata and Shatrughna are in the the capital of the kingdom of their maternal grandfather. A member of the House of Ikshvaku must be appointed king lest the country fall into ruin. On a kingdom destitute of a ruler, clouds charged with lightning and thunder pour down rain and hail! In a rulerless land, the peasants sow no grain; fathers and sons oppose each other and wives no longer remain subject to their husbands! In a rulerless land, there is no peace, thieves and brigands exercise their power; women, unfaithful to their consorts, leave their homes! Where women lose their virtue, trust is also lost. In a rulerless land, there are no assemblies, nor do the people visit pleasant parks and gardens or build temples and homes of rest. In such a land, the self-controlled brahmins offer no sacrifice nor do those of pious vows, assist them in the sacred rite. In a rulerless land, the brahmins do not receive their due share of the sacrificial fees; neither do actors nor leaders of song or dance find joy in such a land. The holy festivals promoting the land\u2019s prosperity are no longer held, nor do those reciting the holy tradition give satisfaction to their hearers. In a rulerless land, virgins adorned with golden ornaments, do not frequent the flower gardens at close of day, nor do the devotees of pleasure, riding swift chariots in company with charming damsels, repair to the forest. In such a land, the wealthy are not protected, nor does the husbandman, the cowherd and the shepherd sleep at ease with open doors. In a rulerless land, great elephants of sixty years of age do not wander on the royal highways adorned with tinkling bells. The twanging of the archer\u2019s bow is no longer heard, nor do the merchants travelling the roads in security bring their goods to sell from distant lands. In a rulerless land, the self-controlled sage, fixing his mind, in contemplation, on his identity with the all-pervading spirit, receives no hospitality when night falls. Wealth is not unassailable, nor are man\u2019s needs supplied, the armies have no leaders, nor can they match the enemy in war. In a rulerless country, no man, gorgeously apparelled, riding in an excellent chariot, drawn by swift steeds, can go forth without fear; nor can the learned disputant propound his doctrines in the city or forest. In such a land, garlands and sweetmeats, alms or other gifts, are not offered by worshippers as a sacrifice, nor in the springtime, do the princes, like blossoming trees, adorned with sandalwood and ambergris, walk abroad. A kingdom without a sovereign is like a river without water, a forest without vegetation, or a cow without a keeper. As a chariot is known by its standard, as a fire is indicated by smoke, so the king, a light representing the kingdom, has been extinguished. No man loves his own kind in a rulerless land, but each slays and devours the other. Atheists and materialists, exceeding the limits of their caste, assume dominion over others, there being no king to exercise control over them. As the eyes continuously point out what is dangerous to the body, promoting its welfare, so the king ever regards the advantage of his people, promoting truth and ethical conduct. The king leads his people in the path of righteousness and guides them in integrity, he is the parent of his subjects and the greatest of benefactors. In the path of duty he excels even Yama, Kuvera, Indra and Varuna. The king, discerning good and evil, protects his kingdom; bereft of him, the country is enveloped in darkness. O Holy Vasishtha, while the king lived, we obeyed your mandates as the sea keeps within its boundaries. O Great Brahmin, consider our words and the danger threatening this, our kingdom, and appoint someone as king if he be of the house of Ikshvaku.\u201d", "Shri Vasishtha, having heard the pronouncement of the ministers and brahmins, said: \u201cThe king has bequeathed the kingdom to Bharata, who, with his brother abides happily in the house of his maternal uncle, therefore, dispatch swift messengers speedily, to bring back the two princes. This and naught else should be done.\u201d", "Then all said: \u201cBe it so, O Lord.\u201d", "Vasishtha then said to Siddartha, Vijaya, Jayanta, Asoka and Nandana: \u201cCome hither and attend to what I command you to do: On swift steeds set out for the city of Rajagraha and, concealing all signs of grief, thus address Prince Bharata The holy priest Shri Vasishtha and his counsellors salute you and inform you that an urgent matter awaits your attention in the capital", "\u201cHave a care not to disclose to him the fall of the Raghu dynasty nor speak of Rama\u2019s exile or the king\u2019s death. Take with you silken robes and excellent gems for the King of Kaikeya and for Prince Bharata, and depart without delay.\u201d", "The messengers received the commands of Shri Vasishtha and taking provision for the journey went to their own houses. Then mounting swift horses, accustomed to prolonged travel, they started for the kingdom of Kaikeya. Having taken leave of the holy Guru, equipped with provisions, they departed in haste. Their course, along the bank of the Malini, lay south between the Uparathala mountain and north of Pralamba. They crossed the sacred Ganges at Hastinapura and proceeded westward arriving in Pancala (the Punjab) by way of Kuru Jangula. On the way, they beheld many lakes filled with limpid water and translucent streams and passing speedily onwards, reached the river Sharadanda, full of pure water and frequented by many species of waterfowl.", "On the bank of that river grew the sacred tree Satyapayachan, to which the messengers made obeisance and then entered the city of Kalinga. Passing through the village of Abikala, they crossed the river Ikshumati issuing from the mountain Bodhibhavana, a territory formerly belonging to the House of Ikshvaku. There the messengers drank the water of the river from the palms of their hands and encountered certain brahmins versed in the Veda.", "Traversing the land of Vahlika, they descried the mountain Sudamana which bore the marks of the Feet of Vishnu, and duly worshipped it. They beheld the rivers Vipasha and Shalmali and many pools, lakes and reservoirs. Proceeding further on their journey, according to the instructions of their master, they saw lions, tigers, elephants and various other beasts.", "After a long period, the horses became fatigued, but the messengers pressed on to the town of Giribraja in the kingdom of Kaikeya. For the sake of performing the will of their lord and to preserve the royal dynasty and the honour of the House of Dasaratha, without relaxing their pace, the messengers entered the city at nightfall.", "On the night the messengers reached the city, Prince Bharata had a most inauspicious dream. Seeing that evil dream, the son of the emperor, when the night ended, was much distressed. His intimate friends, the companions of his own age, seeing him in distress, spoke pleasing words in the assembly and related humorous traditions to distract his mind. Some played on vinas for his entertainment, others danced, acted and narrated stories.", "Despite the endeavours of his amiable companions, Prince Bharata remained melancholy. At length, they addressed him, saying: \u201cO Friend, we have tried in vain to entertain you, why dost you not smile?\u201d", "Bharata replied: \u201cHear the cause of my sadness. In a dream, I saw my father in faded apparel, his hair dishevelled, falling from a mountain peak into a pit of cow dung. There, I saw that great king, wallowing like a frog and drinking oil from the palms of his hands; afterwards, I beheld him eating rice mixed with sesamum seed, his body besmeared with oil, he being immersed in it. Again, in that dream, I saw the sea dry up and the moon fall on the earth and the world plunged in darkness. The tusks of the royal elephants were broken in pieces and a blazing fire was suddenly extinguished. I saw the earth rent and the leaves of the trees wither and the mountains riven and emit smoke. I beheld the king on an iron seat, clad in black and women attired in black and yellow mocking him. That virtuous king, adorned with sandalwood paste, wearing garlands of red flowers, seated in a chariot drawn by asses went southwards. I saw a female demon of monstrous shape clothed in red deriding the king. This fearful vision has been seen by me. Either myself or Rama or the king or Lakshmana will surely die. When, in a dream, one is seen riding in a chariot drawn by asses, the smoke of his funeral pyre will soon ascend. On this account, I am distraught, nought gives me joy, my throat is choked and my mind confused. I see no reason for fear, yet I am apprehensive. I cannot speak or breathe, my body has lost its power, I am agitated and cannot control my distress. Never have I seen so threatening a dream! Reflecting on it, I am perturbed, fear has taken possession of my heart and I know not if I shall ever again behold the king.\u201d", "While Bharata was relating his dream, the messengers from Ayodhya, overcome with weariness, entered the city of Raja-grahapura within the impassable moat.", "Having approached the King of Kaikeya and the heir-apparent, Prince Yudhajita, and being received by them with due hospitality, they addressed Prince Bharata saying: \u201cThe chief priest, Shri Vasishtha and his counsellors send their greetings! Return speedily to Ayodhya, an urgent matter awaits your attention there. O Great Prince, taking these precious robes and jewelled ornaments sent to you, present them to your maternal uncle.\u201d", "Shri Bharata, accepting the gifts offered them to his maternal uncle with great affection, then making provision for the messengers and entertaining them duly, he afterwards said to them: \u201cO Messengers, is my father the king well? Is the great Ramacandra well, and my brother Prince Lakshmana? Is the Queen Kaushalya, the upholder of dharma, in good health? She who is virtuous and a patron of brahmins, who is ever to be worshipped, who is wise and the chief queen? Is the second of my father\u2019s queens, Sumitra the mother of Lakshmana and Shatrughna, well? And my mother Kaikeyi, self-willed, given to anger, arrogant and accounting herself wise, is it well with her? What message has she sent to me?\u201d", "The messengers thus addressed by Prince Bharata, answered with respect: \u201cO Lion among Men, those whose welfare is dear to you, are well. Prosperity awaits you, therefore, summon your chariot.\u201d", "Prince Bharata said: \u201cI will seek permission of the king to depart and inform him I must go without delay.\u201d", "Thus, dismissing the messengers, Prince Bharata approached his grandfather and said: \u201cYour Majesty, urged by the messengers, I wish to return to my father in haste, I will come again, when you are pleased to call me.\u201d", "King Kaikeya smelling the head of the prince, addressed him in comfortable words, saying: \u201cO Bharata, Kaikeyi is blessed in you, a virtuous son! Carry my greetings to your mother and father. Salute also the holy Sage Vasishtha, and the wise and pious brahmins in my name and greet the mighty warriors Rama and Lakshmana.\u201d", "King Kaikeya, then, bidding Bharata farewell, commending him, gave him great elephants and precious shawls, woollen cloths and deerskins. He gave him also with great veneration, much wealth, two thousand necklaces, coral and gold ornaments and sixteen hundred excellent horses. He sent also wise and trustworthy counsellors to attend him. Then Prince Yudhajita gave Bharata two stately elephants named Iravata and Indrasihra and many mules to transport his gifts. His unde gave him also certain fierce dogs, bred in the palace with large teeth equalling tigers in strength.", "Shri Bharata praised the gifts conferred on him and sought permission to leave without delay. His heart was heavy on account of his fearful dream and the urgency of the messengers.", "The prince came forth from the inner apartments of the palace and, surrounded by elephants and horses, stood on the royal highway. Entering the king\u2019s apartment, unchallenged, Shri Bharata bade farewell to all, then mounting his chariot with Prince Shatrughna, he started on his journey. Servants, horses, camels, bulls and mules followed the chariot of the prince. Escorted by the private counsellors of the king, together with the army, the patient and highly valiant Bharata together with Shatrughna left the palace fearlessly, as the perfected ones leave the region of Indra.", "That valiant and resplendent prince, turning eastward, came to the river Suddama, and passing over it, reached the broad Hladini and the Satali flowing westward. Having crossed over the river at Iladhana, he reached Parvata and the stream in which all objects thrown are petrified, then proceeding further he forded the Shalyakartana river. Then the righteous and truth loving prince ascended the mountains and crossed the river Shilavaha near the forest Citraratha, arriving at the confluence of the Ganges and Sarasvati, and traversing the land of Viramatsya, entered the Bharunda forest. At length, reaching the swift and joy-inspiring Kulinga river, which descends from the mountains, he crossed the Yamuna and allowed his army to rest. There, the weary horses were refreshed and his followers bathed and drank, taking water with them for future use on the way. Thereafter, Prince Bharata entered the uninhabited forest on a great Bhadra elephant, speedily traversing it. Finding they were unable to cross the Ganga at Unchudhana, they went to the place called Pragavata and crossing there passed over another river named Kutikoshtaka; then with his army, he reached the village of Dharmavardhana. Resting for a while at Varutha, the son of Dasaratha went towards the east to the wood called Ujjihana which was filled with kedumbra1 trees. Arriving at the groves of sala and bhanduka trees, Bharata, leaving his army to follow slowly, went forward with haste, halting at the village of Sarvatirtha. Then crossing the river Uttamika, he passed over several other streams with the help of mountain ponies. At Hastiprastaka, he crossed the river Kutika and at Lohitya, the Sukatavati. Arriving at the forest of Sahavana, having crossed the Sthanumati near Eksala, he traversed the Gaumati at Vinata. His horses being greatly fatigued by the journey, the prince halted the night at Salawan and at dawn beheld Ayodhya.", "Having spent seven nights on the way, seeing Ayodhya from a distance, the prince said to his charioteer: \u201cO Charioteer, this would appear to be the renowned and taintless city of Ayodhya abounding in green lawns, but at a distance it resembles a heap of yellow dust; formerly the sound of the recitation of the Veda was heard, intoned by the brahmins, and the city was frequented by royal sages. To-day, I do not hear the cheerful cries of men and women in pursuit of pleasure! The woods at eventide were formerly filled with people, running here and there in sport, but to-day they are deserted and silent. O Charioteer, this is not like Ayodhya to me, but seems to be a wilderness. None of the nobly born are seen coming and going in chariots or riding bn elephants and horses. The flower gardens were erstwhile filled with cheerful people and the orchards with those who made merry there! These gardens, once abounding in flowers and trees, with pleasant groves and arbours, to-day seem to mourn. I no longer hear the cry of deer or the birds singing with joy. O Friend, why do the breezes, redolent with the scent of sandalwood and ambergris, not blow as formerly, over the city? In the past, the sound of drums and the music of the Vina was heard by us, now all is silent! I see portentous signs and evil omens, my mind is heavy on account of these forebodings. O Charioteer, without apparent cause my heart beats fast and painfully, my mind is clouded, and apprehension freezes my senses.\u201d", "Entering the capital by the northern gate, his horses being overcome with weariness, the guards, enquiring as to his welfare, sought to accompany him on his way. But Bharata, sick at heart, declined their company, though with due deference.", "He said: \u201cO Charioteer, I behold the houses with their doors set open, bereft of splendour and emitting no fragrance of incense or sacrificial offering! Filled with unhappy people and those who are fasting, the houses are destitute of all splendour. No garlands hang from any dwelling and the courtyards lie neglected and unswept. The temples, without attendant priests, have lost their former splendour, none worship the gods and the sacrificial pavilions are deserted. The shops where formerly flowers were sold and other merchandise, are neglected, and the merchants appear dispirited and anxious over the cessation of their trade. Birds in the sacred groves seem joyless and men and women in soiled attire, weeping and lamenting, wasted with grief, roam about the city.\u201d", "Speaking thus to the charioteer and seeing the city\u2019s distress, Prince Bharata drove towards the palace. Beholding the capital once gay as Indra\u2019s city, with the roads and courts deserted and the houses covered with dust, he was overcome with anguish. Struck by these painful portents formerly unknown to him, Bharata, with bowed head, his heart filled with dread, entered bis father\u2019s palace.", "Not seeing his father in the palace, Bharata, desirous of beholding his mother, went to her apartment. Kaikeyi, seeing her son after a long absence, with a joyous heart, rose from her golden couch. Observing the apartment of his mother, divested of splendour, Bharata reverently touched her feet. She, having kissed the head of her son, embracing him again, seated him on her lap, and said: \u201cO Child! How many days have passed since you didst leave your grandfather\u2019s abode? Having journeyed in haste, I trust you are not fatigued? O Child, are your grandfather and uncle well? Tell me, O Dear One, hast you been in health since you have visited that other country?\u201d", "Shri Bharata thus questioned, by his mother, related all that had happened. He said: \u201cO Mother, seven days and seven nights have passed, since I left my grandfather\u2019s home. Both he and my unde are well. The parting gifts of wealth and gems which the King of Kaikeya gave me, I have left on the way, to follow me, the beasts of burden being weary! The messengers who conveyed the orders of the king, bade me return with all speed. Now, O Mother, answer what I would feign ask? Why is this, your golden couch, vacated by the king? Why do the king\u2019s subjects appear wretched? The king was wont to dwell principally in your palace, where is he to-day? I have come hither to enter his august presence! Where is my father now, I have come to offer salutations to his feet? Is he in the apartment of my chief mother, Queen Kaushalya?\u201d Kaikeyi, knowing all that had taken place but filled with ambition, answered Prince Bharata, as yet ignorant of the matter. Imparting the unpleasant news in honeyed accents, she said: \u201cThat fate, which inevitably overtakes all beings, has befallen that great soul, that renowned and mighty monarch the support of his people, your sire!\u201d", "The guileless Prince Bharata, born of a great family, hearing these words, overwhelmed by grief, instantly fell to the ground and falling striking his hands on the earth, cried: \u201cAlas! I am undone!\u201d That resplendent prince, deeply moved on learning of the death of his father, began to lament, crying: \u201cOn this couch, my father appeared like the moon in autumn, to-day on account of his absence, this pleasant bed resembles the sky bereft of stars or the ocean without water!\u201d", "Heaving deep sighs, weeping bitterly and covering his face with a cloth, the prince continued to mourn.", "Queen Kaikeyi, seeing Bharata lying on the ground, overwhelmed with sorrow, like the branch of a shala tree, severed by the blows of an axe, raised him up and said to her godlike son who resembled the moon, the sun or the elephant in splendour: \u201cO Son of a King 1 O Most Illustrious One! Rise! Rise! Pious men like you, do not thus yield to grief! O Wise One! As the radiance of the sun\u2019is fixed in that orb, so must you who art devoted to charity, sacrifice and good conduct and who follow the injunctions of the Vedas, be calm!\u201d", "Prince Bharata, rolling on the earth, wept for a long time and then answered his mother sorrowfully, saying: \u201cO Mother, thinking the king was undertaking a great sacrifice, having bestowed the throne on Shri Rama, I started for home with great joy, but now I see matters are otherwise and my mind is torn with anguish, since I no longer behold my ever magnanimous parent! O Mother, from what malady did the king suffer, that he was carried away in my absence? How fortunate are my brothers, Shri Rama and Lakshmana, who have performed the monarch\u2019s obsequies! If the great sovereign' had been aware of my return, would he not have bent his head and embraced me? Alas! Where is that royal hand, the touch of which filled me with delight and which cleansed my body from the dust? O Mother, where is my sagacious brother Rama, whose servant I am and who resembles my father? Tell me quickly where he may be found? Since my virtuous and enlightened brother has now become as a father to me, I desire to take refuge at his feet, he alone is my sole support! O Mother, what commands concerning me did the righteous and learned king, the ever-truthful monarch of firm vows, give? I desire to hear the last words of the great sovereign?\u201d", "Thus questioned, Queen Kaikeyi openly answered, saying: \u201cThe king, at the time of death, did not speak your name but cried \u2018O Rama, O Sita, O Lakshmana\u2019 and thus gave up his life! Your father, bound by the ties of fate and duty, like a mighty elephant, caught in ambush, uttered these words at the end: \u2018Those who see Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, returning from the forest, will attain their desire\u2019.\u201d", "As Kaikeyi revealed this unpleasant intelligence, the prince grew yet more distracted and enquired of his mother: \u201cO Mother, where is the virtuous Rama, where is he now with Sita and his brother Lakshmana?\u201d", "Thus questioned, the queen began to relate what had occurred, supposing the news of the unpleasing event would be welcome to her son.", "She said: \u201cO Child, that prince, clothed in robes of bark, has entered the great Dandaka forest with Sita and Lakshmana.\u201d", "Hearing from his mother that Rama had entered the forest, Prince Bharata was alarmed, filled with misgivings and concerned for the honour of his House. He said: \u201cO Mother, how is this? Has Shri Rama, without reason, slain any, either rich or poor? Or has he looked on the wife of another with desire? For what reason has Rama, versed in the scriptures, been exiled to the forest?\u201d", "Then the mother of Bharata, imbued with feminine qualities, capricious and calculating, began to relate the whole matter. Hearing her son\u2019s words, Kaikeyi, gratified, vainly imagining herself wise, said: \u201cMy Son, neither has Rama robbed a brahmin of his wealth, nor has he slain any, rich or poor, without reason, neither has Rama looked on another\u2019s wife with desire! My Son, having heard that he was to be proclaimed regent, I requested your father to banish Rama and bestow the kingdom on you! Your sire, in order to honour the promise made to me, fulfilled my request. He sent Rama, together with Sita and Lakshmana to the forest. Then that mighty monarch, unable to endure the separation from his son, died. O Righteous Prince, now do you rule the kingdom! For your sake, I have contrived all this! My Son, do not grieve, do not afflict thyself, the kingdom and the capital, being now without a ruler, depend on you for support. Therefore, seeking advice from Shri Vasishtha and the learned brahmins, perform the funeral rites of your great sire and, without hesitation, accept the throne!\u201d", "Hearing of the death of his father and the exile of his brothers, Prince Bharata, deeply afflicted, answered Queen Kaikeyi:", "\u201cWhat will the throne avail me, since I am stricken by the death of my father and bereft of my brother, who was as a parent to me? You have destroyed the king, and banished Rama, causing him to become an ascetic! You have thus rubbed salt into the wounds which you have inflicted! You have entered this royal House for its extinction, like the night of death! My father, unaware that you were an all-consuming fire, supported you. O Sinful One, you have deprived the king of life! O You Destroyer of the Family, overpowered with avarice, you have shattered the peace of the hearth. Through union with you, my father, a lover of truth, has suffered untold misery and grief! Wherefore hast you slain my virtuous sire? Wherefore hast you exiled Rama? Hard indeed were it to live with such a mother! How will Kaushalya and Sumitra now endure life? My elder brother, Shri Ramacandra, ever devoted to his duty and to the service of his Guru, treated you as his own mother. So also my elder mother, Queen Kaushalya, knowing what would befall, yet acted towards you as a true sister, in a proper spirit. You have sent her son to the forest in ascetic\u2019s garb and still you dost not grieve? What hast you gained by sending that renowned hero, Rama, to the forest, Rama, who was unacquainted with suffering? Were you ignorant of my great love for Raghava, that you, possessed by avarice, committed this great sin, O Mother? By what power can I rule, deprived of Lakshmana and that Lion among men, Shri Rama? King Dasaratha ever depended on that mighty and valorous Rama, as the forest depends on Mount Meru! How can I sustain the burden of the kingdom, without the support of Rama? How should a calf sustain the load that taxes the strength of a full-grown bull? Even if it were possible for me to rule through wisdom and sound policy, yet would I not allow your evil intention in seeking the kingdom for your son, to prevail! I should have abandoned you, O Mother, did I not know that Rama regards you as his mother also! O You Evil-minded One, you have brought disgrace on the dynasty of my ancestors! How didst you conceive such a purpose, bringing shame into our lives? It is the immemorial custom of our House, that the eldest brother shall occupy the throne and the younger brothers obey him. You are not acquainted with the duty of a king nor dost you know the rules of government. In the House of Ikshvaku, the succession of the eldest son is enjoined. To-day, you have cast into the dust the glory and integrity of the House of Ikshvaku, that was enriched by the noble conduct of its kings! You, too, were born of a renowned and royal House, how earnest you to entertain this evil intention? O Mother, let it be known to you that I will never fulfil your evil desires, come what may, since you have introduced that which is destructive of life into this royal House! I shall now bring my sinless brother, Rama, back to the capital and thwart you! Not only will I cause Rama to return from the forest, but I will serve him with my whole heart!\u201d", "Thus reproaching Kaikeyi, himself afflicted, with harsh words, Bharata spoke once more, roaring like a lion in the caves of the Mandara mountain.", "[Full title: Prince Bharata laments the death of his father and the exile of Shri Rama].", "Shri Bharata denounced his mother in great anger, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Cruel-hearted One, O Wicked Being, you are without virtue, enter the forest, I am about to die 1 Weep for me; since you have deserted your consort, do not mourn for him. Tell me, what harm had the king or the most virtuous Rama done to you, that you have slain the one and exiled the other? O Kaikeyi, the sin by which you have destroyed the dynasty is equal to the murder of a brahmin! Do you enter hell! You have no right to inhabit the region to which the king has gone! Your deed and guilt are infamous. In denouncing Rama, who is beloved of all the world, you have secured me a kingdom, but brought me ignominy. You are the cause of my father\u2019s death and the exile of Rama, and also of my dishonour. Your heart is adamant, you are not my mother but an enemy in the form of a mother! O Slayer of your husband, you dost not merit that one should address you! O Defamer of the fair name of this dynasty, you are the cause of distress to my mothers, Queen Kaushalya and Sumitra! You have forfeited the title of daughter to the great King Ashvapati; you are surely a demon born in that family to destroy my father\u2019s line! You have banished Rama to the forest, he, who ever delighted in virtue and you have deprived my illustrious father of his life! It is I who must bear the weight of thine iniquity, who am fatherless, bereft of my two brothers and an object of universal loathing! O You Sinner, O Traveller on the path of self-destruction, say what state shalt you attain, who hast deprived the virtuous Kaushalya of her husband and her son? O Evil One, didst you not know that Shri Rama was the chief asylum of his relatives, the son of Kaushalya and a father to me? All relatives are dear, but to a mother, the son is dearest, since he is born of the body and heart of the father. Hast you forgotten this truth?\u201d", "In ancient times, the cow Kamadhenu, worshipped by the gods, beholding two of her sons, weary with ploughing, swooned away. At that time, the King of the Celestials, Indra, was wandering on the earth and the fragrant tears of Kamadhenu fell upon him. Experiencing the sweet odour issuing from the body of the sacred cow, Indra realised her superior worth and startled, looked upward and beheld, in the sky, the afflicted Kamadhenu, weeping piteously. The Bearer of the Mace, distressed on seeing the renowned Kamadhenu shedding tears, addressed her with humility and said: \u201cO Benefactor of the World, why dost you weep? Is it the premonition of some future calamity which causes you to lament thus?\u201d", "The wise Kamadhenu, patiently answered: \u201cO Devaraj, you have no cause for fear, I am afflicted on account of the suffering of two of my sons. See, how wretched they are, how wasted and oppressed by the sun\u2019s heat! O Devaraj! The ploughman has struck them cruelly! Born of my body, I am filled with grief to see them yoked to the heavy plough! Verily nothing is dearer to a mother than her son.\u201d", "Indra, perceiving that the cow mourned over the wretched state of two of her innumerable sons, recognised that to a mother nothing is dearer than a son!", "\u201cO Mother, Kamadhenu extends her blessings equally to all and has the power to fulfil the desires of others. If she, who is constantly producing thousands of offspring, filled with maternal love, mourns thus for two sons, how then, O Kaikeyi, will Kaushalya bear the exile of her only son? You have brought about the separation of Rama from his mother Kaushalya and for this you shalt not know happiness in this or in the other world! I shall perform the last rites for my sire and then, with my heart and soul serve my brother and carefully promote his honour. Having brought back Shri Rama to the capital, I, myself, shall inhabit the forest. O You, of evil intent, how shall I endure thine iniquity, when looked on by the people of the capital with sorrow-stricken gaze? Now it befits you to enter the fire or hang thyself in the Dandaka forest, death alone is your desert! Only when Rama returns and that Prince of Truth is by my side, shall I find peace and my purpose be accomplished!\u201d", "Bharata, lamenting and breathing like a serpent, fell to the earth like an elephant tormented by the goad. His eyes red with anger, his dress loosened, his jewels cast aside, he fell like the banner of Indra, uprooted at the close of a ceremony.", "The valiant Bharata, regaining consciousness, his eyes suffused with tears, perceived his mother filled with distress. Seated in the midst of his counsellors, he poured forth reproaches on his mother saying: \u201cIt was never my desire to rule, nor did I consult my mother in this matter; I was not acquainted with the king\u2019s intention to confer the crown on Rama, being far from the capital with Shatrughna. I knew nought of the exile of Shri Rama, Lakshmana and Sita, nor how it came to pass. My heart is filled with anguish.\u201d", "Kaushalya, hearing the sound of Bharata\u2019s weeping, said to Sumitra: \u201cBharata, the son of the cruel Kaikeyi, has come, I wish to see the prudent Bharata.\u201d", "The queen, pale and weak on account of her separation from Rama, advanced trembling to where Bharata was, while the prince with his brother Shatrughna started likewise for the apartment of the queen. The two brothers beheld the wretched queen proceeding with tottering footsteps and were filled with distress. Bowing down to Kaushalya, they wept bitterly, then the chief queen embraced Bharata sobbing with grief and said: \u201cIt was your desire to rule and your cruel mother has accomplished this matter without hindrance, but for what reason has this pitiless queen sent my son to the forest in ascetic\u2019s garb? Let Queen Kaikeyi banish me also to that region where my illustrious and golden-complexioned Rama abides! If not, I will go together with Sumitra to where Rama dwells, preceded by the sacrificial fire. O Bharata, do you take me to where my son, that lion among men, in great affliction is practising asceticism. Queen Kaikeyi has made you sovereign of this country, replete with wealth, grain, horses, elephants and chariots.\u201d", "Hearing the bitter words of Queen Kaushalya, Bharata was pained as a man who suffers when his wound is probed by a lancet. Agitated and confused, he fell at the feet of the queen lamenting.

Why dost you reproach me? May he, who is the cause of the exile of Rama, forget the teachings of the Vedas and the holy tradition. May he, who has given his consent to the exile of Rama, become a slave of the lowest caste or incur the sin of killing a cow. May such a man be subject to the same punishment as one who withholds the wages of his labourers. May he who has consented to the banishment of the holy prince, bear the same guilt as one rebelling against a king, who protects his subjects as his own offspring!

May he, by whom Rama was sent into exile, die without marrying a woman of his own caste or producing offspring or performing the fire ritual! May he not behold the offspring born of his spouse! May his years be brief! May he be slain in battle, retreating from a superior foe in fear, or may he be as one who slays a fleeing enemy.

May he be like one who defiles a reservoir or administers poison to another!

Assuredly you will enter the region attained by the blest.\u201d", "Then the queen, taking the mighty-armed prince in her lap, wept aloud.", "The prince whose heart was rent with grief also wept in an excess of sorrow.

O Mighty Ruler, this earth is widowed and divested of all beauty without you!

Scattering golden coins, and silver flowers and laying cloths before the bier, they proceeded on their way, while before the palace, sandalwood, ambergris and incense were kindled.", "On the banks of the river Sarayu, a funeral pyre of devadaru, sandal and other fragrant woods, was raised. Aromatic herbs were thrown on the pyre and the body of the king laid upon it.

Perceiving Bharata, overcome with grief, Shatrughna, remembering his sire, also fell senseless to the ground.", "Being somewhat restored, they called to mind the excellent qualities of their illustrious father and Shatrughna cried: \u201cThe boons exacted by Manthara are the ocean inhabited by the crocodile Kaikeyi, in which we are submerged. O Father, where art you gone, abandoning your tender and beloved son Bharata? Why hast you abjured us, you who wast wont to give us delicious food, fitting gifts, robes and ornaments? Who will now confer these favours on us? Why is the earth not riven, thus deprived of an illustrious and pious sovereign? Alas!

I shall not return to the capital, I shall go to Tapovana.\u201d", "The palace attendants hearing the prince grieving so bitterly, were afflicted and fell to the ground, tormented like bulls whose horns are broken.", "Then the excellent and wise Vasishtha, their father\u2019s chief priest raising Bharata up, addressed him, saying: \u201cO Prince, thirteen days have passed since the cremation of your illustrious father\u2019s body. Do not delay longer, but collect the bones that remain. Every man suffers the three pairs of opposites; hunger and thirst, pleasure and pain, life and death. Do not permit thyself to grieve for that which cannot be avoided.\u201d", "Then the wise Sumantra raised up Shatrughna and consoling him explained the nature of birth and death that visits all beings. Standing erect, those two lions among men, their eyes red with much weeping, resembled the standards of Indra, bereft of glory by the effects of sun and rain. Then the counsellors approached the two princes and requested them to undertake the remaining ceremonies.", "As Bharata, still grieving, was considering how he should approach Shri Rama in the forest, Prince Shatrughna spoke: \u201cO Brother, how is it that Shri Rama, the support of all beings in distress and who is powerful, has been banished to the forest with his consort? -Even if Shri Rama were bewildered, why did the mighty and courageous Lakshmana not defend him and restrain his father? The king, falling under the sway of desire, forsook the precepts of justice, Prince Lakshmana who was acquainted with what was right, should have restrained the king from this sinful act.\u201d", "While Prince Shatrughna was conversing thus with Bharata, the hunchback Manthara, attired in costly garments, adorned with precious gems, appeared at the east door. Painted thickly with sandalwood paste, wearing a robe and ornaments befitting a queen, bestowed on her by Kaikeyi, her waist encircled by a jewelled girdle, her whole body covered with precious stones, she resembled a captive monkey. The guards seeing that wicked and deformed slave, seized her and said to Prince Shatrughna: \u201cThis is the sinful wretch who has caused the exile of Shri Rama and the death of the king; deal with her according to your pleasure.\u201d", "On hearing the words of the guards, the prince smarting with indignation, reflected on his duty and said to those in the palace: \u201cLet this woman, the cause of the grief of my brothers and the death of my father, suffer the consequence of her acts.\u201d", "Shatrughna then seized Manthara from amidst her companions with such violence that her shrieks filled the palace! The women, perceiving Shatrughna so enraged, dealing thus with the hunchback, ran away in all directions. They reflected among themselves, saying: \u201cThe enraged prince will surely put an end to us all, let us therefore take refuge with the compassionate, liberal and illustrious Queen Kaushalya, she alone will protect us.\u201d", "Prince Shatrughna, the conqueror of his foes, his eyes red with anger threw Manthara on the ground and forcibly dragged her hither and thither, while all her ornaments were scattered, causing the palace to look like the autumn sky, studded with stars! Dragging Manthara in anger before Queen Kaikeyi, who sought to deliver her, the prince reproached his mother with bitter words. Pained by the harsh speech of Prince Shatrughna, the terrified Kaikeyi fled to Prince Bharata for protection.", "Perceiving Shatrughna overcome by anger, Bharata addressed him saying: \u201cO Brother, women are not to be slain by any living being, therefore pardon her and set her free! If women were subject to the law of retribution, and were it not that Rama would forsake me as a matricide, I would have slain this sinful woman long since! If Shri Rama became acquainted with our treatment of this deformed woman, he would never converse more with us.\u201d", "Thus instructed by Prince Bharata, Shatrughna restrained his wrath and released Manthara, who fell at the feet of Queen Kaikeyi, panting and lamenting. Perceiving Manthara full of fear under Shatrughna\u2019s displeasure and trembling like an imprisoned krauncha bird, Kaikeyi gradually calmed her.", "Early on the fourteenth day, the king\u2019s ministers being assembled, thus addressed Prince Bharata: \u201cOur Venerable Sovereign, King Dasaratha, having sent his eldest son, Shri Rama and the mighty Prince Lakshmana, into exile, has, himself, joined the circle of the gods. You are to-day our Lord, O Mighty Prince. The kingdom is now rulerless and the king bequeathed it to you, it is not improper for you, therefore, to ascend the throne, nor will any censure you on this account.", "O Prince of the House of Raghu, all the articles for your coronation are made ready; your relatives, counsellors and ministers and the citizens look to you. O Great Prince, accept the kingdom of your paternal ancestors and cause thyself to be installed and protect us all.\u201d", "The Speaker of Truth, the illustrious Bharata, hearing these excellent words, reverently circumambulating the articles designed for the coronation ceremony, replied to those who thus addressed him: \u201cHear, O My People, it is known to you that according to the tradition of our Royal House the throne is inherited by the eldest son of the deceased sovereign; it is, therefore, improper for you to make this request to me. Shri Rama is my elder brother and, therefore, should be king. I shall enter the forest and reside there during fourteen years in his stead. Now order my whole army to hold itself in readiness, I will go to the forest and bring my brother back, taking with me all the articles necessary for his installation. Rama will there be proclaimed king! I will restore him like the holy fire which is brought to the place of sacrifice. I will never suffer the ambitions of Queen Kaikeyi to be fulfilled. I will enter the forest, hard to penetrate, and shall make Rama king. Let the rough and uneven roads at once be repaired by skilled artisans; let them be followed by mechanics and labourers.\u201d", "The people were gratified to hear the auspicious words of the prince and replied: \u201cO Prince, may the Goddess of Prosperity ever abide with you! Desirous of making Rama our king, your words are timely.\u201d", "Then all present experienced great joy and shed tears of delight. The happy courtiers, ministers and servants spoke cheerfully, saying: \u201cO Chief of Men, at your command we are summoning the workmen to prepare the way.\u201d", "Now, commanded by Prince Bharata, water diviners, expert and industrious mechanics, builders of bridges, wheelwrights, men able to perform all kinds of work, woodcutters, artisans skilled in the sinking of wells, labourers, hewers of wood, cooks and those acquainted with the way, set forth. The multitude of people advancing, appeared astonishing, like the sea under the full moon.", "Those proficient in various ways, equipped with axes and other implements, advanced in groups, cutting through trees, shrubs, bushes and rocks, levelling them and hewing out a path; planting trees where these were needed, they cut back the branches of others that obstructed the way. Strong men set fire to tree trunks and cleared the road, levelling the uneven places with clay and filling the ditches. Others bridged the small rivers and brooks and swept the road clear of pebbles and thorns, pulverizing the rocks that impeded the flow of water. They speedily built barriers to dam the small streams and deepened the ponds by digging in many places. They also sank wells where water was scarce, and built platforms on which men could rest. Lime was spread on the road, trees were planted where birds sang and the highway appeared as if adorned with banners. Sprinkled with the essence of sandalwood and decorated with flowering branches, it resembled the pathvay of the Gods.", "Those skilled in building prepared dwellings on pleasant sites near fresh water and fruit trees. Camps were set up for the army in accordance with Prince Bharata\u2019s instructions and all that was needed was provided.", "Those acquainted with the auspicious planetary positions erected quarters for the illustrious Bharata. Bordered by deep moats with intersecting roads, these camps were as lofty as the blue mountain.", "Stately white temples were set up, and rows of houses, bordering the roads, were adorned with flags.", "The balconies on the buildings, elevated like dovecotes, resembled the abode of the gods, and the whole arena rivalled Indra\u2019s capital.", "The way prepared for Prince Bharata, extended to the banks of the Ganges in whose cool waters fishes glided, as it flowed between woods and forests, and that royal highway, erected by skilled artisans, appeared as beautiful as the night sky, adorned by moon and stars.", "Yet a little of the enchanting night still remained, when the bards began to praise the prince; three hours before the sun rose, the great drums were struck with golden sticks, while conches were blown and the sound of countless musical instruments was heard.", "The music filling the heavens increased the grief of Prince Bharata, who commanded it to cease, saying: \u201cI am not the king.\u201d Then addressing Prince Shatrughna, he said: \u201cHear, O Brother, how unfitting are the praises now sung at the instance of Queen Kaikeyi. She has done us a great wrong. The king has departed to the regions of the gods and left me desolate. The future and the kingdom trembling in uncertainty, resembles a ship without a pilot drifting on the ocean. My father is dead and my mother, abandoning the path of virtue, has sent Shri Rama into exile.\u201d", "The women of the palace, hearing the great prince lamenting, began to weep aloud pitifully. At this time, the great and illustrious Sage Vasishtha, versed in the science of government, appeared in the assembly hall, which was decorated with wrought gold, encrusted with gems. Attended by his followers, the spiritual preceptor of the royal dynasty, entered the council chamber, as Indra enters the celestial hall named Sudharma. Seated on a golden throne, which was covered with an excellent carpet with the svastika design, Shri Vasishtha said to the messengers: \u201cGo speedily and summon the learned brahmins, the counsellors, the warriors and the leaders of the army; matters of great importance await them 1 Bring also the royal princes together with their secretaries and ministers, Yudhajita and Sumantra!\u201d", "A great tumult now arose from those invited, who approached in chariots and on horses and elephants.", "The counsellors seeing Prince Bharata drawing near, were gladdened by his sight as though King Dasaratha himself had entered the assembly.", "The presence of Bharata added to the splendour of the court so that it appeared as when King Dasaratha was present, or as the clear waters of the ocean are enhanced by whales, alligators, shells and golden sand.", "The wise Bharata beheld the royal assembly presided over by the great Vasishtha and other venerable sages, resembling the night made glorious by the full moon. Illumined by these excellent ones, who occupied their seats, attired in splendid apparel, the conclave was of incomparable brilliance. The assembly of learned men resembled the beauty of the full moon on a winter\u2019s night.", "The virtuous priest, Shri Vasishtha, beholding all the ministers and the chief counsellors, gently addressed Bharata, saying: \u201cO Child, King Dasaratha, having practised virtue in his life, has bequeathed this rich and prosperous land to you. Shri Ramacandra observing the vow of truth, in obedience to his father and in conformity with the duty incumbent on him, to vindicate his parents, has not failed to accomplish his father\u2019s command, as the moon does not abstain from shedding abroad its radiance. Now enjoy the possession of this peaceful kingdom given to you by your father and brother! To please your counsellors, cause thyself to be installed. The kings of the north, south and west, the peers and titular sovereigns of the western boundary and the monarchs of many islands, will bring you countless gems as offerings.\u201d", "Hearing the words of his spiritual preceptor, Prince Bharata was distressed, knowing well that according to the ancient tradition of his dynasty, the eldest son inherits the kingdom. Calling Rama to remembrance, Shri Bharata resolved to seek out his elder brother. The throat of the youthful prince was choked and in tones resembling the cry of the swan, he plaintively reproached the venerable Guru for the impropriety of his command.", "Bharata said: \u201cO Holy Lord, how can I usurp the legitimate possession of one, who, learned in the Vedas and sciences, acquired by dwelling as a servant in the house of his Guru, knows their meaning well and follows them in practice? How can one, born of King Dasaratha, striving to fulfil the law of dharma, take possession of the kingdom of Rama? Not only does the kingdom belong to Rama, but I also belong to him. O Holy One, may your counsels accord with righteousness j King Dasaratha owned this kingdom as did King Dilipa and Nahusha before him, so should the virtuous Prince Rama, the eldest and most excellent son, inherit the kingdom!", "\u201cIf, as instructed by you, I accept it, it would be a great sin and worthy of an evil-doer, not in accordance with the way that leads to heaven and I should be adjudged the destroyer of the House of Ikshvaku. I abhor the wrong committed by my mother, and I offer salutations to Rama residing in the forest; I will follow him, he alone is king and worthy of ruling the three worlds! It were easy for him to administer this kingdom.\u201d", "All seated in the assembly, devoted to Rama, having listened to the righteous words of Bharata, shed tears of joy. Once again Shri Bharata spoke, saying: \u201cIf I fail to bring back Shri Rama then I will dwell there with him in the forest as Lakshmana has done. O You Wise Men, accompany me to the forest and with your good help, I will try every means to persuade him to return; skilled excavators, engineers and carpenters have been sent forward by me to render the road passable.\u201d", "The lover of his brother, Shri Bharata, turning to the royal counsellors, addressed the wise Sumantra seated near them and said: \u201cGo speedily and summon the army in my name to accompany me to the forest and bring the leaders here.\u201d", "Sumantra gladly carried out the commands of Prince Bharata. The military commanders were filled with joy at the order of Prince Bharata to proceed with the army to recall Shri Rama. In every home, wives joyfully urged their husbands to go with all speed and bring back Shri Rama.", "The leaders of the army riding their swift horses or in bullock carts and chariots gave the order to march. His preceptor the Guru Vasishtha being near, Shri Bharata said to Sumantra who was at his side, \u201cSpeedily prepare my chariot\u201d. Sumantra replied with reverence \u201cBe it so\u201d and highly pleased brought the chariot to which excellent horses were yoked. The Prince, filled with fortitude, illustrious, of fixed vows and a hero of the region of truth, resolving to recall Shri Rama from the forest, addressed Sumantra saying: \u201cO Sumantra, mobilise the army and order my friends and the chiefs of the people to be prepared. I desire to recall Rama for the good of the world.\u201d", "As instructed by the great prince, Sumantra speedily issued the command to the chiefs of the army and the friends of Bharata, fully explaining its purpose. In every dwelling the brahmins, the warriors, the merchants and the labourers brought together camels, chariots, mules, elephants and excellent horses.", "Early in the morning, the prince rose and mounting an excellent chariot, set out in haste, desirous of seeing Rama. Shri Bharata\u2019s chariot was preceded by ministers on horseback and priests in coaches and shone like the vehicle of the sun. Nine thousand richly bedecked elephants and sixty thousand carts with archers, together with a hundred thousand troops, accompanied the self-controlled prince, the devotee of truth. Kaikeyi, Sumitra and the renowned Kaushalya riding in resplendent chariots, went forward to bring Rama home. The multitude of the twice born proceeding from the capital, conversed solely of Shri Ramacandra and listened only to that which related to him. They said: \u201cWhen shall we behold Shri Rama, that cloud-complexioned, mighty armed one, of fixed purpose; the destroyer of the grief of the world? As the rising sun ends the darkness of the earth, so by the mere beholding of Shri Rama will our grief disappear.\u201d", "Conversing thus of Rama and embracing each other, the citizens went forward, filled with gladness.", "The foremost merchants of Ayodhya who had received permission from Bharata to accompany him, also those who had not been so favoured and others, went forward happily to meet Rama. Skilful engravers, potters, weavers and workers in gems, those who made fans of peacocks\u2019 feathers, woodcutters, plasterers, workers in glass and ivory, masons and perfumers, famous goldsmiths, makers of woollen cloth, washermen, masseurs, appliers of unguents, physicians and those who fumigated the dwellings with incense, also retailers of wine were present. Fullers, tailors, chiefs of villages, cowherds, dancing men and women, fishermen, and countless Vedic scholars of subdued mind, devoted to Rama, followed Prince Bharata in carts drawn by bullocks. All apparelled in pure raiment, their bodies anointed with red sandalwood, mounted on vehicles of various kinds, followed in the wake of Prince Bharata. The leaders of the army joyfully accompanied the prince, now going forth to bring Prince Rama home.", "Mounted in chariots, palanquins, bullock carts or on horses and elephants, the people proceeded a considerable distance and reached the banks of the Ganges at Shrangaverapur, where the friend of Shri Rama, Guha, dwelt with his people, guarding his country with vigilance. Arriving at the banks of Shri Ganga, the haunt of the cakravaka bird, those following the prince halted. The eloquent Bharata, seeing the beautiful Ganges, reviewed his troops and said to his ministers:\u2014", "\u201cLet the whole army camp here to-night, to-morrow we will cross the river. Now I desire to offer a libation to the spirit of my father, the king!\u201d", "His counsellors replied, \u201cBe it so, O Prince\u201d, and caused the people to halt there, each according to his rank. The saintly Bharata alone in his tent, on the banks of the Ganges reflected anxiously how he might best bring Shri Rama home.", "Observing the great army of Bharata encamped on the river bank, Guha was filled with apprehension, and said to his followers: \u201cMy Friends, this great army which is occupying the river banks, is not to be numbered even in imagination. Assuredly Prince Bharata has come here with evil intent, since the flag of his dynasty flies over his tent. Either he is come to bind and destroy me, or he is going to slay Rama who is exiled by his father, and helpless! Perchance the son of Kaikeyi desires to slay Rama in order to gain complete possession of the kingdom. But Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is my Lord, my Supporter and my Friend, I command you, therefore, to don your armour and take up arms, lining the banks of the Ganges for the protection of Rama. Let my servants and the troops living on fruit, roots and flesh guard the ferry boats of the Ganges. Let five hundred boats be manned with their crews, and let each be guarded by youthful watermen well armed and accoutred. See that they are vigilant. If Prince Bharata be well disposed towards Rama, his army may cross the Ganges to-day.\u201d", "Thus, mobilising his troops and servants, Guha the chief of ferrymen, taking gifts of fish, flesh and honey, went to meet Prince Bharata. Seeing Guha approaching, the excellent Sumantra said to Bharata: \u201cThis Guha attended by a thousand kinsmen is the king of this place, he is a native of these parts and is fully acquainted with the forest, he is a friend of your brother, Shri Rama. Therefore, O Prince, let him be admitted in audience to you, he assuredly knows the place where Rama and Lakshmana dwell.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the sagacious Sumantra, Bharata said: \u201cGo and tell Guha that I desire to meet him.\u201d", "The sanction of Prince Bharata being given, Guha with the chiefs of his people approached the prince and thus addressed him: \u201cO Lord, consider this country as thine own domain; not being acquainted with thine intention, I am unable to offer you a fitting welcome. This inconsiderable kingdom is thine and we also are thine! We entreat you to abide in your servant\u2019s house. I have brought roots, fruits and flesh both fresh and dried for you and other products of the forest for your use. It is my hope that thine army remain here to-night as my guests; may we have occasion to serve you, O Prince; to-morrow you canst go forward with thine army.\u201d", "The wise Bharata listened to the words of the chief of ferrymen and revealed his purpose to him, stating his reasons thus: \u201cO Friend of my elder brother, your hospitality is great, since you desirest to entertain so great an army as accompanies me.\u201d", "Prince Bharata then addressed Guha once more in gentle and well-chosen words, and said: \u201cO Chief of the Nishadas, by what way shall I proceed to the hermitage of the Sage Bharadvaja? The valley of the Ganges being flooded is difficult to cross.\u201d", "Guha, acquainted with all the paths and inaccessible parts of the forest, replied with great humility: \u201cO Illustrious Prince, have no anxiety! These, my kinsmen, armed with bows and arrows, fully acquainted with the forest, shall accompany you, and I also shall follow you in person. But observing your great army, I am filled with apprehension. Art you going to approach Rama, urged by some evil intent?\u201d", "Shri Bharata, whose heart was pure as the stainless heavens, answered him in sweet accents, saying: \u201cO Guha! May the time never come when I cause him distress. Do not look on me with fear O Friend; Rama, my elder brother, is to me equal to my father himself! O Guha, I go to bring back Shri Rama from the forest. Do not impute any evil motive to me! O Friend, this is the truth and the truth alone.\u201d", "Guha was filled with joy on hearing the words of Prince Bharata and again addressed him saying: \u201cO Bharata, blessed art you. In the whole world, I see none equal to you, since you desirest to relinquish a great empire that has fallen to you without any effort of thine own. Your fame in the world will live forever, since you, suffering distress, didst go forth to bring back Shri Rama.\u201d", "While Prince Bharata and Guha were thus conversing, the sun set and the night drew on. Gratified with the converse and hospitality of Guha, his army fully refreshed, Shri Bharata entered his tent to rest. But the prince, whose heart formerly had been unacquainted with grief and who was patient and free from sin, which is the chief cause of suffering, was yet overcome by pain on account of Rama. Sorrow for Raghava consumed him inwardly, as a fire consumes a withered and hollow tree in the forest. The perspiration caused by the fire of grief ran down his body, as the snow flows from the Himalayan peaks melting under the heat of the sun.", "By the mountain, the peak of which was sorrow, the recollection of Rama the rocks, his sighs the mineral charged streams, his desolation the forest, and weariness the promontories, his deep anxiety the wild beasts, his restlessness the herbs, by this mountain of affliction was Shri Bharata overwhelmed.", "Assailed by unspeakable anguish, the prince sighed heavily and almost bereft of reason, unconscious of his body, like a bull driven from the herd, was deprived of all rest.", "Guha approaching with his friends and kinsmen, embracing Shri Bharata, gently began to reassure him, regarding his elder brother.", "The dweller in that dense forest, Guha, began to console the virtuous and affectionate prince, whose love for the pious Lakshmana and Shri Ramacandra was unwavering, and said: \u201cO Lord, when the valiant Lakshmana, well armed, was keeping watch over the then sleeping Rama, I said to him, \u2018O Friend, a soft couch is prepared for you, sleep thereon at ease, O Prince of Raghu, those dwelling in the forest are accustomed to hardship but you are worthy of comfort, we will keep guard over Shri Rama this night. O Prince, there is none in the world so dear to us as Rama. Be not anxious, we will keep watch over Shri Rama; do you rest. By the grace of Rama, I hope to acquire great renown and the limitless wealth of dharma in this world. Therefore, O Prince, I will protect my friend, Shri Rama who is reposing with Sita! My kinsmen will keep watch; nothing in the forest is unknown to me, who constantly traverse it; I could challenge a great army with success, should it venture to attack Shri Rama!\u201d", "\u201cO Lord, the illustrious Lakshmana, established in virtue, answered me saying: \u2018O Guha, when the virtuous Rama and Sita are resting on the naked earth, how should I occupy an easy couch? How can any of the comforts of life or life itself be mine if Shri Rama does not also enjoy them? O Guha, behold Shri Rama, capable of subduing the gods and demons, resting on a bed of grass. Through great austerity and penance was Shri Dasaratha blessed with a son, like unto himself. Assuredly, the king will not long survive the exile of Shri Rama, and the land will soon become widowed. The women will lament loudly and then grow silent. I fear lest my Father, Queen Kaushalya and my mother Sumitra will not survive. Perchance my mother will continue to live in expectation of the return of Shatrughna, but Kaushalya, the mother of that great hero will surely die! The king desired to transfer the throne to Prince Bharata, but this ambition will not be realised by him. A great and honourable duty will be fulfilled in performing the funeral ceremonies for my sire. The capital of the king abounding with beautiful terraces and parks, pleasant highways and tall houses encrusted with gems, crowded with horses, elephants and chariots, resounding with music, furnished with pleasure grounds, where happy and healthy people gather, is blessed by those who walk therein. O Guha, shall we, returning with Rama, the fulfiller of firm vows, when the fourteen years of exile are over, joyfully enter Ayodhya in his company?\u201d", "Guha said: \u201cO Prince, thus keeping watch, the mighty Lakshmana, bearing his bow and arrows, passed the night. When the clear sun rose, the two princely brothers, on this selfsame bank of the sacred river caused their beautiful locks to be matted and were then conveyed by me, in safety, over the Ganges.", "The royal brothers, heroic, resplendent and the subduers of their enemies, their hair matted, attired in bark, armed with bow and quiver, departed with Sita, looking back at me, like mighty elephants.\u201d", "Having heard the moving tale related by Guha, Prince Bharata began to reflect on Rama. That tender prince of powerful arms, whose shoulders resembled a lion\u2019s and whose eyes were like the lotus, who was patient, youthful and charming in appearance yet sad at heart, at length sank to the ground unconscious, like an elephant stricken to the heart by a goad.", "Prince Shatrughna ever in attendance on Bharata, deeply afflicted by his state, embracing his body, wept aloud. Then all the mothers of Prince Bharata, emaciated with fasting and sorrow for their deceased lord, surrounded him, lying unconscious on the earth. The pious Queen Kaushalya approaching, raised Bharata up and pressed him to her breast. The ascetic queen, the lover of her son, straining him to her bosom as if he were her own child, weeping, enquired of him, saying: \u201cO My Son, art you afflicted by pain? The life of this royal family wholly depends on you! O Child, Shri Rama has gone to the forest with Lakshmana, I live only if I behold your face. King Dasaratha being dead, you alone art the protector of the people. O Child, hast you heard aught against Lakshmana or my only son, who, with his wife is gone to the forest?\u201d", "The renowned Bharata returning to his normal consciousness, consoled the weeping Kaushalya and then addressed Guha: \u201cO Guha, where did my brother pass the night here? What did he eat, on what couch did he rest? Where did Sita and Lakshmana dwell?\u201d", "Guha, the King of Nishadas, gladly related how he had entertained his gracious guest, Shri Rama. He said, \u201cO Bharata, rice, other foods and fruit in abundance were placed by me, before Shri Rama. To please me, that hero of the realm of truth, Shri Ramacandra, accepted the gifts, but recollecting his duty as a kshatriya did not partake of them. He said: \u201cO Friend, we are warriors and it is our duty to give all to others, not accepting any gift for ourselves.\u201d", "That night, the great-hearted Rama, having with Sita drunk the water brought by Shri Lakshmana, retired to rest, fasting. Shri Lakshmana finishing the water that was left over, all observed silence and performed the evening devotion with concentration. Thereafter the son of Sumitra brought kusha grass and spread it on the earth to serve as a couch for Rama. As Shri Rama and Sita rested there, Shri Lakshmana washed their feet in pure water and then moved to a distance to* mount guard over them.", "O Prince, here is that Ingudi tree, and here is the couch of grass on which Rama and Sita slept. That hero, Shri Lakshmana with his quiver filled with arrows, bound to his body, donning gloves made of goha-skin, drawing the string of his bow, paced round and round at a distance, guarding the royal pair.", "I also, O Prince, surrounded by my kinsmen, armed with an excellent bow, kept watch through the night, protecting Shri Ramacandra, who resembled Indra.", "Shri Bharata with his counsellors reverently approached the Ingudi tree and looked with love on the grassy couch. He said to his mothers: \u201cThis grass was pressed by the royal frame of the illustrious Ramacandra, who passed the first night of exile in this place. It ill became the great and wise son of King Dasaratha to sleep on the bare earth! How could Shri Rama, who ever reposed on a soft couch, sleep on the naked ground? Shri Rama who dwelt in a seven-storied palace, the floors of which were studded with gold and silver flowers, overlaid with soft carpets of many a hue on which marvellous floral designs were woven, the whole fragrant with the perfume of sandalwood and ambergris, and which resembled the clouds; where the cries of parrots and mainas were constantly heard and cool air flowed uninterruptedly through shafts; where the walls inlaid with gold and silver resembled the Meru mountain: in such a palace, Shri Rama was accustomed to rest, awakened each morning by the sweet music of the royal musicians and the gentle tinkling of women\u2019s anklets, and duly praised by the bards, panegyrists and ministers, in verse and song. To-day, he sleeps on the naked earth and hears the cry of jackals and other wild beasts. This matter is past belief, it resembles a dream! I consider nothing more powerful than the will of the Lord; how otherwise should the son of King Dasaratha be seen sleeping on the earth? How could the daughter of King Janaka, that beautiful princess, the beloved daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha, sleep on the naked ground?", "\u201cO Mother, here is my brother\u2019s couch, on it he tossed, crushing the grass by the weight of his limbs. It would seem that Shri Sita rested here also, wearing her ornaments, since I perceive particles of gold lying here and there. O Mother, see Sita\u2019s scarf became entangled here, for in this place I see threads of silk! Whether it be hard or soft, the couch of her lord is sweet to a woman I See! The young and tender Sita, devoted to her husband, experienced no smart, resting here. Oh! I am undone! What a merciless wretch am I! On my account, Shri Ramacandra and his spouse lay on this hard couch! Alas that Shri Rama, deprived of kingly felicity, though born of a royal line, dear to all and the cause of universal joy, whose complexion resembles the blue lotus, whose eyes are slightly red, charming to look upon, not meriting tribulation, should have to sleep on the naked earth.", "\u201cBlessed and fortunate is Lakshmana, who followed his brother in the days of adversity 1 Fruitful is the life of Princess Sita who, thus accompanied her lord to the forest. Wretched are we, bereft of Shri Rama; nor are we certain that he will allow us to serve him. King Dasaratha, being dead, and Shri Rama having entered the forest, the earth appears to me like a boat without a pilot. None desires to usurp the place spiritually reserved for him, who dwells in the forest. To-day the capital is empty and unprotected, horses and elephants wander here and there unconfined, there being none to control them; the gates of the city are left open and unguarded; the army is melancholy and indifferent to the defence of the capital! Ayodhya externally without protection and bereft of purpose, is in a sorry state. Even its enemies turn from it, as men turn away from poisoned food!", "\u201cFrom to-day, assuming an ascetic garb, I will sleep on the earth and live on fruit and roots. I shall live in the forest for the remainder of the term which Rama has to discharge, so that his vow may be fulfilled. My brother Shatrughna shall dwell with me in the forest, while Lakshmana returns with Rama to protect the capital! The learned brahmins will install Shri Rama in Ayodhya! I entreat the gods to fulfil the desire of my heart. If Rama, however, will not grant my request, I will remain in the forest as his servant, but how should he reject my appeal? Is he not compassionate towards his devotees?\u201d", "Bharata having slept on the same spot where Shri Rama had lately rested, and the night being over, called Shatrughna, and said to him: \u201cArise, O Brother, may good attend you! The day has dawned, sleep no more! Please summon Guha, the chief of the Nishadas, so that he may convey our army across the river.\u201d", "Shatrughna answered: \u201cO Noble One, I am awake. I was not able to sleep, for like you I have been meditating on Shri Rama!\u201d", "As these two, the chiefs of men, stood conversing together, Guha approaching, said with humility: \u201cO Prince, didst you rest at ease, on the river bank? Did any disturbance visit you or thine army?\u201d", "Hearing these words of Guha uttered with affection, Shri Bharata answered him, saying: \u201cO King, we have passed this night in peace, having been highly honoured by you. Now let your servants convey our army over the river.\u201d", "Guha hastily returned to his city and spake thus to his servants and relatives: \u201cBrothers, arise, awake, may you ever be fortunate! Bring boats to the bank and convey the army over the river!\u201d", "Thus addressed, the ferrymen arose and gathering five hundred boats together, brought them to the bank. A special barge that was seaworthy, named \u201cSvastika\u201d, hung with large bells and flying banners with apertures for air, was also furnished, whereon white woollen rugs were spread like carpets, small bells tinkling melodiously when it sailed. This barque was steered by Guha himself. On it stepped the illustrious Princes Bharata and Shatrughna with the Queens Kaushalya and Sumitra, and other ladies of high degree, preceded by their spiritual preceptors, the priests and learned brahmins; finally, the baggage was loaded.", "At the time of departure, the noise of those burning the residue left by the army, of those who plunged into the holy Ganges and the porters bearing the baggage, ascended to the sky. The boats, crowded with attendants, guarded by picked ferrymen, sailing swiftly, conveyed them over the river. Many vessels contained women only, while others were filled with horses or bullocks, carts, cattle and mules.", "Reaching the other bank of the river, the people disembarked, the ferrymen and Guha\u2019s relatives playing diverse games in the water as they returned. Some of the elephants, resembling mountains as they moved, were driven across by their mahouts, others crossed in boats, some on rafts and some swam. Guha\u2019s servants ferried the army over the river, before taking their morning bath. During the period of Maitra, following on the sunrise, the army crossed the sacred stream and entered the charming forest.", "Arriving at holy Prayaga, the magnanimous Bharata spoke encouraging words to the army and ordered them to camp at ease. Then the prince accompanied by the Guru Vasishtha and other priests, went to see the Sage Bharadvaja.", "Approaching the hermitage of that learned and illumined sage, the son of Brihaspati, they beheld in the dense and delightful forest, charming huts thatched with leaves.", "[Full title: Prince Bharata with Shri Vasishtha visit the Sage Bharadvaja\u2019s hermitage].", "Bharata, beholding the hermitage of the Sage Bharadvaja, leaving his army a league behind and laying aside his weapons and royal apparel, attired in a simple silken garment, proceeded on foot, preceded by his preceptor. Perceiving the sage himself, he left his counsellors and followed Shri Vasishtha only. The great ascetic Bharadvaja, beholding Prince Bharata approaching, rising from his seat, commanded his disciples to bring the arghya. The muni advancing to greet Shri Vasishtha, Prince Bharata offered salutations to him, the sage recognizing him as the son of King Dasaratha. The Sage Bharadvaja then calling for the ritual appointments presented them with the arghya, and refreshed them with fruits; he then enquired respecting their welfare and if all were well in Ayodhya. Then he asked concerning the state treasury and the ministers, but, knowing the king to be dead, he made no enquiry concerning him.", "In return, Shri Vasishtha and Bharata enquired as to the health of the sage, the state of his body, the sacred fire, his disciples, the deer and the birds. The great ascetic Bharadvaja informed them respecting all these things and then, prompted by the affection he bore for Shri Rama, said to Bharata: \u201cO Prince, what occasion has brought you hither, who art now the ruler of the kingdom? Tell me all. King Dasaratha, urged by his consort, banished Prince Rama to the forest, for the period of fourteen years. I trust that you, desirous of enjoying the kingdom without reserve, art not the harbourer of ill-will to your brother?\u201d", "Bitterly wounded by the rishi\u2019s words, Prince Bharata, his eyes suffused with tears, his throat choked with emotion, said: \u201cO Lord, you are all-knowing, if you dost thus regard me, then my life is vain. I am in no way implicated in the fate of Shri Rama. Such villainy would never proceed from me. O My Lord, why dost you charge me thus? That which my mother has done, on my account, is not approved by me, nor should I ever condone it. I go to gratify that great prince, by offering salutations to him and with the intention of bringing him back to the capital. O Divine One, this is my purpose, be pleased to tell me where Rama, now the lord of the earth, is to be found?\u201d", "Requested likewise by Shri Vasishtha and the other priests, Shri Bharadvaja, captivated by the words of Bharata, answered: \u201cO Great One, you are born in the illustrious family of Raghu, and it is therefore not a source of wonder that dutiful regard for your preceptor, self-control and the following of the path of the wise, are all united in you! By my yogic powers, the contents of your heart were known to me, but I questioned you, that your resolution might be established, and your fame proclaimed throughout the whole world. It is known to me where Shri Rama and Lakshmana conversant with righteousness, abide. They dwell on the great mountain Cittrakuta; do you go thither to-morrow. To-day, stay here with your counsellors.", "O Wise One, do you accede to my request.\u201d", "Then Bharata, the prince of great renown, accepted the offer of the sage and remained all that night at his hermitage.", "Prince Bharata, having decided to remain in the hermitage, the sage invited him to a repast. Shri Bharata said: \u201cO Holy Lord, you have already entertained me with water, fruit and berries, I am wholly satisfied.\u201d", "Shri Bharadvaja smilingly answered: \u201cI know you to be pleased with whatever is lovingly offered to you, but, O Prince, I desire to entertain your whole army, it is meet that you accede to my request. O Great Prince, why art you come, leaving thine army at a distance? Why didst you come unattended by thine army?\u201d", "Hearing these words, Prince Bharata answered with humility: \u201cO Lord, I did not come attended by mine army, in deference to you. It becomes a king or a king\u2019s son to protect the hermitages of his kingdom! O Lord! I am accompanied by many horses and wild elephants occupying a vast area. Fearing lest they should destroy the trees, the thatched huts and defile the water of the ponds and wells, I came alone, leaving them behind.\u201d", "Then the Maharishi Bharadvaja said: \u201cBring thine army hither.\u201d", "Thus commanded, the prince brought his army thither. Entering the sacrificial pavilion, the rishi drank three times of the water there, and reciting a certain formula, sprinkled some on his body. Then invoking Vishvakarma to provide the entertainment, and speaking slowly, he said: \u201cI summon the celestial beings, Vishvakarma and Twashta, let them prepare dwellings for the army. I desire to offer Prince Bharata hospitality, I therefore call upon the deities Yama, Varuna, Kuvera and also Indra. Let them assist me in providing the entertainment. I also summon all the rivers, flowing above or below from east to west and from west to east. Let some of these produce the delicious wine named Maireya and that named Saura, and also cool, sweet water, like the juice of the sugar cane. I summon further the heavenly musicians called Haha and Huhu, together with other divine beings and nymphs. I summon the dancing apsaras, Ghritaci, Vishvaci, Mishrakeshi, Alambusha, Nagadanta, Hema and Soma, who dwell in the Himalayas. I call on the dancing nymphs attendant on Brahma and Indra; let them attire themselves in beautiful apparel, bringing their instruments. I desire the celestial forest Caitraratha to appear here, the leaves of whose trees are formed like beautiful damsels. I desire further foods of many kinds that can be chewed, sucked or licked, and various drinks to be prepared by the deity presiding over the moon. Let garlands of fresh flowers be made ready and beautiful goblets and different dishes of flesh be produced here instantaneously!\u201d", "By his yogic power and the proper recitation of the sacred mantras, the holy Sage Bharadvaja produced all that was necessary. Facing the east in the posture of invitation, Shri Bharadvaja sat in meditation for a space. Then, one by one, the gods appeared before him. The cool, slow and fragrant breezes blowing from the Malaya and Dadura mountains, tempered the heat. The clouds rained down flowers and the sound of the divine dundubhis (drums) was heard; delightful zephyrs began to blow, nymphs danced, the celestial musicians sang and the notes of the vina were heard everywhere. The earth and the sky were filled with sweet and harmonious sounds, heard by all living beings. As the divine music continued, Bharata\u2019s army beheld the wonderful structure wrought by Vishvakarma. They perceived the whole area within a radius of four miles, to be covered with a carpet of green and glistening grass sparkling like a green emerald. Its beauty was enhanced by silva, kapitha, amlaki and mango trees. A wood appeared wherein people could wander, also a divine stream flowing between banks adorned by various trees. Beautiful white mansions were erected, with stables for elephants and horses. Palaces with their balconies decorated with leaves and flowers were to be seen, and others adorned with green and flowery sprays and garlands of pure white blossoms sprinkled with scented water. These dwellings contained square courts serving as reception halls with space for palanquins, and coaches. Food of all kinds, rice, the juice of sugar cane and every variety of confection was to be found there, with curry puffs, pancakes and other delicious dishes served in clean vessels, while excellent carpets and seats were spread for relaxation, and couches with spotless coverings and quilts.", "Entering these mansions with the permission of the Sage Bharadvaja, Prince Bharata was followed by his servants, ministers and priests who, perceiving all to be well furnished, were highly gratified.", "In one of the mansions, a room was set apart containing a throne where retainers holding the canopy and camara were in attendance. Bharata with his ministers, circumambulated the royal dais as if it were occupied by Shri Rama and bowing to it respectfully, Shri Bharata, holding the camara, occupied a lower seat, the counsellors, priests and army commanders assuming positions in accordance with their respective rank.", "Now, at the command of the holy sage, streams of milk, thickened with rice, flowed before Bharata\u2019s eyes. Beautiful houses, washed with quicklime, appeared on the river banks. Twenty thousand youthful women, enchantingly attired and wearing beautiful ornaments came there at the instance of Brahma. Kuvera also sent twenty thousand lovely damsels adorned with gold, gems and pearls. Further twenty thousand nymphs from the region of Indra appeared, whose beauty caused men to lose their reason. Narada, Gopha and other brilliant musicians began to sing and play before Bharata, and the celestial nymphs to dance in the presence of the prince, at the rishi\u2019s command. All the flowers most highly esteemed in the celestial gardens among the gods, were seen at Prayaga, through the power of Bharadvaja. The trees applauded, the bahadur tree performed on the cymbals and the pipal danced, through the influence of the sage, and those named devaparna, tala and kuraka assumed the form of dwarfs! Plants by the name of shingsapa [shimshapa?], amalaki and jambu, and twining creepers such as the jasmine and mallika, taking on the shape of women in the hermitage of Bharadvaja, cried out: \u201cO Wine-Bibbers, drink! O Hungry Ones, eat kheeva! Come, fill yourselves with the various kinds of meat!\u201d", "Each person was bathed in the cool river and attended by seven or eight beautiful maidens with lustrous eyes, who massaged their body with oil and unguents. Their bath completed, many women dried them with soft cloths and gave them sweetened water, tasting like ambrosia, to drink.", "The keepers attended carefully to the horses, elephants, mules, camels and bullocks. Those steeds belonging to the royal stables and ridden by great generals, were fed by the grooms on bundles of sugar cane and parched and sweetened rice, their attendants and mahouts could hardly recognize their charges. The soldiery were now intoxicated with wine and indulging in every pleasure! Each was gratified in whatever he desired; their bodies anointed with sandalwood paste and united with the nymphs in amorous dalliance, they exclaimed: \u201cWe will neither go to Ayodhya nor enter the Dandaka forest! Let Bharata live at ease and Shri Rama dwell in the forest!\u201d", "Thus did the warriors and grooms express themselves in the state of inebriation, while thousands of soldiers, in exultation, shouted aloud: \u201cVerily, this is heaven!\u201d Running hither and thither with garlands round their necks, innumerable soldiers danced, sang and laughed. Though they had partaken to the full of excellent dishes, sweet as nectar, yet when they perceived fresh articles of food, they could not restrain themselves from eating anew!", "Thousands of messengers, servants and the wives of the soldiery, putting on colourfill raiment, displayed themselves with pride. Elephants, horses, camels, deer and birds were fully satisfied; none wanted for anything! No one, in the army of Bharata, was seen in soiled garments or hungry or unkempt, none was seen with an unclean countenance or uncombed hair!", "The men beheld countless dishes of mutton, pork, venison and other meats cooked in fruit-juices and fried in butter with cloves, caraway seeds and lentils simmering gently in them. Thousands of vessels were filled with spiced rice, garnished with flowers and flags. All were speechless with wonder on beholding them! Within a radius of five miles, the wells were filled with frumenty (khiva) and cows like Kamadhenu fulfilled every desire! The trees dripped honey and the lakes were filled with the sparkling wine Maireya, and banked with dressed viands such as deer, chickens and peacocks. Hundreds and thousands of dishes were provided, and myriads of vessels filled with curds, mixed with caraway seeds, ginger and other fragrant spices, were served there. Lakes of yoghurt and milk, together with heaps of sugar, were to be seen on the river banks, as also fragrant crushed leaves and unguents with large pots of sandalwood paste, mirrors and towels! An abundance of sandals and shoes were provided, whilst antimony, combs, brushes, parasols, bows and quivers, armour and ornamental seats were placed here and there! Tanks, full of liquid mixed with herbs to promote digestion, were taken to the banks of lakes where descent was easy, and where the people could bathe freely and drink when they pleased! These lakes were filled with pure water, abounding in lotuses and fringed with tender grass of blue and emerald hue; here, resting places for the beasts were also to be found.", "Prince Bharata\u2019s companions were astounded at the entertainment provided by the Maharishi Bharadvaja. All passed the night in amusement, as in the garden of Indra!", "At dawn, the rivers, celestial musicians and nymphs took leave of the maharishi and returned to their own abode. But Prince Bharata\u2019s followers were still flushed and inebriated, their bodies painted with sandalwood, the flower garlands in heaps like mountains, lying everywhere, scattered and trampled on by men and beasts.", "Prince Bharata, having passed the night in enjoyment of the entertainment provided, early in the morning, desirous of seeing Rama, approached the muni.", "With joined palms, he stood before the holy rishi who was engaged in the fire ritual.", "The Sage Bharadvaja enquired of him, saying: \u201cO Sinless Prince, didst you pass the night in my hermitage in peace? Are all satisfied with the meagre entertainment provided by me?\u201d", "Shri Bharata, offering salutations to the maharishi, who had come out from his hermitage replied: \u201cO Blessed Lord, I and my whole army have been rendered completely happy in your hermitage, you have fully satisfied us all. My people have passed the night agreeably, they have slept in excellent houses and partaken of delicious dishes, and have lost all sense of the fatigue caused by the journey. O Great Sage, now allow me to take leave of you and go to my brother; look on me with favour, I beg of you, O Wise One, how far from here is the hermitage of the pious Rama and which is the way thither?\u201d", "The sage, eminent in ascetic practices, replied to Bharata, who desired to see his brother: \u201cO Prince, at ten miles distance from here, in a field full of boulders, is the beautiful mountain named Cittrakuta! To the north of that mountain flows the river Mandakini, winding through flowery forests, its banks planted with blossoming trees. O Friend, close to that river, on the Cittrakuta mountain, you shalt find your two brothers dwelling in a thatched hut. O Fortunate Prince, on the southern bank of the Yamuna, you will see two paths, do you take the right path with thine army, horses and elephants! This path will take you to Shri Rama.\u201d", "At the moment of departure the consorts of King Dasaratha, descending from their chariots, came to the place where the great sage was and stood encircling him. Among them the frail and trembling Kaushalya and Sumitra touched the feet of the holy man. Then Kaikeyi, thwarted in her designs and despised by the whole world, touched the feet of the sage and circumambulated him. Grief-stricken, she stood at a little distance from Bharata, as the holy Bharadvaja addressed the prince, saying: \u201cO Prince, I desire to be acquainted with your mothers.\u201d", "The ever eloquent Bharata answered humbly: \u201cO Holy Lord, here is my father\u2019s chief queen, wretched and weakened through fasting, yet resembling a goddess. She is the mother of that Lion among men, the highly intrepid Prince Rama I Comparable to Aditi who brought forth Prajapati, she has given birth to Raghava! She, who leaning on her arm, stands with a sorrowful heart, like the branch of the karnikara tree stripped of its flowers, is the Queen Sumitra, the mother of those heroes of truth, Shri Lakshmana and Shatrughna. O Great Sage, she who has brought great affliction on these two chiefs of men and caused the death of King Dasaratha by separating him from his sons, who is given to anger and who is vain and shallow, esteeming herself favoured, who is highly ambitious and fickle and yet looks upon herself as free from imperfection, that cruel and wicked Kaikeyi, is my mother I O Great Muni, it is she who has caused my great misfortune!\u201d", "Unable to utter further, his throat choked with emotion, the prince began to sigh heavily, his eyes inflamed, breathing like a provoked serpent. Then the holy sage, acquainted with what should come to pass, answered saying: \u201cMy Son, do not reproach Queen Kaikeyi, the exile of Shri Rama will be productive of great good and the gods and danavas and the illustrious sages will gain great benefit from the presence of Shri Rama in the forest 1\u201d", "Hearing this, Bharata bowed low to the rishi and receiving his blessing, circumambulated him with reverence. Then craving permission from the sage to depart, he ordered his army to prepare to march.", "The leaders of the forces mounted their horses, while others, ascending golden chariots, started on their journey. Elephants with howdahs fixed by golden chains and adorned with fluttering flags went forward, the bells hanging from the male and female tuskers causing a sound like the thunder of the clouds at the end of the rainy season! The other vehicles large and small, conveying members of the royal family advanced also.", "Shri Bharata, intent on seeing Rama, riding in a resplendent palanquin shining like the sun or moon, with his great army, moved towards the south, covering the earth like a vast cloud.", "The horses and elephants were all contented and the vast concourse inspiring the wild deer and birds with terror, looked splendid as it entered the deep forest.", "[Full title: They behold the hermitage of Shri Rama].", "As the mighty army traversed the forest, the leaders of the herds of wild elephants with their companions, ran away in alarm. Bears, leopards and other fierce beasts could be seen fleeing on the hilltops and by the banks of the river.", "Supremely gratified, Prince Bharata proceeded in the midst of his soldiers who shouted as they marched. The army of the illustrious Bharata, resembled an ocean, whose waves spread over the earth or like the clouds covering the sky during the rainy season. The ground for miles was covered with elephants and horses, so that no trace of it could be seen.", "Having marched a considerable distance, Shri Bharata, perceiving his animals to be fatigued, addressed the holy priest, Shri Vasishtha, saying: \u201cThis country appears to be as beautiful as described to me, I deem that we have reached that place spoken of by the Sage Bharadvaja. This mountain is Cittrakuta, and this is the Mandakini river, and this is the forest which, from a distance, resembled a blue cloud. These are the glorious peaks of Cittrakuta, which are being trodden by my great elephants! See, O Holy Guru, as the dark douds pour down water in the rainy season, so do the elephants, whose trunks are scarred by the waving branches of the trees, scatter flowers on the hills.", "\u201cO Shatrughna, behold the lovely Cittrakuta mountain sought after by the gods; everywhere herds of deer wander about enhancing its beauty, like crocodiles swimming gracefully in the sea. As clouds driven by the wind in winter adorn the sky, so do these deer running before the army, render the forest delightful.", "\u201cOur soldiers decorating their heads with flowers, resemble the people of the south who crown themselves with blossoms. See, O Shatrughna, the forest that appeared terrifying and seemed to breathe by being filled with men, resembles Ayodhya itself!", "\u201cThe dust rising from the hoofs of the bullocks covers the sky and settles there, till the wind quickly dispels it, as if those things obstructing my vision of Shri Rama were being removed from my eyes. O Shatrughna, behold these horses yoked to the chariots with their charioteers, swiftly passing through the forest! And see those beautiful peacocks with long feathers, running in fear towards their habitation on the mountain. O Sinless Brother, this place appears enchanting to me and a fit abode for ascetics.", "\u201cHow lovely are the spotted deer wandering about with their hinds; they appear as if studded with flowers. Let my leaders go forward and seek out the place where Shri Rama and Lakshmana dwell.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Shri Bharata, the warriors bearing weapons in their hands, entered the forest and there perceived a spot where smoke was ascending. On beholding this, they returned to Prince Bharata and communicated to him their belief, that the two royal brothers dwelt where the smoke arose. They said: \u201cIf it be not Shri Rama and Lakshmana yonder, then surely it is some devotee who can inform us concerning the dwelling place of Raghava!\u201d", "Hearing this pleasing report, Shri Bharata addressed the leaders of the army saying: \u201cDo you remain here, do not proceed further, I, with the holy Guru Vasishtha and Sumantra will go forward to that place.\u201d", "Thus commanded die warriors halted and Shri Bharata looked towards the spot where the smoke was visible. Observing the smoke, the warriors, waiting at that place, rejoiced, believing the time for the meeting with Shri Rama was at hand.", "Shri Rama who had passed many days on that mountain, gratified Shri Sita by showing her many scenes of natural beauty, they themselves appearing as lovely as Indra and his consort.", "Shri Rama said: \u201cO Fortunate One, beholding the beauty of this pleasant mountain, no longer does the separation from my friends or my country cause me pain! O Centre of Delight! behold the loveliness of these peaks abounding in metals of various kinds, reaching the skies and frequented by birds of every species! These peaks, some of which shine like silver, some of which are ruddy, some yellow, some glittering with the splendour of the brilliant gems concealed in them; some sparkling with sapphire and crystal, and some resembling quicksilver and glittering like the stars! Though many lions and leopards abound in the forest, yet influenced by the pure nature of the ascetics dwelling here, they have ceased to follow their cruel instincts. Many varieties of birds have their nests on yonder hill, trees laden with fruit and flowers affording delightful shade, render the mountain enchanting!", "\u201cHere are mango, jambu, asana, lohdra, piyala, panasa, dhuva, ankotha, bhavya, tinisha, bilva, tindura, bamboo, kasanari, arista, varana, madhuca, tilaka, vadari, amlaka, nipa, vetra, dhanvaria, vijaka and other trees.", "\u201cO Auspicious Princess, behold the ravishing loveliness of these hills where the wise kinneras wander in pairs, their swords and coloured apparel hanging on the branches.

These mountains with their cascades and bubbling springs appear like mighty elephants the ichor flowing from their foreheads.", "\u201cWhat mind would not be filled with delight by the breezes issuing from the caves of the mountain, redolent with fragrance, pleasing to the senses? O Peerless One, if it be for me to dwell here with you and Lakshmana for innumerable years, no grief or anxiety will visit me. O Lovely Lady, on the mountain of Cittrakuta, rendered pleasant by a profusion of flowers and fruits, whose delightful peaks echo with the sweet song of birds, I am content to dwell! By residing here, two objects have been achieved, the fulfilment of my father\u2019s vow and the satisfaction of Prince Bharata. O Daughter of King Videha, behold this enchanting spot where self-control and asceticism are easily exercised. Say, art you happy here? The discipline of residence in the forest is declared by royal sages to be a means to liberation. Our ancestors such as Manu have held that residence in the forest is the means of acquiring the form of the gods. Behold, O Princess, yonder mountain, adorned by thousands of rocks blue, yellow, purple and white. At night, the healing herbs shine like fire, lighting the crags with their radiance. See, O Princess, some of the caves resemble houses, some appear like flower gardens, all enhancing the glory of the mountain. It would seem that Cittrakuta has sprung forth from the earth and from every side appears incomparably beautiful. Observe, O Auspicious One, how those devoted to pleasure, have spread couches here and there, and covered them with azure lotuses overlaid with coverings of bark. See the faded garlands cast aside by them and the rinds of many fruits of which they have partaken.", "\u201cThis mountain Cittrakuta, in variety of flowers and transparent waters, has surpassed the capital of Indra in loveliness. O Sita, I will pass the twelve years here with Prince Lakshmana and you; pursuing the highest virtue and discipline, I shall thus protect my kingdom and earn merit.\u201d", "Having pointed out the beauty of the hills to Sita, Raghava now showed her the pleasant river Mandakini issuing from the mountain. The lotus-eyed Lord addressed the daughter of King Janaka, whose countenance resembled the moon, saying: \u201cO Princess, behold the river Mandakini with its delightful banks frequented by swans, cranes and other waterfowl, abounding in flowering trees of different kinds, which cause it to resemble the river Sangandhika in the region of Kuvera. Its pleasant fords, where I desire to bathe, the waters of which have been rendered muddy by the herds of deer who have come to drink and recently departed, all these attract the heart. O Dear One, the ascetics attired in robes of bark and deerskin, bathe at stated seasons in this river. O Princess of beautiful eyes, here the munis observing strict and austere vows, stand with uplifted arms, worshipping the sun. The trees agitated by the breeze, cause the hills to appear as if they were dancing. The blossoms scattered by the force of the wind make it seem as if Cittrakuta were offering flowers to the river. O Auspicious One, here the waters of Mandakini sparkle like gems and there they form a sandy beach. Groups of perfect beings frequent the banks. O Princess, behold the heaps of flowers shaken down from the branches by the wind, and others floating through the air and falling into the river to be carried away by the water. O Kalyani, behold the wild geese standing in the shallows, uttering sweet cries to summon their mates or diverting themselves with them. O Lovely Sita, when I behold the Cittrakuta mountain and the river Mandakini in company with you, I esteem it a greater joy than any Ayodhya could yield me. Come, O Sita, and let us two bathe in the river Mandakini, frequented by perfect beings who are endowed with inner and outer control and are devoted to the practice of austerity. O Princess, you didst formerly play with your maids of honour in Ayodhya, to-day amuse thyself with me in the Mandakini river, pelting me with red and white lotuses and splashing the waters over me. O Dear One, imagine those dwelling here to be the citizens of Ayodhya and the Mandakini to be the river Sarayu. O Sita, I am happy with you, who art obedient to my command as is also Prince Lakshmana. O Beloved, bathing thrice a day with you in the river and living on honey, fruits and berries, I feel no desire for the comforts of the kingdom of Ayodhya. Who will not be happy, dwelling on the banks of the river Mandakini, where herds of elephants wander and lions and monkeys come to quench their thirst/ and where flowers grow throughout the year?\u201d", "Thus Shri Rama conversed on many wondrous things concerning the Mandakini river with Sita and taking the hand of the princess, wandered with her over the blue and beautiful Cittrakuta mountain.", "[Full title: Shri Rama and Sita see the army approaching and Lakshmana vows to destroy it].", "Having shown Sita the beauties of the river Mandakini, Rama and Sita seated themselves on a rock. Feasting Videhi with venison, Shri Rama, in order to please her, spoke in this wise: \u201cThis meat is pure and is rendered delicious by being roasted in the fire.\u201d", "While thus conversing with Sita, he observed the dust rising like a cloud, stirred up by the feet of the approaching army of Bharata and heard the tramp of marching warriors at the sound of which the leaders of the elephants with their herds, ran hither and thither in agitation. Seeing the herds of elephants fleeing at the tumult caused by the army, Shri Rama said to Lakshmana: \u201cO Lakshmana, Queen Sumitra is fortunate indeed to be your mother. Is this warlike clamour issuing from the clouds? The herds of elephants dwelling in the dense forest, the wild buffaloes and the deer are fleeing away in terror I Has any king or prince come to hunt in the woods, or has some terrible and bloodthirsty beast entered the forest? Enquire into the matter, O Lakshmana! Even the birds are not carefree in their flight; it becomes you to seek out the cause of this commotion.\u201d", "Speedily climbing a shala tree, Shri Lakshmana looked in all directions. First he examined the eastern quarter, then he looked towards the north and there he beheld a vast army composed of elephants, horses, chariots and well-armed infantry!", "Describing the approaching army with its elephants, horses, chariots and flags, Shri Lakshmana said to Rama: \u201cO Great One, put out the fire and let Sita enter the cave, do you arm thyself and take up your bow and arrow.\u201d", "Shri Rama answered Lakshmana saying: \u201cO Child, ascertain by the symbols on the flags to whom this army belongs.\u201d", "The prince listened to Rama\u2019s words and burning with anger desirous of consuming the army, replied: \u201cWithout doubt, Bharata, having secured the throne has come to slay us both in order to enjoy rulership, unopposed! See, by that large and beautiful tree is a chariot with a white flag bearing the sign of a pomegranate tree. The soldiers mounted on swift moving horses are coming towards me. I see the riders on elephants also. O Hero, let us both, armed with bows and arrows, climb the hill, or clad in battle array, stand here fully prepared. We shall surely defeat Bharata. To-day, we shall subdue him on whose account all our sufferings have come to pass. O Rama, that Bharata, on whose account, you, Sita and I, have been deprived of our kingdom and cast into tribulation, is approaching like an enemy. He must certainly be slain, O Prince, I see no sin in destroying him. It were no sin to slay one who seeks to injure you. O Prince, he has already wronged you; by slaying Bharata, you canst acquire mastery over the whole earth. To-day, Kaikeyi, avid for the kingdom, will see her son slain in the field. Seeing Bharata slain by me, like a tree uprooted by an elephant, Kaikeyi will suffer great anguish! I shall slay Kaikeyi also, and her friends and Manthara too. O Bestower of Honour, I will free the world of the sinful Kaikeyi; to-day I will let loose my long restrained wrath on the forces of mine enemy, as a fire consumes dried grass. To-day, I will drench the fields of Cittrakuta with the blood of mine enemies. To-day, those elephants, wounded by my sharp arrows and those men slain by me, will be dragged hither and thither by wild beasts. To-day, I will redeem my vow, by destroying Bharata and his army with my bow and arrow.\u201d", "Seeing Lakshmana overcome with anger and desire for vengeance, Shri Rama sought to pacify him saying: \u201cO Lakshmana, the learned warrior Bharata, fully armed, is coming to see us in person, of what value is shield or sword? What should I do with a kingdom obtained by slaying my brother Bharata, I having undertaken to fulfil my father\u2019s behests? I will never accept riches obtained by the slaying of relatives and friends which would be as acceptable to me as food mixed with poison 1 O Lakshmana, I promise you, it is for the sake of my brothers that I desire to pursue virtue, legitimately acquired wealth, pleasures, and even the kingdom. O Lakshmana, I speak the truth, by this sign, touching my arms, \u2018I desire a kingdom only for the sake of supporting my brothers and securing their good\u2019. O Charming Prince! The acquisition of the kingdom is not difficult to me, but O, My Brother, I do not even desire dominion of the celestial region if it can only be acquired by unrighteous means! O Dear One! May the Deity of Fire consume all that gives me joy, if it is not for your good and to the advantage of Bharata and Shatrughna! It seems to me that when my dearest brother, ever devoted to me, returned to Ayodhya from the home of his maternal uncle, after hearing that we three, robed in bark had entered the forest, he, overwhelmed by affection and grief, set out hither to seek us I I see no other purpose for his advent here. Or it may be that Bharata, wroth with his mother has reproached her with bitter words and has come here to be reconciled with me. It is meet that Bharata should see me and I cannot believe that he comes as an enemy. What harm has Bharata ever done to us, O Brother, that to-day, you assumest him to be against us? It is improper for you to speak ill or harshly of Bharata. Those bitter things you sayest of Bharata, you have in fact said of me. O Son of Sumitra, how should a father slay his son, or a brother slay his brother, whatever betide? If you have said all this on account of the kingdom, then I will desire Bharata to give you the kingdom. O Lakshmana, if I say to Bharata \u2018Give the crown to Lakshmana\u2019, assuredly he will answer \u2018Be it so\u2019.\u201d", "Shri Lakshmana was profoundly humiliated by the words of Rama, his limbs and muscles contracted and he was sunk in shame. He said: \u201cIt appears that the Maharaja Dasaratha himself has come hither to see us.\u201d", "Seeing Lakshmana abashed, Shri Rama answered: \u201cI also believe my father is come to see us, and will seek to take us home to the capital, knowing how grievously we suffer in the forest!\u201d", "\u201cIt may be, too, that the king, knowing Sita to be worthy of every happiness, will take her home. See, O Brother, two excellent horses of noble breed, swift as the wind, appear in view! The great and aged elephant Shatrunjaya that carries my illustrious father, marches before the army, but I feel apprehensive for I do not behold the white umbrella of my renowned Lord! O Lakshmana, descend from the tree.\u201d", "The prince having descended in obedience to Shri Rama, stood before him with joined palms.", "Shri Bharata meanwhile commanded his army not to approach or disturb the hermitage of Rama. The army with its elephants and horses occupied an area of seven miles and the prudent Bharata who, to please Rama, had rid himself of all egoity and employed only virtuous means, caused it to take up its position at some distance from the Cittrakuta mountain.", "That exalted one, Shri Bharata, truly obedient to the behests of his Guru, perceiving his army well lodged, proceeded on foot to meet Shri Rama. As soon as the army was encamped, he addressed Shatrughna in these words: \u201cO Excellent One, you with your men and a few huntsmen, speedily search the forest and seek out Shri Rama\u2019s hermitage. Let Guha attended by a thousand of his warriors, armed with bows, arrows and swords, search for Shri Rama in the forest. I, myself, in the company of the counsellors, citizens, elders and brahmins, will go on foot through the forest. I shall not rest till I have beheld the saintly Rama, the valiant Lakshmana and the most auspicious Sita. I shall not seek repose till I have looked on the shining countenance of Shri Rama, my elder brother. My mind will taste no peace till I have placed my forehead at the feet of Rama, that bear the marks of royalty. My soul will find no delight till I have placed Shri Rama on the ancestral throne and beheld him anointed with the holy water at the time of his coronation! Fortunate is Prince Lakshmana, who looks on the moon-like, lotus-eyed resplendent face of Rama, each day. Blessed is the daughter of King Janaka, who follows Shri Rama, the Lord of earth and ocean! Blessed also is Cittrakuta, equal to the Himalayas, on which Shri Rama dwells, as Kuvera and Cittraratha dwell in the forest. Blessed is this forest to-day, abounding in poisonous serpents and difficult to penetrate, because the mighty warrior Rama abides in it.\u201d", "Thus speaking, the valiant Prince Bharata entered the forest on foot. The chief of eloquent persons, the pious Bharata, reached the centre of the forest, where blossoming and fruitful trees adorned the mountain heights. Climbing a shala tree, he saw the smoke rising from the fire in Rama\u2019s hermitage. The prince with his friends rejoiced like those who have crossed the ocean, to find the dwelling place of Rama. Finding that Shri Ramacandra dwelt on the mountain frequented by ascetics, Shri Bharata, leaving his army behind, in the company of Guha speedily started for the hermitage.", "Shri Bharata with great eagerness pointed out the indications of the position of Shri Rama\u2019s hermitage to his brother Shatrughna. He appealed to Shri Vasishtha to bring his mothers there speedily, while he, devoted to his elder brother, hastily went on before. Sumantra followed Shatrughna, who walked behind Bharata and who was equally anxious to behold Rama. The prince, proceeding, at length descried the hut thatched with leaves in the midst of the hermitages of the ascetics, and beheld before it a heap of broken wood and flowers plucked for worship. To mark the site of the ashrama, Shri Rama and Lakshmana had bound kusha grass and strips of cloth to the trees. He perceived also great heaps of the dung of deer and buflaloe, dried for fuel, to be used in winter.", "The illustrious and mighty Bharata going forward, spoke measured words to his brother and counsellors, saying: \u201cI deem we have reached the place spoken of by the Sage Bharadvaja, and that the river Mandakini is not far distant from here! Prince Lakshmana has bound strips of cloth to the trees, so that when fetching water on a dark night, he may know the way back to the hermitage. This appears to be the road traversed by the great elephants who were roaring in the forest. I perceive the black smoke rising from the ascetics\u2019 sacrificial fire. Here, I shall behold that Lion among men, Shri Rama, the great preceptor, seated in majesty, like a resplendent sage.\u201d", "Proceeding a little further, Prince Bharata reached the river Mandakini on Cittrakuta, and addressing his companions, said: \u201cThat chief of men, a very god among living beings, is seated in this lonely forest in the posture of an ascetic. Woe unto me, wretched is my life and birth, on account of which the most resplendent Lord of all, Shri Ramacandra is plunged in this affliction and dwells in the forest deprived of all joy! Despised by men because of this, I will now fall at the feet of Rama and Sita in order to propitiate them.\u201d", "While still lamenting, Bharata perceived the hut thatched with leaves, pure and pleasant, covered with the leafy boughs of sala, tala and other trees, resembling an altar covered with kusha grass.", "Here and there mighty bows and shields covered with gold, wielded in battle, hung, adding to the beauty of the place, and nearby stood a quiver of arrows, bright as the rays of the sun, and keen as the serpents with shining hoods of the Bhagavati river. There also were two scimitars in scabbards of gold and two shields emblazoned with golden flowers, also many deerskins and gloves with gold embroidered gauntlets. That habitation was impregnable as a cave and unassailable by the herds of wild deer.", "Bharata discerned in this dwelling, Shri Rama seated near the altar, resplendent as fire. For a long time, Shri Bharata gazed on the beauty of the scene. He saw Rama sitting, his matted locks coiled on the crown of his head, shining like a flame, his body clad in a robe of bark, covered with the skin of a black antelope, his shoulders resembling a lion\u2019s, his arms were long, his eyes like lotuses, that ruler of earth and ocean, the sovereign of eternal decrees! Shri Bharata beheld that righteous one with Lakshmana and Sita, seated on a platform strewn with kusha grass, appearing like the eternal Brahma.", "Beholding him seated thus, the pious Bharata was overpowered with sorrow and affection, and ran towards him, his throat choked with grief, weeping and lamenting. Though the pain was past restraining, he yet mastered it and spoke: \u201cAlas! my elder brother, worthy of a seat in the royal assembly, beloved of his counsellors, is to-day associating with wild beasts in the forest. He, deserving of apparel adorned with thousands of golden coins, is sitting, clad in a deerskin, in order to practise the obligations of righteous living. Shri Rama, who was formerly adorned with garlands of different flowers, how can he endure the weight of his matted locks? He, who should have acquired merit by the performance of sacrifices aided by the rishis, to-day increases his meritorious deeds by the practice of austerity. Now is the countenance of my elder brother, formerly adorned with sandal paste, covered with dust! Alas! it is on my account that Shri Rama, who formerly enjoyed every delight, is to-day undergoing this distress. Woe unto me, who am abhored by all.\u201d", "Thus lamenting, the wretched Bharata, his face bedewed with tears, sought to run and fall at the feet of Rama, but sank unconscious on the way. Deeply afflicted, that great hero, Prince Bharata, cried out: \u201cO Excellent One,\u201d and uttered no more. Exclaiming only, \u201cO Noble Sire\u201d, he could proceed no further. Shatrughna, also weeping, embraced the feet of Shri Rama, on which Rama gathering them both in his arms, melted into tears.", "Then Sumantra and Guha approached Shri Rama and Lakshmana, and it appeared as if the Sun and Moon, Jupiter and Venus had conjoined in the heavens. The inhabitants of the forest, beholding the four princes met together in their midst, shed tears of joy.", "[Full title: Shri Rama enquires of Prince Bharata concerning the discharge of his royal duties].", "Shri Ramacandra saw Bharata lying on the ground, clothed in ascetic\u2019s garb, his hair coiled on the crown of his head, his palms joined in supplication, resembling the sun bereft of splendour, fallen to earth, at the time of the dissolution of the world.", "Taking hold of the hands of his brother, who was emaciated and weak, Shri Rama raised him up and smelling his head, embraced him, clasping him in his arms and tenderly enquiring of him: \u201cO Child, where is your father, that you are come to the forest alone? Had he lived, you couldst not have come hither unaccompanied! Alas! I grieve that I scarcely recognize my brother, thin, weary and full of care. What brings you to the forest? O My Brother, is the king well and happy? Or has grief brought about his end? O Darling, you are yet a child, tell me, is ought amiss in that eternal kingdom? O Hero of Truth, hast you served the king well? Say, is that Sovereign of men, devoted to truth and to duty, the performer of the great sacrifice, in good health? Is that highly learned monarch, master of the ascetic brahmins, fully cherished? O Child, are Mother Kaushalya and Queen Sumitra, mother of an illustrious son, well? Is that highly exalted Queen Kaushalya, happy? O Friend, dost you sufficiently regard that humble, experienced, highborn, magnanimous companion of mine, he who is skilled in action, the son of Shri Vasishtha? Does the royal priest, highly versed in the Veda, who is wise and beneficent, inform you of the time of sacrifice? O Brother, dost you offer full reverence to the Gods, father, mother, Guru, thine elders, the physicians and brahmins? O Friend, dost you give due respect and honour to Sudhama, skilled in the science of arms and conversant with the mantra-driven weapons? Hast you made those your counsellors, who are trustworthy, patient, masters of ethics and who have transcended avarice? O Prince, the good fortune of kings is secret consultation with those versed in the spiritual laws. My Son, hast you overcome sleep? Dost you awaken betimes? Dost you in the late hours meditate on the methods of acquiring legitimate wealth? Dost you reflect alone on matters of moment and consult with your ministers in public? Do other monarchs know of your decisions before they are applied? When you have determined upon what must and should be done, dost you speedily accomplish it? Are lesser kings acquainted with your determined resolve after the event or before you have set it in motion? Dost you prefer the society and advice of a learned pundit to that of countless fools? In times of adversity, it is of infinite advantage to have the proximity of a learned man. If a sovereign surround himself with ten thousand ignorant persons, he will receive no help from them, but should a king be attended by a wise minister, thoughtful, studious, versed in the moral laws and government, he will reap a great advantage.

That monarch who does not condemn a man to death, who has through avarice and deluded by ambition, accused others who are virtuous, and even threatened the life of the king, is himself destroyed!

I am wholly dependent on my noble brother, O You whose complexion resembles the lotus, who art pleasing to look upon and chaste? O Lady of large eyes, you are a paragon, do you become the consort of that matchless hero. Renouncing that ugly, evil and peevish old woman, whose limbs are deformed, he will certainly devote himself to you 1 O Lady of ravishing complexion and lovely limbs, what sensible man would sacrifice that unrivalled beauty of thine for an ordinary woman?\u201d", "Thinking Lakshmana\u2019s words to be sincere and not understanding his jest, that cruel and misshapen Rakshasi, in the blindness of her passion once more addressed Rama, the Scourge of His Foes, who was seated in the leaf-thatched hut with Sita, and said:\u2014", "\u201cIs it for this hideous, evil and peevish woman, who is old and deformed, that you dost slight me?", "\u201cI shall devour her in your presence to-day, and shall live happily with you without a rival.\u201d", "Speaking thus, the Rakshasi, whose eyes blazed like torches, hurled herself in fury on Sita, like a great meteor descending on the planet Rohini.", "Then the mighty Rama restrained her, as, like the noose of death, she advanced towards Sita, and in anger addressed Lakshmana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt is unwise to taunt those beings who are vile and cruel, O Saumitri. Take heed, see, Vaidehi is in danger, O Friend! Do you maim this hideous demon of protruding belly, who is evil and filled with fury.\u201d", "The valiant Lakshmana, highly incensed against the Rakshasi, thereupon drew his sword from its scabbard and, in the presence of Rama, cut off her ears and nose.", "Her ears and nose severed, Shurpanakha uttered a terrible cry and ran into the forest. Being mutilated, the Rakshasi, streaming with blood, created a terrible uproar, like a tempest in the rainy season and, dripping with blood, that hideous monster, lifting up her arms, plunged howling into the deep woods.", "Thereafter the injured Shurpanakha sought out her brother Khara of great might, who, surrounded by a troop of demons, was seated in Janasthana and threw herself on the ground before him, like a meteorite falling from heaven.", "Wild with terror and covered with blood, Khara\u2019s sister, almost deprived of her senses, related everything concerning Raghava\u2019s arrival in the forest with his consort and Lakshmana and the circumstances of her disfigurement.", "Seeing his sister lying on the ground, mutilated and streaming with blood, the demon, inflamed with anger, said to her:\u2014", "\u201cRise! Tell me why you are distraught; master your terror and narrate lucidly, who has disfigured you in this fashion. Who has dared to touch a black and venomous serpent, stretched peacefully beside him, with his foot?

How is it that you are found in this sorry plight? Amongst Gods, Gandharvas, mighty Sages and other Beings, who is sufficiently powerful to have disfigured you? I know of none in all the worlds who would dare to provoke me, save it be Mahendra, He of the Thousand Eyes, who overcame the demon Paka.

I am unable to say if they be human beings or Gods. Between them, I saw a young and beautiful damsel of slender waist, adorned with many kinds of jewels, and it is on account of this youthful woman that I am reduced to this plight, like one uncared for and set at naught on account of her infidelity. I wish to drink the blood of this woman and those two youths on the battlefield.\u201d", "Hearing his sister utter these words, Khara, mad with anger, called on fourteen demons of great strength, equal to Antaka himself, and said to them:\u2014", "\u201cTwo men furnished with weapons, clad in bark and black antelope skins, have ventured into the inaccessible Dandaka Forest in company with a youthful woman; do you slay them and also that wretch herself. My sister desires to drink their blood! O You Rakshasas, this is my sister\u2019s dearest wish, go therefore with all speed and in your great might destroy them. On seeing the two brothers struck down by your blows, my sister will drink their blood on the field, with joy.\u201d", "Receiving this command, the fourteen demons swiftly departed, accompanied by Shurpanakha, like clouds driven before the wind.", "The cruel Shurpanakha, having reached Raghava\u2019s hermitage, pointed out the two brothers and Sita to the demons, and they beheld Rama, full of valour, seated in his hut of leaves, in company with Sita, attended on by Lakshmana.", "Seeing Shurpanakha and the demons who accompanied her, the illustrious descendant of the House of Raghu, Rama, said to Lakshmana who was burning with courage:\u2014", "\u201cStay a moment with Sita, O Saumitri, so that I may slay these demons who have followed the Rakshasi.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Rama, versed in knowledge of the Self, that prudent offshoot of the House of Raghu answered with deference, saying: \u201cBe it so.\u201d", "Then the righteous Raghava, stretching his great bow, inlaid with gold, addressed those demons, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWe are the sons of Dasaratha, two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who have come with Sita to the inaccessible Dandaka Forest. Living on roots and fruit, with our.senses under control, we practice penance and the brahmacarya vow and pass our days in the woods. Why do you seek to do us injury, wretches that you are? It is at the request of the Sages, that I have come hither to castigate you for your evil deeds on the field of battle. Halt where you stand and advance no further! If you desire to live, turn back, O Prowlers of the Night.\u201d", "At these words, those slayers of brahmins, the fourteen demons, bearing spears in their hands, inflamed with anger, their eyes red, terrible to behold, filled with a fierce exultation, answered Rama, whose fiery glances and sweet speech manifested a courage they had not seen till that hour, and said:\u2014", "\u201cFor having incurred the displeasure of our master, the most magnanimous Khara, you are about to fall under our blows in battle. What power hast you single-handed to slay so many in the field; it is you who shalt lose your life to-day in this conflict. Our arms bearing maces, spears and darts will rob you of your strength, and your bow shall fall from your hand.\u201d", "Thus speaking, the fourteen demons, brandishing their formidable weapons, hurled themselves on Rama, letting fly their spears at the invincible Raghava, but Kakutstha with as many arrows tipped with gold cut off those fourteen spears. And that illustrious warrior, full of wrath, taking out more arrows, which had been sharpened on stone, seized his bow and placing them on the string, made the titans his target.", "Then Raghava, loosing those shafts, as Indra his thunderbolt, speedily pierced the breasts of those demons, and the arrows, all bloody, penetrated the earth like serpents disappearing into an ant heap.", "With their breasts pierced by those arrows, the demons fell to the ground, like trees, whose trunks have been severed.", "Bathed in blood, mutilated, bereft of life, they lay stretched on the earth, and Shurpanakha, seeing them thus, blind with rage, sped away, to seek out her brother Khara.", "Wounded afresh, the blood coagulating like a tree exuding resin, Shurpanakha fell down before her brother and in his presence set up a mighty uproar, wailing and shrieking, raining tears, her features distorted.", "Having seen the demons fall on the field of battle, Shurpanakha, returning in all haste to her brother Khara, described their deaths to him in every detail.", "Seeing Shurpanakha beside herself, lying on the ground, having returned without accomplishing her design, Khara addressed her in harsh tones, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHave I not placed those valiant demons, living on flesh at your disposal, for your pleasure? Why dost you still complain? They are zealous, loyal and have ever been my trusted servants. Though invincible, even had they to die, they would not disobey me. What is this? I wish to know the reason why you are rolling on the earth like a serpent, crying \u2018O, my Lord Why, since I am your protector, dost you lament like one abandoned? Rise, rise! Let us have no more of these tears and swoonings.\u201d", "Thus did Khara, her brother, speak to that terrible Rakshasi to comfort her, and she, wiping away her tears, said:\u2014", "\u201cWhen I came hither with my nose and ears severed, drenched in blood, which flowed forth like a river, you didst console me. To please me, you didst command fourteen valiant demons to slay the ruthless Rama and Lakshmana. These demons, incensed against Rama, armed with spears and pikes, have fallen victims to his murderous arrows, in combat.

Then, after a space coming to her senses, exercised with grief, she continued to cry out and strike her breast with her hands.", "Listening to Shurpanakha\u2019s reproaches, Khara, burning with anger, seated amidst his warriors, answered fiercely:\u2014", "\u201cYour contempt incites me to ungovernable fury, I am beside myself and can no more endure this than it is possible to support salt poured into a wound. I hold Rama to be of no account and regard him as already dead. His offence will bring about his end this day; therefore restrain your tears, do not distress thyself further. I shall despatch Rama and his brother to the region of death, and you, O Rakshasi, shalt to-day drink the warm blood of that one of evil deeds struck down by mine axe.\u201d", "Overjoyed on hearing these words, falling from her brother\u2019s lips, Shurpanakha, in her folly, began to praise Khara, the Foremost of Titans.", "First condemned, then extolled by her, Khara called on Dushana, the commander of his army, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Friend, make ready fourteen thousand trained titans who are obedient to my commands, full of martial ardour, who never retreat in battle, who resemble thunder clouds and who revel in cruelty and delight in slaying men.", "\u201cDo you, with all speed, bring my chariot also, with bows, arrows, glittering swords, darts and javelins, that have been well sharpened.

Decorated with symbols of good fortune, such as fish, flowers, trees, rocks, mountains, birds and stars, it was furnished with banners and spears, hung with delightful bells and yoked to excellent steeds.", "Then Khara, chafing with impatience, as also Dushana, seeing that great host, furnished with chariots, shields, weapons and banners, cried to that multitude of demons:\u2014\u201cAdvance!\u201d", "Thereafter that mighty titan army, numbering fourteen thousand, equipped with formidable shields, weapons and banners, rushed out impetuously, amidst a great tumult.", "Armed with hammers, picks, spears, sharp axes, sabres, discus and shining javelins, as well as darts, formidable clubs, immense bows, goads, swords, maces and thunderbolts, terrible to look upon, those ferocious titans, obedient to the commands of Khara, left Janasthana, and he, withdrawing himself a little, reviewed those titans of malignant aspect, who were rushing forth, and thereafter followed them.", "Obedient to Khara\u2019s command, the charioteer mounted on the car of that Slayer of His Foes, spurring on his dappled steeds, whose harness was wrought with pure gold, advanced with all speed, causing the cardinal points and other regions to ring with the sound.", "And Khara, in harsh tones, inflamed with anger, chafing with the desire to destroy his adversary, endowed with great strength, equal to Antaka, urged on his charioteer again and again, roaring like a great cloud about to let loose a stream of hail.", "At that time terrible portents appeared and from a dark cloud a shower of blood fell. The swift-footed steeds yoked to Khara\u2019s chariot, stumbled on the level road of the royal highway, strewn with flowers; the sun was covered with a black disc, edged, as it were with blood, like a circle of burning coals, whilst a frightful vulture settled on the standard with its golden support.", "Birds and beasts of prey, roaming in the vicinity of Janasthana, emitted deafening cries, creating an appalling clamour, and near that region, terrible jackals gave forth fearful and bloodcurdling howls, like fiends.", "Immense and formidable thunderclouds resembling elephants with crushed Temples, showered down a rain of blood, which hid the entire firmament; a great darkness fell, causing the hair to stand on end, obscuring the four quarters. Dusk arrived before the appointed time, assuming a sanguinous hue and, as Khara proceeded, wild beasts and birds of terrifying aspect barred his path, whilst herons, hyenas and vultures raised a ghastly clamour.", "Hideous jackals, a sign of misfortune in war, howled at the approaching army, flames darting from their jaws and a headless trunk, resembling a club, was seen close to the sun. Though the time of eclipse had not come, yet that golden orb was seized by the planet Svarbhanu; the winds blew violently and the sun was bereft of lustre; though not yet night, stars thick as fireflies appeared.", "Birds and fishes dived into the depths of the lakes, on which the lotuses had withered, and in that hour the trees were bereft of flowers and fruit, and sombre dust-clouds arose without the stirring of the wind. Parrots called wildly \u2018Cicikuci\u2019 and comets of sinister aspect fell without a sound; the earth with her mountains, woods and forests, shook.", "As Khara, standing in his chariot, was raising his war-cry, his left arm twitched and his voice died away; glancing round on every side, his eyes were suffused with tears, his head throbbed, yet in his folly he did not turn back.", "Witnessing these evil portents that caused his hair to stand on end, with a defiant laugh, Khara addressed that host of titans saying:\u2014", "\u201cI hold these terrible portents, dreadful to behold, as nought compared with my power and disregard them as do the strong, the weak! I am able to shoot down the stars from heaven with my sharp arrows! I can subjugate the empire of death itself!

May my sister, for whose sake I have sworn to bring about the death of Rama and Lakshmana, drink the blood of these two. Till this hour, I have not known defeat on the field of battle; you are witness to it, I do not utter falsehood!

Behold, O Lakshmana, smoke rising from mine arrows, as if they rejoiced at the coming contest, and my bow of beaten gold moving of itself, eager for action. Meseems the cry of wild birds that frequent the woods foretells danger, nay, that the very lives of our foes are in jeopardy. Assuredly a great battle will shortly take place; the twitching of my left arm betokens it. O Hero, for us victory is imminent, and the defeat of the titans assured. Your countenance is resplendent and exultant, O Lakshmana! Those warriors who enter into combat with a rueful mien are lost.", "\u201cI hear the roar of those titans of cruel deeds and the sound of their drums. If a prudent man desires success and wishes to escape defeat, he should be forearmed against the future. Therefore, bearing your bow and arrows, taking Sita with you, repair to a mountain cave, screened by trees and difficult of access. O Lakshmana, do not oppose my commands, but, swearing obedience to my feet, go thither, O Friend, without delay. You are valiant and well able to strike down the titans, but I desire to slay these Prowlers of the Night single-handed.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Lakshmana, taking up his bow and arrows, withdrew with Sita to an inaccessible cave.", "As Lakshmana entered the cavern with Sita, Rama rejoiced at his brother\u2019s submission and donned his coat of mail.", "Clothed in armour that shone like fire, Rama resembled a mighty flame illumining the darkness, and that hero, standing erect, took up his bow and arrows and, by the twanging of the cord, caused the four cardinal points to re-echo.", "Then the Gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas and Caranas gathered together to witness the struggle and the great-souled Rishis began to converse one with the other, saying:\u2014", "\u201cMay it be well with all the cows and brahmins found on the earth!

In his anger, Rama resembled the Bearer of the Pinaka bow intent on destroying Daksha\u2019s sacrifice.", "With their bows and weapons, their cars and their armour, which shone like fire, the hosts of those eaters of human flesh resembled a mass of dark clouds at the hour of sunrise.", "Approaching the hermitage, Khara, in company with those who preceded him, beheld Rama, the Destroyer of his Foes, full of wrath, armed with his bow and seeing that mighty warrior, bow in hand, Khara ordered his charioteer to drive upon him with his car.", "Thus commanded, Suta drove his horses to where the illustrious Rama, wielding his bow, stood unmoved.", "Beholding Khara advancing on Rama, the titans, uttering loud shouts, surrounded him on all sides, and he, stationed in his chariot amidst those Yatudhanas, resembled the planet Mars encircled by stars.", "Loosing a thousand shafts, Khara emitted a tremendous war-cry and all the demons in fury showered various missiles on that invincible archer Rama, striking him in their frenzy with iron clubs, swords, spears and axes.", "With their colossal stature and extraordinary power, they resembled mountains as they bore down on Kakutstha with their chariots and horses.", "In their desire to overcome Rama, those demon hordes, mounted on elephants as high as the peaks of mountains, covered him with a hail of weapons, like great clouds letting loose their rain on the King of Mountains, and Raghava was hemmed in on all sides by those ferocious looking demons.", "As at evening time Mahadeva is surrounded by his satellites, so was Rama beset by the lances of the titans, but that prince received the missiles hurled against him as the sea receives the rivers that empty themselves therein. As the Himalayas remain unmoved, when struck by lightning, so did he, when those dreadful weapons tore his flesh. Pierced in every limb, the blood gushing forth on all sides, he resembled the evening sun enveloped in cloud.", "Beholding Rama encircled by thousands of titans, the Gods and sages were profoundly moved, but he, growing enraged, bending his bow like a sickle, let loose hundreds and thousands of pointed shafts, that could not be intercepted and carried death to those they pierced. As if in sport, on the battlefield Rama let fly countless arrows furnished with herons plumes, tipped with gold, destroying innumerable titans like the noose of death itself.", "Unconcernedly loosed by Rama, those arrows passed through the demons\u2019 bodies and, stained with blood, flew through the air like blazing torches. Countless shafts drawn from Rama\u2019s quiver fell in hundreds and thousands, robbing the demons of their life\u2019s breath, their bows, their banners, their shields and their armour, their arms embellished with ornaments and their thighs resembling the trunks of elephants.", "The arrows of Rama, discharged from the bowstring, cut down horses yoked to the chariots with their golden trappings together with the charioteers; elephants with their riders, horsemen with their steeds, were all transfixed by his shafts and despatched to the region of Yama.", "Pierced by those pointed shafts, the Rangers of the Night, emitted terrible shrieks, and decimated by those death-dealing arrows, the demon host was unable to defend itself, as dried wood is ignited by the proximity of fire.", "Then certain demon warriors, full of energy and zeal, in a paroxysm of rage, let fly lances, tridents and other weapons at Rama, but he, intercepting them, cut off the heads of those demons with his shafts, thus depriving them of their lives. They, having had their heads, their shields and their bowstrings severed, fell to the earth, like trees thrown down by the blast of Garuda\u2019s wings.", "Then the remaining titans fled, seeking refuge from those death-dealing arrows with Khara, but Dushana, taking up his bow, rallied them and rushed on Rama as if he were Antaka himself; thereafter the titans, growing bolder, hurled themselves on Rama anew, armed with the trunks of Sala and Tala trees and huge rocks.", "With lances, maces and snares, bearing darts, clubs and nooses in their hands, those great warriors covered the whole field with a hail of missiles, discharging volleys of trees and rocks. Thereafter the combat waxed furious, causing the hair to stand on end, and now it seemed as if Rama were the victor and again the demons appeared to triumph. Then, seeing himself beseiged on all sides, that mighty warrior Rama, covered by a hail of darts, sent up a terrific shout, placing the mantra-propelled Gandharva weapon on his bow, whereupon a thousand arrows sped from his bent bow, covering the ten regions.", "With such skill did Rama discharge his arrows, that the demons were unable to distinguish when he drew them from their quiver and when he loosed them and his shafts caused darkness to spread over the sky and obscure the sun.", "Slain in their thousands, the demons fell in heaps and the battlefield was strewn with corpses. Struck down, disembowelled, transfixed, torn and hacked asunder, they could be seen in their hundreds, and the ground was scattered with heads wrapped in turbans, arms encircled with bangles, thighs and torsos with their ornaments, horses, mighty elephants, shattered chariots, chowries, fans, umbrellas and standards of every kind, and beholding the slain, the remaining demons were afflicted and unable to withstand Rama, that captor of hostile citadels, further.", "Seeing his forces destroyed, the mighty-armed Dushana placed himself at the head of five thousand intrepid and invincible titans, to whom retreat was unknown.", "Armed with pikes, sabres, rocks and trees, they let loose a hail of missiles on Rama from every side, without being able to wound him. Their onslaught was formidable and to all but Rama, deadly. The virtuous Raghava, however, met the attack with his arrows, his eyes closed, as unconcerned as a bull under heavy rain. Thereafter, growing wrath, he resolved to destroy the whole of Khara\u2019s army and, burning with energy, covered that host and its leader, Dushana, with his shafts, whereupon Dushana, the Slayer of His Foes, met Raghava with weapons that resembled thunderbolts. Then the heroic Rama, enraged, severed Dushana\u2019s mighty bow, slew the four steeds yoked to his chariot and cut off the head of his charioteer with a crescent-shaped arrow, thereafter piercing Dushana\u2019s breast thrice with his shafts.", "Then Dushana lifted up his mace covered with gold, that resembled a mountain peak and was capable of destroying the army of the Gods. Studded with nails, smeared with the flesh of his foes, keen as a diamond, able to cut through the gates of hostile cities, that weapon, resembling a mighty snake, was wielded by that titan of evil deeds, who hurled himself on Rama.", "Nevertheless, as Dushana rushed upon him, Rama cut off both his arms with his arrows, and that mace, loosed from his grasp, fell forward on the field like unto the banner of Indra, whilst Dushana, bereft of it, his arms severed, sank to the earth like a mighty elephant that, stripped of its tusks, succumbs.", "Seeing Dushana lying on the battlefield, all beings, witnessing that conflict, cried out \u201cWell done! Well done!\u201d and paid obeisance to Rama.", "Meantime, impelled by fate, the three generals, Mahakapala, Sthulaksha and the mighty Titan Pramathin rushed on Rama; Mahakapala brandishing a great trident, Sthulaksha bearing a harpoon and Pramathin, a huge axe. Seeing them advancing, Raghava, taking out some sharp steel-pointed arrows, went forward to meet them, as one receives a guest, and the Delight of the House of Raghu severed the head of Mahakapala with a single arrow and assailed Pramathin with innumerable shafts, whereupon he fell to the earth like an axed tree; thereafter, Rama blinded Sthulaksha with his sharp arrows and, inflamed with wrath, with five thousand shafts slew an equal number of Dushana\u2019s followers, sending them to the nether regions.", "Hearing that Dushana and his warriors were lying dead, Khara, in great fury, addressed the leaders of the army, saying:\u2014\u201cLet all the titans attack that evil wretch, Rama, and strike him with weapons of every kind.\u201d", "Speaking thus, Khara, full of wrath, flung himself on Rama, followed by Durjaya, Karaviraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Hemamalin, Mahamalin, Sarpashya, Syengamin, Prithagriva, Vajnasatru, Vihangama and Rudhinashana, those twelve valiant generals with their forces, who fell upon Rama, discharging their excellent shafts.", "And Rama, endowed with supreme energy, with his gold and diamond encrusted arrows, despatched the remainder of Khara\u2019s forces, and those shafts, bereft of feathers, like golden stalks, resembling flames wreathed in smoke, laid those demons low, as lightning fells the giant trees. With a hundred earshaped arrows, Rama slew a hundred titans; and a thousand with as many shafts. Their breastplates and ornaments shattered, their bows broken, those Rangers of the Night fell on the earth, bathed in blood.

I swear to you by my sword that I will slay Rama and avenge the death of the entire demon host.

At that moment Khara deemed the destroyer of his forces, endued with heroism, the extremely powerful Rama, to be overcome with fatigue, but Rama remained unmoved under Khara\u2019s assaults, as a mighty lion ignores the presence of an insignificant deer.", "Then Khara, in his chariot blazing like the sun, drew near to Rama, as a moth approaches a flame and, displaying his skill, severed Rama\u2019s bow at the point where he held it, thereafter loosing seven mace-like shafts resembling Indra\u2019s thunderbolts, which shattered the armour of his adversary resplendent as the sun itself, so that it fell on the earth.

With one, he struck the head of Khara, with two others, his arms, and with the remaining three crescent-shaped darts, he pierced his breast.

And that righteous One discharged that shaft at Khara, which had been conferred on the Sage Agastya by Indra, and like a thunderbolt it struck his breast so that he, consumed by the flame issuing therefrom, fell to the ground.

Countless nymphs of celestial beauty, adorned with garlands and jewels, beguiled them with every kind of pastime in which they excelled, and the auspicious consorts of the Gods honoured them by dwelling amongst them, whilst Danavas and other Celestial Beings who fed on Amrita frequented that place. Swans, cranes, pelicans and waterfowl disported themselves on the emerald sward, wet and shining with the sea mist; spacious cars festooned with celestial garlands from which strains of sweet music issued, flew here and there at the will of those who had conquered the worlds by their austerities, together with Gandharvas and Apsaras.", "Ravana surveyed countless forests of sandalwood, whose roots were full of fragrant sap, delighting the olfactory sense, and groves of excellent Agallocha and Takkola trees with pear trees and bushes of black pepper and heaps of pearls lying on the shore, and coral reefs and gold and silver promontories, tumbling cataracts of crystal water and cities filled with grain and treasure, where the pearls of womanhood could be seen and which were thronged with horses, elephants and chariots.", "On the shores of the ocean, the Lord of the Titans beheld a level and charming spot over which cool breezes blew resembling heaven itself, in the centre of which grew a great fig tree, like a bright cloud, where many sages sheltered, and on every side its branches stretched to a distance of several yojanas. It was there that the mighty Garuda brought a huge elephant and a giant tortoise in his claws, wishing to devour them among the branches, but the bough broke under the weight of that enormous bird, and the Vaikhanasas, Mashas, Valakhilyas, Marichipas Ajas and Dhumras being assembled there, Garuda had compassion on them and transported the branch together with the elephant and tortoise in one claw to a distance of one hundred yojanas, where that excellent bird regaled himself on their flesh.", "Destroying the empire of the Nishadas with the severed branch, thus delivering the sages, his joy was re-doubled and his energy increased, whereupon filled with strength he resolved to steal the Nectar of Immortality. Having broken the iron bars, he entered the jewelled keep and bore away the Amrita from that place where it had been hidden by the mighty Indra.", "It was this same Nyagrodha tree, frequented by groups of great sages, that still bore the marks of Supama and was called \u2018Subhadra\u2019, that the younger brother of Dhanada now saw before him.", "Passing over to the further side of that Lord of the Waters, the Ocean, Ravana saw a solitary hermitage, an ancient and holy retreat in the middle of a forest.

With what purpose hast you come hither again so speedily?\u201d", "On hearing this enquiry, the mighty and eloquent Ravana answered in this wise:\u2014", "\u201cO Marica, listen to me as I relate everything to you!

Knowing his father to be deceived by Kaikeyi, yet filled with filial devotion he said \u2018I will redeem his pledge\u2019 and went into exile to the forest. To please Kaikeyi and his father Dasaratha, he renounced his throne and prerogatives in order to enter the Dandaka Forest. Rama is neither passionate nor is he an ignorant man, whose senses are unsubdued; what has been related to you is false and should never have been uttered.

The other fawns, approaching, snuffed its scent and then scattered in all directions, but that demon, who formerly had taken delight in slaying them, now, in order not to betray his real nature, abstained from molesting those who approached him.", "Meantime Vaidehi of brilliant glances was engaged in gathering flowers, diverting herself in the midst of the Karnikara, Ashoka and Cuta trees that she loved so well.

Truly exquisite, this gazelle and its counterpart in the heavens are both divine, the one amongst the stars and the other on earth, yet if you are certain that this is an illusion created by the titan, O Lakshmana, I will destroy it. That cruel and evil-souled Marica slew many great ascetics ranging in the forest; innumerable kings, armed with bows, hunting here, have fallen under his assaults when he assumed the shape of an illusive deer; let us therefore end his life.", "\u201cFormerly Vatapi oppressed the Sages here also, and, entering their stomachs, emerged, riving them, as the embryo of a mule may cause the death of its mother.", "One day that demon encountered the great Sage Agastya, gifted with divine powers and was devoured by him when presented in the form of an offering by his brother Ilvali; when the repast was concluded that titan called out \u2018Vatapi come forth\u2019 but the excellent Rishi, addressing Ilvali with a smile, said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Since being blinded by your power, many illustrious sages have fallen victim to you on this earth; your brother is now wholly consumed by me.\u2019", "\u201cO Lakshmana, this titan will also be annihilated like Vatapi for having set me at nought, who am fixed in my duty and master of my senses. He shall meet his end, as did Vatapi who defied Agastya. Do you remain here without absenting thyself and guard Sita with care. It is our first duty, O Delight of the House of Raghu! I shall either slay that deer or bring it back alive; till I return with the deer, which I shall do without delay, do you remain here with Sita, O Son of Sumitra. She shall have the fawn; its skin will cost it its life this day. Now keep watch over Sita in the hermitage. Till with a single arrow I have brought down this dappled fawn and slain it, do you stay here, O Lakshmana, with the mighty raven, Jatayu, who is strong and wise and ever engaged in pious acts, and protect Maithili in every way.\u201d", "Having issued this command to his brother, that invincible warrior, the Delight of the House of Raghu, endowed with great prowess, girded on his sword in its golden scabbard, and taking up his triply-curved bow, his personal insignia and two quivers filled with arrows, he set forth with long strides. Beholding that Indra among Men, the king of the beasts in fear disappeared only to re-appear once more.", "Girt with his sword and bearing his bow in his hand, Rama ran in the direction of the deer and beheld it in all its beauty, close to him. Bow in hand, fixing his eyes on the fawn as it fled into the forest, he saw it sometimes taking a single bound, and then, in order to lure him on, allowing him to draw closer. Timid and fearful, it would leap into the air, at times becoming visible and then disappearing in the depths of the thickets.", "As in the autumn, stray clouds pass across the moon\u2019s face, so that she sometimes shines in all her brilliance and at others seems far away, so appearing and disappearing, Marica, in the form of a deer, enticed Rama far from the hermitage.", "Kakutstha found himself, despite his exertions, thus beguiled and the fawn, feigning fatigue, would crouch in the grass or, the better to deceive him, join a herd of deer, but when Rama approached, it would take to flight once more, concealing itself, only to re-appear in the distance. Sometimes, in fear, it would make itself invisible, then, with Rama in desperate pursuit, it would appear in a far off thicket. Thereupon increasingly wrath, Rama drew out a death-dealing glittering arrow more brilliant than the sun\u2019s rays and placing it firmly on his bow, stretching it with great energy, let fly that shaft that resembled a fiery serpent.", "Loosing that flaming arrow, which resembled a lightning flash, fashioned by Brahma himself, that marvellous shaft, pierced the heart of Marica, who had assumed the form of a deer. Thereat, bounding into the air as high as a palm tree, the titan fell mortally wounded and lay on the earth, having but a few moments to live. On the point of death, emitting a terrible cry, Marica abandoned his assumed form.", "Recollecting the words of Ravana and reflecting on how to induce Sita to send away Lakshmana, so that in her isolation she might be borne away, Marica, deeming the moment to be at hand, imitating Rama\u2019s voice, cried out \u201cO Sita, O Lakshmana!\u201d", "Stricken to the heart by that extraordinary arrow, discarding his deer\u2019s form, Marica took on the huge shape of a titan. Then Rama, beholding that titan of formidable size, writhing on the earth about to die, his limbs covered with blood, remembered the words of Lakshmana and reflected:\u2014\u201cThe illusion created by Marica, spoken of by Lakshmana is manifest, it is Marica whom I have slain. What will Sita not do on hearing the cry of the stricken titan: \u2018O Sita, O Lakshmana\u2019? To what a pass will the mighty Lakshmana now have come?\u201d", "Thus did the virtuous Rama reflect, his hair standing on end and, having slain the titan in the form of a deer and heard his cry, a great dread seized him.", "That dappled fawn being slain, Rama speedily killed and seized the carcase of another deer and hastened towards the hermitage.", "Hearing that cry of distress, which seems to come from her lord, Sita said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cDost you not recognise the voice of Raghava?

It is for this reason that you dost remain indifferent to his plight; if he is in peril, of what use is my life?

O Vaidehi, have no anxiety I\u201d", "At these words, Sita, her eyes flashing with anger, answered:\u2014", "\u201cO You Evil-hearted Wretch, Obloquy of your Race, who delightest in Rama\u2019s misfortune!

By an excess of perfidy, you have accompanied Rama to the forest and, practising guile, lusteth after me, while assuming the form of a friend 1 Or hast you been engaged by Bharata as his agent? Your design as also Bharata\u2019s, shall not succeed, O Saumitri! How should I desire another after serving the lotus-eyed Rama as my lord? Rather would I yield up my life in your presence, O Saumitri; without Rama, I cannot maintain life on this earth for an instant.\u201d", "Hearing these cruel words, causing him to shudder, Lakshmana, the master of his senses, with joined palms answered her, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt is not for me to gainsay you; you are as a goddess to me.

Sinister portents present themselves to me!

O Lakshmana, I shall hang myself or enter into the fire, but I shall never approach any man other than Raghava!\u201d", "Thus protesting before Lakshmana, Sita, distraught, beat her breast with her hands and lamented.", "In the face of her despair, Lakshmana, distressed, sought to comfort her, but she refused to answer the brother of her lord, whereupon he, bending low before her, set out to rejoin Rama, looking back again and again.", "Stung by Sita\u2019s bitter words, Lakshmana, in his ardent desire to rejoin his elder brother Rama, set out without further delay.", "Thereupon Ravana, in the guise of a mendicant, availing himself of the opportunity, rapidly approached the hermitage with the purpose of seeking out Vaidehi. With matted locks, clad in a saffron robe and carrying a triple staff and loshta, that highly powerful one, knowing Sita to be alone, accosted her in the wood, in the form of an ascetic, at dusk when darkness shrouds the earth in the absence of the sun and moon. Gazing on Sita, the consort of Rama, Ravana resembled Rahu regarding Rohini in the absence of Shasi.", "Beholding that monstrous apparition, the leaves of the trees ceased to move, the wind grew still, the turbulent course of the river Godaveri subsided and began to flow quietly.

Being loyal, virtuous, honourable and devoted to the good of all, my lord, Rama, endowed with long arms and large eyes, was renowned throughout the world. Our father King Dasaratha, blinded by passion, in order to please Kaikeyi, did not install Rama, and when he came before his sire, in order to receive the crown, Kaikeyi addressed the following bitter words to him:\u2014\u201cO Ramacandra, hear from me the decree issued by your father. This great kingdom is to be given to Bharata and you are to dwell in the forest for fourteen years.

I am exceedingly aged, you are youthful and furnished with a bow, armour and arrows, mounted on a car, yet you shalt not escape without injury, if you seeks to bear Vaidehi away. You shalt no more be able to carry her away by force in my presence, than it is possible to destroy the wisdom of the Veda by logic.", "\u201cIf you are not afraid, O Ravana, then halt an instant and fight! You shalt fall on the earth as Khara before you! Rama, clad in robes of bark, who more than once vanquished the Daityas and Danavas in the field, would soon have slain you in combat. As for me, what can I do? The two princes are far away and undoubtedly you are fleeing in all haste in fear of them, You Wretch! Yet while I still live, you shalt not bear away the lovely Sita, the beloved consort of Rama, whose eyes resemble the petals of the lotus. Even at the risk of my life I shall render this service to the magnanimous Rama, as if to King Dasaratha himself. Stay! Stay 1 O Dashagriva, reflect but for a moment. O Ravana, I shall hurl you from your great chariot like a ripe fruit from its stalk 1 O Prowler of the Night, I challenge you to fight to the last.\u201d", "While Jatayu, the King of Birds, was speaking thus, Ravana, that Indra among Men, wearing golden earrings, his eyes red with anger, fell upon him and a terrible struggle ensued in the sky, resembling clouds impelled by the force of the wind; in that conflict Jatayu, King of Vultures, and Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, resembled two vast winged mountains.", "Then Ravana began to shower innumerable steel-pointed shafts on the mighty King of the Vultures, but he, the chief of those whose wings are their chariot, received them unmoved and with his feet and sharp talons that foremost of birds inflicted countless wounds on the titan. Thereupon Dashagriva, filled with fury, anxious to destroy his adversary, taking out formidable shafts, equal to the God of Death, drew his bow up to his ear and pierced the vulture with those arrows, which, flying straight at their target, penetrated it with their steely points.", "Seeing the daughter of Janaka, her eyes bathed in tears, in the titan\u2019s car, Jatayu, disregarding those shafts, hurled himself at his opponent and, with his claws that valiant prince of the feathered tribe broke that bow decorated with pearls and gems and the arrows also.", "Thereupon Ravana, transported with anger, seized another bow and covered him with a hail of hundreds and thousands of arrows. Buried beneath those shafts, Jatayu resembled a bird in its nest, but flapping his wings, he broke through that cloud of arrows and with his sharp claws snapped that mighty bow; with a stroke of his wings he shattered Ravana\u2019s blazing shield, that resembled fire, and brushed aside the flaming darts that encompassed him.", "Then Jatayu, in that conflict, slew the swift-coursing mules with demons\u2019 heads, harnessed with gold, and demolished the chariot of Ravana, furnished with a triple standard of bamboo staves, which was driven by thought alone, bright as fire, its steps studded with precious gems. With a single movement of his wings, Jatayu struck down the canopy, like unto a full moon, with the chowries and the titans who wielded them.", "His bow shattered, bereft of his chariot, horses and charioteer, Ravana sprang to the ground, clasping Sita to his breast. Seeing Ravana descend, his car destroyed, all beings voiced their delight and praised the King of the Vultures again and again, paying obeisance to him.", "Ravana, however, perceiving that winged hero to be failing through exhaustion and age, greatly encouraged, rose high into the air, clasping the daughter of Janaka to him. Though without a bow, his other weapons being broken in combat, possessing his sword alone, he clasped Janaki passionately to his breast. Then the King of the Vultures darted towards him, barring his passage, and said to him:\u2014", "\u201cO Insensate One, you are carrying away the beloved consort of Rama, radiant as lightning; it is to your perdition that you have brought about her abduction. Like thirsty men drinking water, you are swallowing poison, with your friends, kinsfolk, ministers, army and people. Those who through want of discrimination fail to foresee the consequences of their acts soon perish, as you too shalt meet thine end. Caught in the noose of death, whither will you flee? You are like unto the fish that swallows the hook as well as the bait. Assuredly those two invincible heroes, Offspring of the House of Raghu, will not brook the violation of their domicile. The deed that you have basely committed will be denounced by the world, as the path frequented by brigands is eschewed by honest people. If you are not a coward, fight, O Ravana, or pause an instant and you shalt lie dead on the earth, as did your brother Khara. Truly you are engaged in that which will prove your destruction, as one on the brink of death commits an impious deed. Those actions leading to evil are not undertaken even by the Lord of Creation, Svyambhu Himself.\u201d", "Uttering these harsh words, the valiant Jatayu swooped on the ten-headed demon and, seizing him in his claws, tore his flesh like the rider of a restive elephant. Inflicting deep wounds, he plunged his beak into his back and tore his hair with his talons. Thus assailed by the Vulture King, the titan, trembling with rage, pressing Vaidehi to his left side, foaming with anger, struck Jatayu with the palm of his hand, whereupon the mighty vulture Jatayu, the Destroyer of his Foes, hurled himself on Dashagriva and with his beak tore off his ten left arms. His arms being severed, in an instant as many others sprang up again, like serpents issuing from an ant heap, spitting forth poison.", "Then, in his anger, the mighty Dashagriva released Sita in order to beat off the King of the Vultures with his fists and feet, and a mighty struggle arose between those two intrepid combatants, the Chief of the Titans and the Foremost of Birds, until Ravana, drawing his sword, cut off the wings and feet of Jatayu, piercing the side of that champion of Rama. The Ranger of the Skies having sundered the two wings of that King of Vultures, Jatayu fell to the earth, at the point of death, and seeing him on the ground, bathed in blood, Vaidehi, exceedingly distressed, darted towards him, as to one of her own kin.", "Then the Lord of Lanka beheld that noble bird of exceeding prowess, with his yellow breast and plumage resembling a dark cloud, lying on the earth, like an extinguished torch, whereupon the weeping Sita, daughter of Janaka, whose countenance was like unto the full moon, pressed that winged creature, victim of the wanton Ravana, to her breast.", "Beholding that King of the Vultures struck down by Ravana, she whose face was as fair as the moon, stricken with grief, burst into lamentation, crying:\u2014", "\u201cVisions, omens, dreams and the cries of birds are the inevitable signs of good and evil fortune among men. O Kakutstha, because of me wild beasts and birds are fleeing away; dost you not understand that a great calamity has befallen me? O Rama, this bird, out of pity for me, sought to deliver me and now lies dying on the earth owing to mine evil fate! O Kakutstha, O Lakshmana, hasten to mine aid!\u201d", "Thus did that lovely woman cry in her terror, as if they could hear her, and the Chief of the Titans, Ravana, continued to pursue her, who, far from her protectors, bearing a faded garland, was calling for aid. Clinging to the trees like a twining creeper, crying: \u201cSave me 1 Save me!\u201d, she ran hither and thither pursued by the King of the Titans. Bereft of Raghava, who was far away in the forest, she was calling \u201cRama, Rama!\u201d when Ravana, resembling death itself, to his destruction seized her by the hair.", "At this outrage, the whole universe of animate and inanimate beings trembled and a profound darkness covered all. The wind grew still, the sun dim, and the Grandsire of the World, Svyambhu Himself, through his divine power seeing Sita overcome, exclaimed: \u201cOur purpose is accomplished 1\u201d Perceiving violent hands laid on Sita, the illustrious Sages inhabiting the Dandaka Forest, recognising that the destruction of Ravana was now assured, were filled with joy!", "The Lord of the Titans, however, laying hold of Sita who was weeping and crying out: \u201cRama! Rama I O Lakshmana!\u201d ascended with her into the air.", "Of the hue of molten gold, attired in a yellow sari, that daughter of a king resembled lightning athwart the clouds; her silken robe, streaming in the wind, lent Ravana the semblance of a blazing volcano, and the coppery and fragrant lotus leaves, falling from Vaidehi of incomparable beauty, covered him. Her yellow silken robe floating in the air resembled a cloud illumined by the setting sun, but her pure countenance, as she was being transported through space far from Rama, had lost its radiance, like a lotus detached from its stalk.", "Resembling the moon that rises from the heart of a dark cloud, Sita, her fair brows crowned with lovely locks, appeared like a lotus in flower that had lost its brilliance.", "With her sharp and brilliant teeth, glorious eyes, well-formed nose, sweet mouth and ruby lips, she resembled the moon, lovely to look upon, and transported through the air in Ravana\u2019s lap, her face, bathed in tears, shone as faintly as does that orb during the daylight hours.", "The golden-hued Sita seen against the dark-bodied titan looked like the girth of gold encircling an elephant. Like unto the yellow lotus, the daughter of Janaka with her shining ornaments irradiated Ravana as lightning illumines a thundercloud, and accompanied by the clashing of her jewels the King of the Demons appeared like unto a muttering cloud.", "As Sita was being borne away, the petals from her hair fell in a shower on the earth, and this rain of blossom, caused by Ravana\u2019s rapid flight, covered him also, as a wreath of stars encircles Mount Meru, and suddenly her anklet, encrusted with pearls, struck the earth like a flash of lightning.", "Like rosy twigs she covered the dark limbs of the King of the Titans with a radiance equal to the golden girth of an elephant and, as a mighty meteor illumines the heavens with its splendour, so was she borne through the air by the younger brother of Vaishravana.", "Her jewels, flashing like fire, fell tinkling on the earth, where they broke into pieces, like meteors falling from the firmament, and her chain of pearls, bright as the moon, fell from her breast, emitting a blaze of light, like the Ganges falling from heaven.", "The trees, sheltering a myriad birds, buffetted by the following wind that swayed the topmost branches, seemed to whisper \u201cFear not!\u201d and the lakes, carpeted with faded lotuses, filled with fish and stricken aquatic creatures, appeared to be weeping for Maithili as for a friend. Rushing in wrath from all sides, lions, tigers and other beasts and birds followed Sita\u2019s shadow, and the mountains too, with their cataracts like faces bathed in tears, their crests like arms upraised, seemed to lament for Sita, as she was being borne away. Beholding Vaidehi carried through the air, the glorious sun, oppressed with sadness, lost its brilliance and became but a pale disc.", "\u201cThere is neither justice, equity, nor truth, nor sincerity, nor kindness, since the consort of Rama, the Princess of Videha, is being carried away by Ravana.\u201d Thus did the assembled beings lament, whilst the young of the wild creatures, forlorn and terrified, emitted plaintive cries. Lifting up their eyes, glassy with fear, again and again, the forest Deities, trembling in every limb, witnessed the anguish of Vaidehi, who was being borne away so cruelly and who was constantly looking towards the earth and crying in faint accents: \u201cO Lakshmana, O Rama\u201d.", "The guileless Vaidehi, her hair streaming behind her, her tilaka effaced, was borne away by Dashagriva to his own destruction, and Maithili with her beautiful teeth and gracious smile, bereft of her friends, not beholding Rama or Lakshmana, grew pale and felt herself wholly crushed under the weight of her despair.", "Finding herself borne through space, Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, greatly alarmed and filled with distress, in an access of fear, her eyes red with tears and indignation, her voice broken by sobs, addressed that ferocious King of the Titans who was bearing her away, in plaintive tones, saying:\u2014,", "\u201cO Base Wretch, art you not ashamed of this act?

Wretch that you are, to bear away a woman who is defenceless and the wife of another! Your dishonourable exploit will be proclaimed throughout the worlds. Cursed be you, O Infamous Barbarian, who boasts of thine heroism! Cursed be such valour and prowess, O You, the Obloquy of your Race, cursed be you in the world, for your conduct! How should any restrain you who fleest so precipitately? Halt but for an instant and your life is forfeit! Should you come within the range of those two Kings of Men, you wouldst not survive for a single moment even were you supported by an army! As a bird is not able to bear the blazing forest fire, neither couldst you withstand the least of their shafts; therefore, for thine own good, release me instantly, O Ravana!", "\u201cProvoked by mine abduction, my lord with the aid of his brother will strive to destroy you if you dost not let me go. Thine evil intention, on account of which you dost seek to bear me away, that vile purpose, will never find fulfilment; for even were I never again to see my lord, who is endowed with supreme wisdom and should fall a victim to an enemy, I should not survive long.", "\u201cYou dost disregard thine own good and resemblest one who, in his last hour, chooses what is fatal to him; none who desires his end courts that which will save him. I see the noose of death about your neck, since you dost not tremble in this exigency, O Titan. Without doubt, you shalt see those golden trees, with leaves like sharp swords and the dreadful river Vaitarani flowing with blood and the terrible forest and Shamali tree, with its flowers of refined gold and its leaves of emerald, bristling with iron thorns.", "\u201cHaving offered this affront to the high-souled Rama, you shalt not survive the poison that you have swallowed, O Merciless One. You are caught fast in the noose of death; whither will you turn for refuge from my magnanimous lord? He who, in the twinkling of an eye, without his brother, destroyed fourteen thousand demons in combat, how should that hero, issue of the House of Raghu, skilled in the use of every weapon, full of valour, not pierce you with his pointed shafts, you who hast carried away his beloved spouse?\u201d", "With these defiant words and others uttered in plaintive tones, Vaidehi, borne away in Ravana\u2019s arms, addressed him, though filled with grief and fear. Yet, despite her distress and lamentations, Ravana continued on his way, bearing that sweet and gentle princess, still struggling to break free.", "Borne away by Ravana, Vaidehi, seeing none who would defend her, suddenly observed five powerful monkeys standing on the summit of a mountain.", "Thereupon that large-eyed princess of surpassing charms, let fall among them her silken mantle, bright as gold and her rich jewels. Reflecting \u2018May they convey the tidings to Rama\u2019, the beautiful Sita dropped her cloak and ornaments in their midst.", "In his anxiety the red-eyed Dashagriva did not observe this proceeding but these excellent monkeys beheld the large-eyed Sita, who did not move her eyelids as she was crying out. Then that Lord of the Titans, passing beyond the Pampa lake, his face turned towards Lanka, continued on his way, clasping the wailing Maithili. Although experiencing a transport of joy, Ravana in truth was carrying his own destruction in his arms, like a sharp-toothed and poisonous serpent.", "Coursing through the air, he left behind forest, rivers, mountains and lakes and speeding on like an arrow shot from, a bow he passed over that sanctuary of whales and crocodiles, the indestructible abode of Varuna, the refuge of rivers, the ocean. Beholding Sita borne away, the waters became convulsed and the great serpents and fish were startled.", "Then the voices of the Caranas and Siddhas could be heard in the sky, saying: \u201cThe end of Dashagriva is at hand! Ravana however, who symbolised death itself, bearing the struggling Sita in his lap, entered the city of Lanka.", "Reaching that capital with its broad and spacious highways, he entered the palace and penetrated into the inner appartments. It was there that the dark-browed Sita, a prey to grief and despair, was set down by Ravana in his own domain, as Maya sheds his illusion.", "Then Ravana addressed those demons of dreadful aspect, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLet none look on Sita without mine authority! It is my will that she have pearls, rubies, robes and ornaments to the extent of her desire! Whoever speaks harshly to her, either knowingly or unknowingly, will forfeit his life!\u201d", "Having spoken thus to the titan women, Ravana left the inner apartment and began to reflect on what more should now be done.", "Observing eight valiant, flesh-eating titans, that exceedingly powerful One, blinded by the boon he had received, after extolling their strength and heroism, said to them:\u2014", "\u201cEquipped with every kind of weapon, betake yourselves with all speed to Janasthana, where Khara formerly dwelt and, summoning up your courage, banishing all fear, establish yourselves in that place, which is now a desert on account of the massacre of the titans. A great and mighty army was entrenched in Janasthana, which, with Khara and Dushana, was destroyed in combat with Rama. Since that time, an inordinate rage which I am unable to control has taken possession of me, precluding all rest. I wish to avenge myself on my sworn enemy, nor shall I sleep till I have slain him in fight. In the hour that I bring about the death of the slayer of Khara and Dushana, I shall rejoice, as a beggar on the acquisition of wealth.", "\u201cEstablished in Janasthana, keep me scrupulously informed concerning Rama and his movements. Without respite, let the Rangers of the Night take action and constantly strive to bring about Rama\u2019s end.

Entering there, Ravana, the King of the Titans, observed Sita overcome with grief, surrounded by titan women, like a ship foundering in the sea at the mercy of a storm or a gazelle separated from the herd beset by hounds.", "Then Ravana approaching that princess, whose head was bowed and who was disconsolate, compelled her to view that mansion resembling the abode of the Gods, containing many storeys and spacious apartments, inhabited by innumerable women and enriched by countless gems, whilst flocks of birds filled it with their carolling. Graceful pillars of gold, ivory, crystal and silver, encrusted with emeralds and diamonds could be seen and celestial gongs resounded there.", "Ravana, in company with Sita, ascended the magnificent golden stairway, ornamented with burnished gold. Those lofty buildings possessed excellent windows of gold and ivory covered with golden trellises, and their marble floors were inlaid with precious stones that shed their lustre everywhere. Then Dashagriva showed Maithili the fountains and pools covered with lotuses and every kind of flower; all this did he bring to the notice of Sita who was overcome with grief; and after directing Vaidehi\u2019s attention to the splendours of the palace, that perverse wretch, with the intention of seducing her, said:", "\u201cO Sita, apart from the aged and the children, ten thousand titans, rangers of the night, all of whom are famed for their exploits, acknowledge me as their lord, and each among them has placed a thousand loyal servants at my disposal. This entire state, as also my life, is thine, O Large-eyed Lady. You are dearer to me than life itself! O Sita, become the queen of those numerous excellent women who are my wives. O Beloved, be my consort, it is to thine advantage. What boots it to consider aught else, do you give my proposal your consideration; it behoves you to look favourably on me, who am burning with desire.", "\u201cSurrounded by the ocean, this city of Lanka, extending for a hundred yojanas, can never be taken by storm, even by the Gods themselves with Indra at their head.

Deprived of his kingdom, without possessions, dedicated to ascetic practices, travelling on foot, what canst you hope from Rama, a mere man without resources?", "\u201cO Sita, I am a consort worthy of you, do you accept me; youth soon passes, O Darling; enjoy these delights with me. O Lady of charming mien, do not think of seeing Raghava again. How could he come hither even in thought? Who can fetter the impetuous wind in the sky or seize the pure flame of a brazier? None in the Three Worlds may snatch you from mine arms. Do you rule over this vast empire of Lanka and all beings, animate and inanimate; even I and the Gods shall be your servants. Laving thyself in the crystal waters, be happy and live in delight. Your former evil karma has been expiated by the time passed by you in the forest. It is here that you will be able to pluck the fruit of your good deeds. In my company, O Maithili, enjoy these garlands with their divine fragrance and these magnificent ornaments. With me do you disport thyself in the aerial chariot Puskpaka, bright as the sun, that was once Vaishravana\u2019s, which I won by my prowess in combat, that vast and beautiful car, swift as thought.", "\u201cYour countenance, flawless and lovely to look upon, pure as a lotus, is wan on account of sorrow and has lost its radiance, O Lady of lovely limbs and gracious features.\u201d", "Whilst he was speaking, the beautiful Sita covered her face that sparkled like the moon with the hem of her robe and allowed her tears to flow.", "Thereat the sinful Ravana, that Ranger of the Night, addressed Sita who was sunk in thought and forlorn, her cheeks pale on account of grief, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Vaidehi, do not fear to contravene dharma; the ceremony that shall consecrate our union is sanctioned by the Veda!

Mine abduction presages thine end and that of the titans and of those dwelling in the inner apartments.

Hearing those dismal sounds, causing him to tremble, Rama, seized with alarm, reflected: \u201cIs Vaidehi safe and well or has she become a prey to the titans? The cry raised by Marica in the guise of a deer, imitating my voice, if heard by Lakshmana, may cause him to leave Sita in order to come to mine aid! It may be that the titans have resolved to slay Sita and for this reason Marica, in the form of a gazelle, lured me away! Having brought me a great distance, that titan fell a victim to my shafts and feigning my voice, cried out: \u2018O Lakshmana, I am slain!\u2019 Is all well with them, deprived of my presence in the forest?

Already a prey to anxiety, Rama became even more distressed on seeing his brother thus cast down.", "Observing that he had left Sita alone in the solitary wood frequented by titans, taking Lakshmana by the left hand, he spoke to him in a gentle voice, in sad and reproachful tones, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAh! Lakshmana, you have done wrong to come hither, leaving Sita unprotected. O My Friend, how can this prove auspicious? Assuredly the daughter of Janaka has been slain or even devoured by the titans who range the woods!

Will not Kaushalya, her son dead, become the abject slave of Kaikeyi when, having accomplished her design, she rules the dominion with her son? If Vaidehi still lives, I will return to the hermitage, but if my virtuous spouse be dead, I shall yield up my life, O Lakshmana! If on returning to the ashrama the daughter of Videha, whose words were ever preceded by a smile, does not speak to me, I shall renounce my life.", "\u201cTell me, O Lakshmana, if Vaidehi is living or no, or whether in consequence of your leaving her that unfortunate creature has been devoured by the titans. Alas! The wretched Sita, so tender and fragile, never having experienced unhappiness, will be wholly desolate in mine absence. Did that titan, full of cunning and craft, crying out \u2018O Lakshmana\u2019, inspire you with fear? I surmise that Vaidehi, hearing that cry for help uttered in a voice resembling mine, besought you to find out what had become of me and you didst come hither with all speed. You have done an irretrievable wrong in abandoning Sita in the forest, thus affording those cruel and ruthless titans an opportunity for avenging themselves. Those flesh-eating demons are aggrieved on account of Khara\u2019s death and now, without doubt, have slain Sita. Alas! I am wholly submerged in an ocean of sorrow, O Destroyer of your Foes! What shall I do now; I tremble before that which awaits me 1\u201d", "Thus immersed in the thought of Sita, that paragon among women, Raghava hastened towards Janasthana in company with Lakshmana.", "Heaping reproaches on his younger brother, who was overwhelmed with distress, tormented by hunger, fatigue and thirst, Rama, sighing heavily, his countenance pale, a prey to despair, entered his hermitage and found it deserted.", "Returning to the ashrama, that hero ran hither and thither where Sita was wont to disport herself and, recollecting those haunts where she used to roam, he became distracted, his hair standing on end.", "Issuing from the hermitage, Rama, the Delight of the House of Raghu, continued to address Lakshmana in a faint voice, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHaving confided Maithili to your care during mine absence in the forest, why didst you abandon her?

Go!\u2019. While she thus continued to urge me, repeating \u2018Go\u2019, I spoke to her, seeking to reassure her, saying: \u2018I know of no titan who can excite Rama\u2019s fear; it is not he, but another who calls, O Sita. How should that illustrious warrior, the inspirer of awe in the Gods themselves, utter so base and shameful a word as \u2018save me\u2019?

O Lovely One, it does not become you to tremble like a low-born woman! Take courage, calm thyself and banish thine anxiety. There is none born, nor yet to be born in the Three Worlds, who is able to triumph over Raghava in the field in open fight. He is incapable of being defeated in combat, even by the Gods with Indra at their head.\u2019", "\u201cThus addressed by me, Vaidehi, distracted and shedding tears, uttered these cruel words:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Lakshmana, in thine extreme perversity you seeks to unite thyself with me on the death of your brother but you shalt never possess me!

Sita, whose speech was gentle, clear and sweet, whose beauty was enhanced by her curly locks, has grown pale, having fallen a prey to the titans and she has lost her radiance, as the moon in the mouth of Rahu.

What living being is not subject to adversity, which approaches like a flame and instantly passes away? Even so is the world. Did not Yayati, the son of Nahusha, fall from heaven overcome by ill fortune? In a single day the great Sage Vasishtha, the chief priest of our sire, was bereft of four hundred sons born to him; and the Mother of the World, the Earth herself, revered by all, is sometimes known to tremble, O Master of Koshala! The sun and moon, the eyes of the world, the very symbols of virtue by whom all things are ordered, suffer eclipse. Those great beings, the Gods themselves, are subject to fate, O Lion among Men; how much more man? It is said that even Indra and the Gods endure vicissitudes; it does not behove you, therefore, to lament.", "\u201cEven should Vaidehi be dead or carried away, O Raghava, it is not worthy of you to yield to despair like a common man. Thine equals are never moved even in the greatest perils but look on all with equanimity, O Kakutstha!", "\u201cO You Best of Men, after due consideration, discriminate between that which is good and that which is evil; persons of right wisdom are ever cognizant of what is right or wrong. Owing to the element of uncertainty, one cannot at once distinguish the advantage or disadvantage of a deed, but if one fails to act the desired result will not take place. Thus hast you often instructed me, O Hero, and who is able to teach you anything? Not even Brihaspati himself. Even the Gods are powerless to fix the limit of your wisdom, O You of Mighty Intellect.", "\u201cI would fain arouse the power that sorrow has quenched in \u2018you!

Seek out your perfidious adversary and put an end to his life I\u201d", "At these apposite words, full of wisdom, uttered by his younger brother Lakshmana, Raghava, regaining possession of himself, rallied his courage anew. Controlling his wrath, the long-armed Rama, leaning on his marvellous bow, said to Lakshmana:\u2014\u201cO My Friend, what should be done? Whither shall we go, O Lakshmana? How shall we find Sita again? Let us consider these things carefully.\u201d", "To these anxious enquiries, Lakshmana answered:\u2014\u201cIt is for you to search Janasthana which is inhabited by innumerable titans and covered with trees and.creepers of every kind. There, inaccessible cliffs, chasms and caves are to be found and dark caverns inhabited by herds of wild beasts, the retreat of Kinneras and the resort of Gandharvas; with me explore these places. As the mountains are not affected by tempest, neither can adversity daunt the wise such as you, O Lion among Men.\u201d", "Thus speaking, Lakshmana began to scour the forest, and Rama, still chafing under adversity, advanced holding his bow on which was strung a formidable steel-pointed shaft, when suddenly he beheld Jatayu, that excellent King of Birds, resembling a mountain peak, lying on the earth covered with blood. Seeing that great vulture, like unto the crest of a mountain, Rama said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cWithout doubt, here is the titan, who, ranging the forest under the guise of a vulture, has destroyed Sita, the Princess of Videha! Having satisfied himself by devouring that largeeyed princess, he is resting at ease; I shall pierce him with my dread and fiery shafts that fly straight to their target.\u201d", "Speaking thus, Rama, fixing a sharp arrow on his bow, ran towards him and in his ire it seemed he would destroy the earth, whose boundaries are the sea.", "Vomiting blood, that bird then addressed Rama the son of Dasaratha, in the mournful accents of one about to die, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO You of long life, that divinity whom you seeks in the great forest, as one does a healing herb,1 has been borne away by Ravana, as has my life also.", "\u201cO Raghava, in the absence of Lakshmana and thyself, that princess was seen by me, being dragged away by the allpowerful Ravana. Flying to the aid of Sita, O Lord, Ravana was thrown to the earth by me in the struggle that ensued, and his chariot and canopy shattered. With a stroke of my wing, I slew the charioteer, but being at the end of my strength, my two wings were severed by Ravana\u2019s sword, and he, seizing hold of Sita, the Princess of Videha, escaped into the air. That titan has left me here to die; do not slay me, O Prince.\u201d", "Receiving these precious tidings concerning Sita, Rama, dropping his great bow, embraced the King of the Vultures, and then, despite his resolve, fell to the ground overcome with grief and began to lament with Lakshmana. Seeing Jatayu alone in that perilous and isolated pathvay, moaning unceasingly, Rama, overwhelmed with pity, said to Saumitri:\u2014\u201cThe loss of my kingdom, exile to the forest, the abduction of Sita and the death of this Twice-born, renders my fate such that it would consume fire itself. Even were the sea filled to the brim and I to enter it this day, that Lord of the Rivers would dry up on account of my misfortunes.", "\u201cSuch is the adversity that encompasses me that there is none in all the worlds amongst animate and inanimate beings who is so wretched as I! On account of mine evil karma, this childhood friend of my sire, the mighty King of the Vultures, lies dying on the earth!\u201d", "Repeating these words again and again to Lakshmana who accompanied him, Rama began to caress Jatayu, passing his hand lovingly over the body of his father\u2019s friend. Thereafter taking the King of the Vultures, whose wings were severed and who was bathed in blood, in his arms, he said:\u2014", "\u201cWhere has Maithili gone, who is dearer to me than life?\u201d and having spoken thus, Raghava sank down on the earth.", "In the presence of the vulture, whom the terrible Ravana had struck down, Rama, full of compassion for all, addressed the son of Saumitri in these words:\u2014", "\u201cThis bird, who sought to defend my interests, has been mortally wounded in the struggle with the titan and for my sake now lies dying here. Its vital breaths are barely perceptible, O Lakshmana, its eyes are dim and it is unable to speak.", "\u201cO Jatayu, if it be possible for you, then say what has become of Sita and how you have come to this sorry pass. For what reason has Ravana carried away my dear one? How did that radiant and enchanting face, resembling the moon, appear at that time, O Best of the Twice-born. What words did Sita utter at that moment? What is the strength, the appearance and the karma of that titan? Where does he dwell, O Friend, answer me!\u201d", "Beholding Rama lamenting like an orphan, the virtuous Jatayu answered in feeble accents:\u2014", "\u201cSita has been carried away by that Indra of Titans, Ravana, that evil wretch who resorts to the aid of sorcery and is able to loose the wind and the tempest. O Dear Child, I being exhausted, that Prowler of the Night severed my two wings and, thereafter taking hold of Sita, fled in a southerly direction. My breathing is laboured and my sight dim, O Raghava, I see before me the golden trees with leaves formed of Ushira. The hour in which Ravana bore Sita away was that in which the loser soon recovers that which is lost, \u2018Vindya\u2019 is its name, O Kakutstha, and Ravana was unaware of it. Like a fish that swallows the bait, he will soon perish! Do not, therefore, despair of recovering Janaki; you will soon sport with her, having slain Ravana in battle!\u201d", "While the vulture was thus replying to Rama, blood and morsels of flesh flowed from his beak and, on the verge of death, retaining his consciousness, Jatayu added:\u2014\u201cRavana is the son of Vishravas and the brother of Vishravana!\u201d and thereafter yielded up his life.", "\u201cSpeak! Speak further!\u201d cried Rama, addressing him with joined palms, but the life-breaths, withdrawn from that vulture\u2019s body, were already dissipated. Thereupon the King of the Vultures fell on the earth, his legs, body and head stretched out and, beholding that bird resembling a mountain of vast proportions, that bird of reddened eyes, deprived of life, Rama, staggering under the weight of his misfortune, said to Saumitri in bitter tones:\u2014", "\u201cPassing many years happily in the forest, the resort of titans, this bird has at length given up his life 1 Having lived innumerable years, he now lies here inanimate! None can withstand the course of destiny! Behold, O Lakshmana, this vulture who died in my service having sought to protect Sita, and who has been slain by Ravana of superior power. He renounced the dominion bequeathed to him by his ancestors and sacrificed his life for my sake. Undoubtedly the virtuous practise courage, devotion and the fulfilment of duty, even in the animal kingdom, O Saumitri! I did not feel so keen a grief for Sita\u2019s abduction as for the death of this vulture, who has sacrificed himself for me, O Scourger of Your Foes!", "\u201cI hold this King of Birds in the same veneration as I did the illustrious and fortunate monarch, Dasaratha, O Saumitri! Do you bring fuel that I may ignite the pyre of that King of Vultures, who died for me. Placing the body of that protector of the realm of winged creatures on the funeral pile, who has been destroyed by the cruel titan, I shall cremate it. O King of the Vultures, O Magnanimous Being, cremated and blessed by me, depart, and ascend to those regions, further than which it is not possible to go and which are the abode of those who habitually offer sacrifice, those heroes who never retreat on the battle field and those who distribute land in charity.\u201d", "With these words, the virtuous Rama placed the King of Winged Creatures on the funeral pyre and, full of grief, ignited the flame as if performing the rite for his own kinsman.", "Thereafter, the illustrious Rama, accompanied by Saumitri, entered the forest and, killing a few fat Rohi deer, strewed the flesh on the green grass as an oblation to that bird. Tearing off the flesh of those deer and kneading it into balls, he offered it to the vulture in that pleasant forest land, placing it on fresh grass. Thereafter, in order that Jatayu might soon reach the celestial abode, he recited those sacred formulas uttered by the brahmins, after which the two princes repaired to the Godaveri river to offer water in honour of the kingly bird. Following the traditional rites, those two Descendants of Raghu bathed and performed the Udaka1 ceremony for the King of the Vultures, who, having fallen on the field of battle, had executed a glorious and difficult deed and now, blessed by Rama, had attained to the place prepared for him in the realm of the saints.", "Thereupon those two princes, after offering the last rites in honour of that excellent bird, as if to their sire, entered the forest, their minds set on the recovery of Sita, like Vishnu and Vasava, the Sovereigns of the Gods.", "Having performed the purificatory rites in honour of Jatayu, the two princes entered the forest in quest of Sita, proceeding in a south-westerly direction. Armed with sword, bow and arrow, those offshoots of the House of Ikshvaku followed a hitherto untrodden path, overgrown with bushes, trees and creepers of various kinds, which was difficult of access, with dense thickets on either side and of sinister appearance; nevertheless the two mighty warriors pressed on through that vast and dangerous wood.", "Having traversed Janasthana and covered a further three leagues, those brothers, endowed with great energy, penetrated into the thick woodlands of the Krauncha Forest, which resembled a group of clouds and presented a smiling aspect with its many brilliant flowers and the herds of wild deer and flocks of birds that inhabited it.", "After exploring this forest, anxious to behold the Princess of Videha once more, sometimes halting to bewail her disappearance, the two brothers resumed their journey, and covering a distance of three leagues came to the hermitage of Matanga.", "Having searched the whole forest filled with fearful beasts and birds and planted with innumerable trees and dense thickets, the two sons of Dasaratha beheld a cave in the mountain, deep as the region under the earth where eternal darkness reigns.", "Then those two Lions among Men, approaching that cave, perceived the vast shape of a female titan of hideous appearance. Fearful of aspect, she was an object of terror to weaker creatures with her loathsome countenance, vast stomach, sharp teeth, immense stature and harsh voice.", "This monster subsisted on the flesh of ferocious beasts and now appeared before Rama and Lakshmana, her hair dishevelled, and addressed them, saying:\u2014", "\u201cCome let us pass the time in dalliance together.\u201d Thereafter she laid hold of Lakshmana, who had preceded his brother and added:\u2014", "\u201cI am named Ayomukhi, I am thine; do you become my lord, O Hero! Let us give ourselves up to a long life of pleasure on the summits of the mountains and among the islands in the rivers.\u201d", "Hearing these words, the Slayer of his Foes, Lakshmana, full of wrath, drew his sword and cut off her ears, nose and breasts. Her ears and nose being severed, that terrible titan ran away with all speed, and when she had disappeared, the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, Scourgers of their Foes, hastily pressed on and entered the dense forest.", "Thereafter the mighty Lakshmana, full of loyalty, charm and nobility, addressed his resplendent brother with joined palms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI am conscious of a violent throbbing in my left arm and my mind is filled with apprehension, whilst on every side I perceive inauspicious omens; do you therefore hold thyself in readiness, O Great One, and follow my counsel; these different portents foretell imminent danger. The Vanchulaka bird is emitting fearful cries which indicate a speedy victory for us.\u201d", "Thereupon the two brothers courageously began to explore the entire forest, when a terrible clamour arose appearing to rend the trees; such was the uproar that it seemed as though a mighty wind had suddenly swept through the forest.", "Seeking to ascertain the cause of this disturbance, Rama, armed with a sword, bow in hand, advancing with his younger brother, beheld a titan of vast proportions, possessing huge thighs, standing before him. Headless, his mouth in his belly, covered with bristling hairs, in stature equal to a mountain, his complexion that of a dark cloud, terrible to look upon, his voice resounded like thunder.", "Shining like a lit torch, he seemed to emit sparks; his single eye, furnished with yellow lids opening in his breast, was strange and hideous and this monster, possessed of enormous teeth, was licking his lips. Despite their ferocity and size, he fed on bears, lions, deer and birds, catching them with his great arms at a distance of four miles. With his hands he seized hold of flocks of birds and herds of deer, which he put into his mouth.", "Having observed them a mile off, he obstructed the progress of the two brothers and stood awaiting them. That colossal, hideous and dreadful creature of sinister aspect, with his trunk and vast arms, fearful to behold, stretching out, seized the two valiant brothers and gripped them with all his strength.", "On account of his coolness and courage, the valiant Raghava remained unmoved, but Lakshmana, being a mere stripling and volatile by nature, began to tremble, and that younger brother of Raghava said to him:\u2014", "\u201cO Hero, behold how I have fallen into the power of this titan; do you leave me as an offering to the evil forces and go your way happily; you will soon be re-united with Vaidehi, this is my firm conviction! O Kakutstha, when you have regained the kingdom of your forbears and art installed on the throne, remember me!\u201d", "At these words, uttered by Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, Rama answered:\u2014\u201cHave no fear, O Valiant One, persons of your valour are never perturbed.\u201d", "Meanwhile the headless titan, of huge arms, the foremost among the giants, said to them:\u2014", "\u201cWho are you, whose shoulders resemble a bull\u2019s, armed with great swords and bows? It is fortunate indeed for me that by chance you have come within my range in this dangerous place. Say for what reason you have come here, where I wait ravaged by hunger, you who are armed with arrows, bows and swords and resemble bulls with pointed horns? Having approached me, your death is imminent.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the wicked Kabandha, Rama, his face growing pale, said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cWe have fallen from one danger into a greater one, O Hero; this ill chance may cost us our lives without our being able to rejoin our beloved Sita. The power of destiny over all beings is inexorable, O Lakshmana! See, O Lion among Men, how ill-fortune drives us to the last extremity; there is nothing that weighs so heavily on man as destiny. Even the brave, the mighty, the great and skilful warriors on the field of battle, overtaken by destiny, are swept away like banks of sand.\u201d", "Thus spoke that heroic and illustrious son of Dasaratha, filled with distress, his eyes fixed on Saumitri, while in his soul his composure was fully established.", "Seeing the two brothers fallen into his arms as if into a snare, Kabandha said to them:\u2014", "\u201cWhat ails you, O Foremost among Warriors? Since I am tormented with hunger, fate has destined you for my food and for this reason has deprived you of your wits.\u201d", "Hearing these words Lakshmana, though sore distressed, determined to display his valour and addressed Rama in words worthy of the occasion, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWe shall soon become the food of this vile demon, who with his vast and powerful arms subdues all beings; let us with our swords sever his arms with all speed, O Lord, or he will make an end of us. It is shameful for warriors to make away with those who cannot defend themselves like an animal deprived of its freedom that is led to sacrifice.\u201d", "These words infuriated the demon, who opened his terrible mouth wide, preparing to devour them, whereupon the two brothers, choosing a favourable moment, as if in sport cut off his two arms at the shoulders, Rama cutting the right and Lakshmana with a vigorous stroke of his sword, the left. Thereupon Kabandha, his vast arms severed, emitting loud shrieks which resounded through the earth and sky like thunder, fell upon the ground. Beholding his two arms severed and the blood flowing in streams, the unfortunate demon enquired of those two warriors in feeble accents:\u2014\u201cWho are you?\u201d", "Thus accosted, the supremely courageous Lakshmana began to extol the virtues of Kakutstha, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThis is Rama, the descendant of the House of Ikshvaku, known throughout the earth, and I am his younger brother, Lakshmana. Deprived of his kingdom by the Queen Kaikeyi, Raghava was exiled to the great forest, where he lived with his consort and myself. While this hero, mighty as a God, dwelt in that pastoral retreat, a titan bore away his consort, in search of whom we have come hither.", "\u201cAnd you, who art you, wandering in these woods emitting flames, your thighs sunk into your body?\u201d", "On hearing Lakshmana, Kabandha, calling Indra\u2019s words to mind, answered joyfully:\u2014", "\u201cWelcome to you, O Tigers among Men, beholding you is my salvation; for my good, you have cut off my arms. Do you hear, how, due to mine arrogance, I came to assume this monstrous shape. O Illustrious Ones, I shall relate all to you truthfully.\u201d", "\u201cO Long-armed Rama, formerly I was filled with unimaginable energy and courage; my beauty was famed throughout the Three Worlds and equal to the sun, the moon and Indra himself. Assuming a terrible form, I became an object of fear to all and struck terror into the hearts of the ascetics living in the forest.", "\u201cO Rama, on a certain occasion I incurred the wrath of a great Rishi named Sthulashira, whom I tormented in this loathsome shape, whilst he was gathering wild fruits. Fixing his gaze on me, he pronounced a terrible curse, saying:\u2014\u2018Do you retain for ever this fearful form, assumed by you in order to harm others!\u2019", "\u201cAppealing to that provoked ascetic to rescind his curse, he took compassion on me and said: \u2018When Rama cremates you in the lonely forest, having severed both thine arms, you shalt regain your great and wonderful form.\u2019", "\u201cO Lakshmana, know that I am really the son of Danu, who was extremely handsome to look upon; my present appearance is due to a curse pronounced by Indra on the field of battle.", "\u201cBy rigorous penances I gained the goodwill of Brahma, and he granted me the boon of longevity. Thereafter I was filled with pride and, thinking \u2018What can Indra do to me now\u2019, I challenged him to combat, whereupon he hurled his mace of a hundred edges at me. By the force of this weapon, my thighs and head were thrust into my body; I prayed to him to end my life, but he, saying: \u2018May the words of Brahma prove true compelled me to go on living. Then I addressed Mahendra, saying:\u2014\u2018How shall I live without food, since you have thrust my head and thighs into my body?\u2019", "\u201cThereat, Indra caused my arms to extend over four miles and placed a mouth with sharp teeth in my belly. Ever since, stretching out my arms, I wander in the forest and seize hold of lions, tigers and deer and put them into my mouth. Then Indra said to me: \u2018When Rama and Lakshmana cut off thine arms, you shalt attain heaven\u2019.", "\u201cSince then, O Great One, I have laid hold on every living being I have found in the forest and have been awaiting Rama to sever my arms; anticipating this, I have waited for death. Now, O Lord, you have come, be you blessed 1 None but you can put an end to my life; the words of the great Rishi have proved true, O Illustrious One. I will put my counsel at your service, O Bull among Men, and, when I have received the consecration of fire, will form a pact of friendship with you both.\u201d", "At these words of Danu, Rama, in the hearing of Lakshmana, answered him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cRavana has borne away mine illustrious consort, Sita, whilst I and my brother were absent from the hermitage. I am conversant only with the name of that titan but not with his form, nor are we acquainted with his strength, nor where he dwells. Helpless and distressed, we wander here and there in the forest; it behoves you to show your compassion to us. After gathering all the branches that are dry and have been broken down by elephants and digging a large pit, we will cremate you at the time indicated by you. Do you tell us who has carried Sita away and where she is to be found. Render us this great service, if you are acquainted with the truth.\u201d", "Thus addressed by Rama, Danu, skilled in speech, answered Raghava, saying:\u2014\u201cI am not possessed of divine foresight, neither am I acquainted with the Princess Sita, but being cremated by you, resuming my natural form, I shall be able to point out one to you, who will know what has become of her. Without being consumed by fire, I am unable to tell you who is acquainted with that titan who has carried Sita away. Through a curse, my foresight has been destroyed, O Raghava, and through mine own fault I have become an object of loathing to the whole world, but before the sun with his tired steeds withdraws behind the western horizon cast me into the pit, O Rama, and cremate me according to the traditional rites.", "\u201cCremated by you with due ceremonial, O Joy of the House of Raghu, I shall tell you who is acquainted with that titan. It is for you to seal a pact of friendship with him according to the law. O Raghava, that swift-footed hero will lend you his assistance.", "\u201cFor one reason or another, he has traversed the Three Worlds and there is nothing in the Universe that is not known to him.\u201d", "After Kabandha had spoken thus, those two warriors, the foremost among men, Rama and Lakshmana, sought out a hollow on the mountain-side and ignited a fire. With the aid of glowing brands, Lakshmana lit the pyre that burst into flame on every side. The vast trunk of Kabandha began to melt in the heat of the fire like a lump of butter, and later the powerful Kabandha, scattering the ashes, rose up from the pyre wearing spotless raiment and a celestial garland, and that handsome demon, his limbs covered with diverse ornaments, ascended a chariot of dazzling beauty drawn by swans, in his splendour illumining the ten regions. Thereafter, standing in the sky, he addressed Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLearn, O Raghava, by what means you shalt be able to recover Sita. There are six expedients[1] by which misfortune may be combated, and in the light of which all things should be considered. He who has fallen into the worst misfortune may find solace if he has someone with whom to share his lot, but you and Lakshmana are deprived of this consolation in the calamity that has befallen you through the theft of Sita. O Rama, you who art thyself the foremost of friends art in need of a friend. After due reflection, I see no possibility of success for you except by this.", "\u201cHearken, O Rama, to what I am about to tell you. There is a monkey named Sugriva, who was banished in anger by his brother Bali, the son of Indra.

O Lion among the Ikshvakus, fate is inexorable!", "\u201cDo you go hence with all speed, O Valiant Raghava, and seek out the powerful Sugriva. Without delay conclude an alliance with him and, swearing mutual loyalty in the presence of fire, unite thyself with that beneficent being. You should not disregard that King of the Monkey Tribe, Sugriva, who is of a grateful disposition, able to change his form at will and worthy of your friendship. You too will be able to accomplish his designs, but benefited by you or no, he will execute your purpose.", "\u201cThis son of Riksharajas\u2019 consort and of Bhaskara, wanders about restlessly on the borders of Lake Pampa and is at war with Bali. Laying aside your weapons, seek out the retreat of that monkey on the Rishyamuka Mountain without delay and enter into a bond of friendship with that inhabitant of the forest. That Foremost of Monkeys is conversant with all the haunts of the flesh-eating titans in the world and has thoroughly explored their retreats; there is nothing on this earth that is not known to him, O Raghava.", "\u201cAs long as the many-rayed sun continues to shine, O Scourge of Your Foes, he with his companions will search the rivers, the crags, the inaccessible mountains and the caves for your consort. He will send out his monkeys of vast stature to scour every region in order to find Sita, separation from whom has rent thine heart. He will seek for Maithili of lovely limbs even in Ravana\u2019s own abode.

Ranging over those lovely mountains, wandering from hill to hill and wood to wood, O Hero, you shall reach the lake Pampa covered with lotuses, free from boulders and gravel, whose level banks present no crevice and therefore no danger of falling. O Rama, its bed is sandy and it is covered with floating lilies; swans, ducks, herons and ospreys are heard calling sweetly on the waters of that lake; nor do they fear man, O Raghava, since none has ever hunted there. Do you feed on these birds, fat as butter, O Rama, as well as on Rohita, Cakratunda and Nala.", "\u201cO Rama, the devoted Lakshmana will offer you diverse and excellent fish, devoid of scale or fin, plump, possessing a single bone, which may be speared with arrows and roasted on the fire.

This lofty mountain was formerly created by Brahma and a virtuous man who sleeps on its summit and dreams of treasure will find wealth on waking, whereas an evil-doer who attempts to scale it will be seized by demons while yet asleep. There too, the trumpeting of the young elephants who disport themselves in the Lake Pampa can be heard. O Rama, in that part of the hermitage where Matanga lodged them, wild elephants of vast size, streaming with crimson ichor, rush to the lake, full of ardour, like great clouds; there they slake their thirst in the cool waters, that are limpid, pleasant and extremely auspicious to those who bathe in them and which exhale a sweet fragrance.

How beautiful are your two shining bows, glistening with perfumed paste, covered with gold and shining like the mace of Indra; the two quivers also, filled with sharp death-dealing and formidable arrows resembling hissing snakes; your two swords of immense length and size, encrusted with fine gold that gleam like serpents that have just cast their slough! But why do you not answer me?", "\u201cSugriva is the name of that virtuous King of the Monkeys, that hero banished by his brother, who roams the earth in great distress. I have come here under the orders of that magnanimous one, the Chief of the Great Monkeys. The illustrious Sugriva desires your friendship. Know me to be his minister, a monkey, the son of Pavana, ranging where I please and coming here under the guise of a wandering monk from the Rishyamuka Mountain in order to please him.\u201d", "Having addressed those two heroes, Rama and Lakshmana, in discreet and courteous terms, Hanuman fell silent and hearing that speech, the blessed Rama, delighted, addressed Lakshmana who stood beside him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThis is the minister of the King of the Monkeys, the magnanimous Sugriva, whom I seek. O Saumitri, answer Sugriva\u2019s counsellor who is eloquent and warm-hearted and the subduer of his foes in courteous terms. Only one versed in the Rig-Veda and, who is conversant with the Yajur and the Sama Vedas, would speak thus. He has studied grammar thoroughly, and though he has spoken at length, it has been void of error. I see naught to offend, either in his mouth, his eyes, his brow, limbs, or attitude. His speech is neither lacking in fulness, depth, assurance or distinction; his voice issues from his breast in clear modulated tones. He expresses himself with admirable felicity without any hesitation; his tone is harmonious and moves the heart agreeably. What foe, having drawn his sword, would not be disarmed by the charm of that voice that enunciates each syllable so perfectly. O Irreproachable Prince, the king who employs messengers gifted with such talent is certain to succeed in all his undertakings, since they are enhanced at the very outset, by such eloquence.\u201d", "On this, Saumitri addressed that eloquent minister of Sugriva\u2019s in well-chosen words, saying:\u2014\u2022\u201cO Sage, we have been told of the great attributes of Sugriva and are at this moment looking for that King of the Monkeys. That which he commands we will carry out on thine instructions, O Excellent Hanuman.\u201d", "When he heard this gracious speech, that monkey, born of Pavana, who wished nothing more than that Sugriva should triumph, resolved to bring about a friendly alliance between Rama and his master.", "Listening to Lakshmana\u2019s courteous words and marking the feeling of goodwill towards his master, Hanuman, deeming Rama would be willing to assist him, joyfully reflected that Sugriva\u2019s triumph was already assured.", "He thought: \u201cUndoubtedly the magnanimous Sugriva will not fail to regain his kingdom, for here is one who will enable him to accomplish his design.\u201d", "Then the wholly delighted and eloquent Hanuman, the Foremost of Monkeys, said to Rama:\u2014\u201cWhat brings you with your younger brother to this perilous and inaccessible forest?\u201d", "On this enquiry, Lakshmana, prompted by his brother, related the history of Rama, the son of Dasaratha, to him.", "\u201cThere was a king named Dasaratha, who was illustrious, fixed in his duty and, according to the law, the protector of the four castes. Without a foe, he himself hating none, he appeared to all living beings to be a second Brahma.", "\u201cThe firstborn son of Dasaratha, who possessed every excellent quality, the refuge of all, endowed with royal virtues and of great majesty, was banished from his dominion and obedient to the behests of his sire, has come to dwell in the forest. Submitting to the paternal decree, he was followed by his consort, Sita, as the glorious sun by the sunset glow at evening.", "\u201cMy name is Lakshmana. I, who am inferior to him in every respect, am his brother and accompany him as his servant. This dutiful prince, who is ever mindful of what should be done, is extremely learned and this hero, who spends his life in promoting the welfare of all beings, who is worthy of happiness and honour, deprived of supreme power, passes his days in the forest. A titan, who was able to change his form at will, carried off his consort, she being alone, and her abductor is unknown to us.", "\u201cThe son of Diti, Danu, who, through a curse, had been forced to assume the form of a titan, imparted the name of Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, to us. Now I have answered thine enquiries fully in all sincerity; Rama and I both seek the help of Sugriva. The distributor of all wealth, he, who has reached the peak of glory and was formerly the guardian of the worlds, has come to seek Sugriva\u2019s protection. The son of that instructor of his people, who was devoted to his duty, of whom Sita was the daughter-in-law, Rama, seeks the protection of Sugriva. The strong defender of the whole universe, that was formerly his highway, my Guru Rama, whom you seest here, has come to seek refuge with Sugriva. He, under whose compassion all beings rest, Rama, has come to appeal to the goodwill of that King of the Monkeys. It is the eldest son of King Dasaratha, who was endowed with every good attribute and on this earth constantly showered honours on monarchs, Rama, renowned in the Three Worlds, who now seeks refuge in Sugriva, Lord of the Monkeys. Rama, a victim to grief, overwhelmed with affliction, has come as a suppliant! It is for Sugriva with the leaders of the monkey tribes to show favour to him.\u201d", "Hearing Lakshmana, uttering this appeal, his tears flowing the while, Hanuman graciously replied:\u2014", "\u201cSuch suppliants, endowed with wisdom, who have mastered their anger and other passions and whose fortune has led them to his presence, are worthy to be brought before that Indra of Monkeys. He too is exiled from his kingdom and the object of his brother\u2019s enmity, who has carried off his consort and, after maltreating him cruelly, forced him to flee trembling to the forest. That offspring of Surya, Sugriva, will form a pact of friendship with you, and I shall accompany him in his search for Sita.\u201d", "Having spoken thus in a gentle and kindly tone, Hanuman said to Raghava in friendly accents:\u2014\u201cLet us seek out Sugriva.\u201d", "At these words, the righteous Lakshmana bowed courteously to him and addressed the virtuous Raghava, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat this monkey, born of the Wind-God, has gladly told us, his master will carry out; it is here that your purpose will find fulfilment, O Rama. Goodness is painted on his countenance; he speaks cheerfully and his words ring true.\u201d", "Then that extremely intelligent son of Maruta, Hanuman, went away, taking the two heroes, the descendants of Raghu, with him. Abandoning the guise of a mendicant and assuming the form of a monkey, that great ape, taking those two warriors on his shoulders, departed.", "Thereafter, that intelligent son of Pavana, who was renowned among the monkeys and endowed with great prowess, delighted to have accomplished his design, scaled the mountain with immense bounds taking Rama and Lakshmana with him.", "From the Rishyamuka mountain, Hanuman bounded to the Mt. Malaya and presenting the two valiant descendants of Raghu to Sugriva, said:\u2014", "\u201cThis is Rama, O Great and Wise King, who has come here with Lakshmana, his brother; this true hero, born in the dynasty of Ikshvaku, is the son of King Dasaratha.", "\u201cFixed in his duty, he is carrying out the behests of his sire, that great king who, gratifying the Deity of Fire, Agni, with the Rajasuya and Ashvamedha sacrifices, at those times distributed hundreds and thousands of cows in charity.", "\u201cOn account of a woman, his son, Rama, who is present here, was exiled to the forest and, while that magnanimous hero was dwelling there, practising asceticism, Ravana carried off his consort; he now seeks your protection.", "\u201cThese two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, solicit your friendship; do you receive these heroes, worthy of homage, with honour!\u201d", "Hearing these words of Hanuman, Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, who had now become easy of access, said to Rama:\u2014", "\u201cThis is a great fortune and the greatest of gains for me O Lord, that you desirest to ally thyself in friendship with me, who am one of the Monkey Tribe. Should that friendship find favour with you, then here is my hand, take it into thine and let us bind ourselves fast with a vow.\u201d", "Hearing Sugriva\u2019s sweet words, Rama with a joyful heart clasped his hand and, happy in the thought of the alliance they were about to conclude, embraced him warmly.", "Then Hanuman, the Subduer of his Foes, who had put off his monk\u2019s guise, assuming his own shape, kindled a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together. The fire being lit and flowers cast into it, thus preparing it, he placed it between them, full of joy and devotion.", "Going round it they both worshipped the fire and thus Sugriva and Rama were united in friendship. Whereupon the hearts of the monkey and Rama were merry and, gazing upon each other, they were unable to have their fill.", "\u201cYou are now the friend of my heart in joy and pain! We are one!\u201d Thus spoke Sugriva in his satisfaction, as also Rama, and breaking off a branch from a Sala tree adorned with leaves and covered with flowers, Sugriva laid it down as it were a carpet and with Rama sat down upon it, whilst the delighted Hanuman, born of Maruta, in his turn, offered Lakshmana a branch of blossoming sandalwood.", "Thereafter, full of happiness, Sugriva, his eyes wide with delight, said to Rama in sweet and gentle tones:\u2014", "\u201cCruelly persecuted, O Rama, I came hither in great fear, my consort having been wrested from me, and, in deep distress, I took refuge in this inaccessible part of the forest, where I now dwell, my mind distracted with terror.", "\u201cMy brother oppresses me and is mine enemy, O Rama, O Great Hero; do you deliver me from the fear which Bali inspires in me I Act, O Kakutstha, in such a way that my courage may be restored.\u201d", "At these words, the illustrious and virtuous Rama, a lover of justice, smiling, answered Sugriva, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI know well that the fruit of friendship is mutual aid, O Great Monkey! I shall slay that Bali, who has carried off your consort! These pointed shafts that you perceivest, these arrows bright as the sun, fly straight to their target. Decorated with heron\u2019s feathers and resembling Indra\u2019s thunderbolt, skilfully wrought, their points sharpened, resembling provoked serpents, they will pierce that perverse wretch with force. To-day you shalt see Bali fall on the earth like a cleft mountain struck by these pointed darts, resembling venomous snakes.\u201d", "Encouraged by Rama\u2019s words, Sugriva, overjoyed, spoke again, saying:\u2014\u201cMay I by your grace, O Valiant Lion among Men, regain my consort and my kingdom. O King, do you restrain my wicked elder brother from harming me hereafter.\u201d", "At the moment when Sugriva and Rama concluded their alliance, Sita\u2019s left eye, resembling a lotus, twitched, as also did that of the Indra of Monkeys, which resembled gold, and that of the titan, Ravana, which was like a flame.", "In his joy, Sugriva addressed Raghava, the delight of the House of Raghu, once again, saying: \u201cI have learnt thine history from my servant, the best of counsellors, Hanuman, and why you have come to these sylvan solitudes, where you residest with your brother Lakshmana.", "\u201cBorne away by a titan, your consort, Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, is grieving far from you and the sagacious Lakshmana. That titan seeking an opportunity to do you mischief, having slain the vulture, Jatayu, carried off your consort, thus rendering you unhappy. You shalt soon be freed from the sorrow that the abduction of your loved one causes you.", "\u201cWhether she is to be found in heaven or hell, I shall seek out that lady and bring her back to you, O Conqueror of Thine Enemies! Know well, I speak truly, O Raghava. Sita is not destined to be the food of gods or titans; your consort will prove to be a poisoned dish to them!", "\u201cBanish your grief, I will bring your dear one back to you. As I surmised, it was undoubtedly Sita that I saw when that titan of cruel deeds bore her away. She was crying: \u2018O Rama! O Lakshmana!\u2019 in a pitiful voice and struggling in Ravana\u2019s arms, like the female of the Serpent King.", "\u201cSeeing me with my five companions standing on the summit of the mountain, she dropped her cloak and magnificent jewels, which we collected and preserved, O Rama. I will bring them to you and you will perchance be able to call them to remembrance.\u201d", "On this, Rama answered Sugriva in all affection and said:\u2014\u201cGo quickly and bring them to me here without delay, O Friend!\u201d", "At these words, Sugriva, intent on pleasing Rama, ran in all haste to a deep cave in the mountain, and seizing the cloak and jewels, that monkey showed them to Rama, saying:\u2014\u201cThese are they, O Raghava!\u201d", "Then Rama, taking the raiment and the sparkling jewels, found his eyes to be misty with tears, as the moon is veiled in cloud, tears that in his affection for Sita fell in torrents, and, losing his composure, he fell to the earth, sobbing: \u201cO My Dear One!\u201d", "Pressing the precious jewels to his breast, heaving deep sighs like the furious hissing of a snake in its hole, his eyes streaming with tears, perceiving Lakshmana at his side, he began to lament bitterly, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lakshmana, behold Vaidehi\u2019s cloak and jewels, which, while being carried away, she allowed to fall on the earth; without doubt, it was on this grassy slope that Sita, while being borne away, scattered her ornaments, their condition confirms it.\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words, Lakshmana said:\u2014\u201cI do not recognize the bracelets or earrings, but I know the anklets, for I worshipped her feet alone.\u201d", "Then Rama said to Sugriva:\u2014\u201cIn what place didst you behold Vaidehi, my chaste spouse, dearer to me than life itself? What hideous titan bore her away? Where does that monster dwell, who has plunged me in this mourning? Having carried Sita away and kindled my wrath, he has forfeited his life and opened the portals of death. Say, who is this titan, who, in the forest, has by craft borne away my tender consort? O Chief of the Monkeys, to-day I shall dispatch him to the region of death.\u201d", "Thus, in his distress, did Rama speak, and the monkey, Sugriva, with joined palms, weeping, his voice shaken with sobs, answered him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIndeed I do not know where that wicked titan dwells, nor his strength, nor the extent of his valour, nor the tribe to which that vile monster belongs, but, O Subduer of Your Foes, I beg you in all sincerity to master your grief.", "\u201cBy mine efforts, I shall succeed in restoring Maithili to you! By slaying Ravana and his entire house and manifesting my personal courage to the uttermost, I shall act in such a way that you will be happy\u2019ere long. You have yielded to despair sufficiently, now exhibit your native resolution! Men like you should not give way to despondency!", "\u201cI too suffer greatly on account of separation from my consort, but I do not despair like you, nor have I lost courage. Though but a common monkey, I do not indulge in complaint. How much less should you do so, O Magnanimous Hero, you who art wise, valiant and illustrious!", "\u201cYou should resolutely restrain the tears that fall; it becomes you not to lose patience, that quality that distinguishes men of nobility.", "\u201cA brave man has recourse to reason and does not allow himself to be moved either in adversity, consequent on separation from relatives, or on the loss of possessions, or at the time of death. But the man who is lacking in courage and gives way to despair inevitably succumbs to his grief, like an overloaded ship in the water.", "\u201cBowing low before you with joined palms, I beseech you to summon up all your fortitude and not yield to misery. Those who permit themselves to be overcome by grief never succeed, and their strength is decreased; do not therefore give thyself up to sorrow.", "\u201cHe who is overwhelmed by despair is in danger. Banish your sorrow, O Indra among Men, and revive your courage; let it be fully restored! I speak to you for thine own good, as a friend; I do not wish to instruct you. Therefore for our friendship\u2019s sake, do not yield thyself up to grief.\u201d", "Tenderly consoled by Sugriva, Rama wiped his face, which was wet with tears, with the corner of his tunic and, returning to his normal state as a result of Sugriva\u2019s words, the Lord Kakutstha, embracing him, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Sugriva, you dost fulfil the role of a devoted friend, that of being of service with dignity. O Friend, see how, through your good counsel, I have become myself again. It is not easy to find such an ally, who is suffering the same adversity; therefore exert thyself to find Maithili and the cruel titan, that perverse Ravana, and tell me frankly what I should do. You are a rich field that the rains have visited; everything will succeed with you. Further, the words I recently pronounced1 with confidence, O Tiger among Monkeys, will without doubt come to pass. Never have I uttered a falsehood, nor shall I ever do so. I swear by the truth, that what I have said will come to pass!\u201d", "Hearing the words of that King of Men, the wise leader of the valiant monkeys felt in his heart that his purpose was accomplished.", "Gratified on hearing these words, Sugriva joyfully addressed the elder brother of Lakshmana in this wise:\u2014", "\u201cUndoubtedly I am favoured by the Gods, since I have a virtuous friend, full of great qualities, such as you! With your help, O Irreproachable One, it would be possible for me even to conquer the celestial realm, how much more regain my kingdom, O Lord! I am the object of reverence to my friends and kinsmen, O Rama, since, witnessed by the sacred fire, I have formed an alliance with you! O Descendant of the House of Raghu, you will soon find me worthy of your friendship, but it does not become me to speak of mine own good qualities. It is in great heroes such as you, masters of themselves, that affection, like true courage, remains fixed, O Best of Well-born Men! Silver, gold and precious gems are shared amongst friends as belonging to either; rich or poor, happy or wretched, destitute or gifted with good qualities, a friend is ever a friend. Good fortune, prosperity or country, O Irreproachable Hero, are all sacrificed for the sake of a friend; only devotion to him matters.\u201d", "\u201cTrue indeed,\u201d replied the blessed Rama to the handsome Sugriva, in the presence of Lakshmana, who equalled Vasava in wisdom.", "The following day, Sugriva, seeing Rama standing by the valiant Lakshmana, scanned the forest hurriedly and, observing a Sala tree at no great distance, covered with flowers and heavy with luxuriant foliage, in which bees were humming, tore off a magnificent leafy branch, and spreading it on the ground sat down on it with Rama.", "Seeing the two thus installed, Hanuman, in his turn, breaking off a branch of a Sala tree, invited the self-effacing Lakshmana to take his place there.", "Beholding Rama seated at his ease on that lofty mountain, covered with flowering Sala trees, radiating serenity like a peaceful lake, Sugriva, in his delight, in soft and gentle tones, leaning towards his friend who was manifesting extreme joy, said to him in accents trembling with emotion:\u2014", "\u201cHarassed by my brother, my declared enemy, O Rama, fear of Bali preys on my mind. O You who art the refuge of the world, I am without a defender, grant me your support!\u201d", "Hearing these words, the illustrious and virtuous Rama, fixed in his duty, smiling, answered Sugriva, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAdministering relief is the fruit of friendship, harming others that of enmity! This very day, I shall slay the abductor of your consort. Here are my winged shafts and fiery arrows, O Fortunate One, whose hafts, inlaid with gold, resembling Mahendra\u2019s thunder-bolt, have come from the forest of Karttikeya and are adorned with heron\u2019s plumes. Their smooth joints and sharp points lend them the appearance of angry snakes. You shall see that enemy, your brother called Bali, tainted with evil deeds, struck down with these arrows, like a mountain crumbling into dust.\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words, Sugriva, the leader of the monkey army, felt an inexpressible joy. \u201cExcellent 1 Excellent!\u201d, he cried. \u201cO Rama, I have been overwhelmed with distress and you are the refuge of the afflicted. Knowing you to be mine ally, I have poured out my sorrow on your breast. Having clasped your hand in mine, witnessed by the fire, you have become the most valued friend of my life; by the truth I swear it. I have taken you as my friend and speak to you in confidence. The misfortune that has overtaken me constantly gnaws at my heart.\u201d", "Thus spoke Sugriva, his eyes brimming, his voice strangled with sobs, unable to continue. Then, stemming the stream of his tears, that flowed like a raging torrent, Sugriva, in Rama\u2019s presence, mastering himself in an instant and, stifling his sobs, wiped his beautiful eyes. Thereafter, that illustrious monkey once again addressed Raghava, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, formerly Bali, overwhelming me with insults, banished me from the kingdom. Seizing my consort, dearer to me than life itself, he bound my friends in chains. Then that perverse wretch sought to destroy me, O Rama, and often the monkeys themselves were bribed to that end, but I slew them. Full of apprehension on seeing you, O Rama, I did not venture to go out to meet you, being a prey to fear and yet in dread.", "\u201cThese monkeys with Hanuman as their leader are my sole companions; it is due to them that I am still alive, though the situation is grave. These loyal monkeys surround and protect me, accompanying me on all my journeys, remaining with me wherever I decide to stay.", "\u201cO Rama, of what use is it to speak further? My elder brother, Bali, distinguished for his cruelty, is mine adversary. If he dies, at that very moment my misfortunes will be at an end. My happiness, nay, my very life, depends on his destruction. This is the only remedy for my woes. I tell you this while yet overcome with grief; happy or unhappy, a friend is ever the refuge of a friend!\u201d", "At these words, Rama enquired of Sugriva, saying:\u2014\u201cI wish to know the source of this hostility, tell me the cause of your mutual enmity. When the reason for thine hatred is known to me, O Monkey, I will concern myself with your relief. I shall reflect carefully on the matter and on its strength and weakness. Great is mine indignation to learn of thine ill-treatment, my heart beats faster, as in the rainy season the river\u2019s flow is augmented. Speak with serene confidence while I string my bow, and know that when I loose my shaft to strike thine adversary, he is already slain.\u201d", "Hearing the speech of the magnanimous Kakutstha, Sugriva and his counsellors were highly gratified, and with a cheerful countenance Sugriva began to relate the real cause of his enmity with Bali to the elder brother of Lakshmana.", "\u201cBali is the name of my elder brother, the Scourge of his Foes. He was ever held in great esteem by my father and mother, and I, also, loved him. When his father died, he being the elder, the ministers, who thought highly of him, installed him as King of the Monkeys. During his rule over that immense empire of his ancestors, I lived in constant subjection to him, as one of his servants. On account of a woman, a great quarrel arose between Mayavi, the illustrious elder son of Dundubhi and Bali. One night, whilst others slept, Mayavi approached the gates of Kishkindha, roaring with anger and challenged Bali to fight. Roused from deep sleep by those formidable cries, my brother, unable to contain himself, went forth immediately, advancing in fury on that powerful titan in order to kill him. His wives and I tried to restrain him and I threw myself at his feet, but he repelled us all and went forth full of valour.", "\"Then, out of devotion, I followed him. Seeing my brother and me following within a short distance, the titan, in fear, fled in all haste. Struck with terror he ran on, but we ran even faster. The moon, that had risen, flooded the path with its light. Hidden by grass, a large hole in the ground came into view and the titan threw himself into it precipitately. We reached the edge and halted.", "Bali, who was overcome with rage, his senses perturbed, said to me:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Sugriva, remain here, without leaving the mouth of the cave, while I enter in order to engage the enemy and slay him!\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words I besought that Destroyer of his Foes to go no further but he, under the threat of a curse, told me not to move from there and disappeared into the cavern.", "\"After his entry into the cave, a whole year elapsed and I remained at my post without; I imagined him to be dead and in my affection for him was deeply distressed and a prey to fearful presentiments, reflecting: \u2018I shall not see my brother again.\u2019", "\u201cThen, for a long time, blood mixed with foam flowed from the cave and the roaring of the titan reached my ears, but I did not hear the cries of triumph that my elder brother emitted in the struggle. Thereafter on account of the various signs, I went away, thinking that my brother was dead, but first I blocked up the mouth of the cave with a rock as large as a mountain. O My Friend, overcome by sorrow, I offered up the ceremonial water for my brother and returned to Kishkindha.", "\u201cDespite mine efforts to keep the matter secret, the ministers learnt of it and having taken counsel together, they installed me as sovereign. I ruled the empire with justice, O Rama. In the meantime Bali, having slain his enemy, the titan, returned. Seeing me installed with all the insignia of royalty, his eyes became red with anger and he overwhelmed me with reproaches and bound my ministers in chains.", "\u201cHaving slain his adversary, my brother returned to the city, and I, paying obeisance to that great warrior, offered him the traditional homage, but he did not respond to my cordial congratulations. I touched his feet with my forehead, O Lord, but Bali in his anger reiused to pardon me.\u201d", "\u201cIn my desire to make peace, I tried to placate my brother, who, returning, was incensed against me.", "\u201cI said:", "\u2018By the grace of the Gods, you are victorious and thine enemy has fallen under your blows; without you, I should be bereft of support, you are my only defender, O My Protector, My Delight! Now accept this royal canopy of many supports, resembling the full moon about to rise. Take also these chanvaras from my hands!", "\u201c\u2018O King! For a whole year I waited sadly beside the cave and, seeing blood flowing to the entrance and stopping there, my heart was filled with anguish and my mind deeply troubled. I then dosed the opening of the cavern with a great rock and left that place to return to Kishkindha in deep distress. Seeing me, the people of that city and the ministers also placed me on the throne, without my desiring it. Therefore pardon me, you who art our Sovereign. I was invested with royal dignity in thine absence and thus preserved the city, its ministers and inhabitants, from anarchy. This kingdom has been as a trust to me; I now render it back to you, O Friend. Do not be wrath against me, O Destroyer of your Foes! Placing my head at your feet, O King, with joined palms, I appeal to you. It was on the insistence of the ministers and the united populace, that I was placed on the throne, they reflecting that the country would be seized by an enemy in the absence of a monarch.\u2019", "\u201cTo this humble speech, Bali answered with invectives, saying:\u2014\u2018Cursed be you!\u2019 and repeated the imprecation.", "Then, gathering his subjects and ministers together, he inveighed against me, in the midst of my friends, reproaching me with bitter words, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Know well, that in anger the great Titan, Mayavi, one night challenged me to a long-desired combat. Hearing his voice, I left my royal dwelling and was followed immediately by my unscrupulous brother, who is present here. In the night, seeing me followed by another, that great titan fled terrified and both of us pursued him closely. In his haste to escape, he entered a great cave, and, seeing that vast and fearful cavern, I said to my false-hearted brother: \u2018I cannot return to the city till I have slain my rival; do you wait at the mouth of the pit till I have struck him down.\u2019 In the belief that he would remain there, I penetrated into that inaccessible cave.", "\u201c\u2018While I was pursuing mine enemy, whose audacity rendered him truly formidable, a whole year elapsed, but at last I discovered him and slew him with his entire family. That titan, while being slain, roared aloud, and a stream of blood that spread all round, filled the cave, making it difficult to pass. Having happily slain my cruel adversary, I could not find the opening of the cave, the entrance having been closed. I called Sugriva again and again but there was no response and my situation was serious. By dint of kicking, I was able to roll back the rock and emerged, after which I returned to the city. That is why I am incensed against the wicked Sugriva, whose desire for the throne overcame his brotherly affection.\u2019", "\u201cWith these words, the monkey Bali, bereft of all sense of shame, chased me from the kingdom with but a single garment, having ill-treated me and carried off my consort, O Rama. Wretched and deprived of my companions, I took refuge on this lofty mountain, Rishyamuka, to which, for a particular reason, Bah has no access. This is the whole story of the origin of our intense hostility; I have not merited the great humiliation that has visited me, as you now seest, O Raghava. O You who art the dispeller of fear, do you take this dread of my brother from me and punish him in my name.\u201d", "The virtuous prince, having heard the faithful Sugriva\u2019s narrative, smiling, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cThese arrows of mine, bright as the sun, never fail to reach their target and with their sharp points will strike down that evil Bali with force. As long as I do not behold this ravisher of your consort, this wretch of perverse practices will live, but not an instant longer.", "\u201cI see you to be plunged in an ocean of grief, as am I, and I shall aid you to traverse it; you shalt certainly regain thine erstwhile prosperity.\u201d", "Hearing these words, that increased his joy and courage, Sugriva, in extreme delight, uttered the following memorable words.", "Having listened to Rama\u2019s words, which inspired him with joy and courage, Sugriva paid obeisance to him, manifesting his gratitude, and said:\u2014\u201cIn your wrath, undoubtedly, you are able to bum up the worlds with your sharp arrows, like the fire at the end of the great cycle; yet reflect on the courage of Bali and, having heard me with attention, consider what should be done.", "\u201c\u2018Ere the sun rises, the indefatigable Bali strides from the western to the eastern ocean and from the northern to the southern sea. He is so powerful that he is able to break off the lofty mountain peaks, throwing them into the air and catching them again. In order to demonstrate his strength, he will snap in two innumerable trees of every kind in the forest.", "\u201cOnce, there existed a giant, named Dundubhi, in the form of a buffalo, who resembled the peak of Mt. Kailasha and who was as strong as a thousand elephants. The thought of his own might intoxicated him and he was puffed up with pride on account of the boons he had received.", "\u201cThat giant came to the sea, the Lord of Rivers, and approached that ocean of tumultuous waves, rich in pearls, saying:\u2014", "\u2018Let us enter into combat one with the other!\u2019", "But that righteous Lord of the Waters, rising up in all his majesty, answered that titan who was driven on by destiny, saying:\u2014", "\u2018O Skilful Warrior, I am not able to take up your challenge, but hear and I will tell you of one who can match you in fight.", "\u201c\u2018On a vast plain, the retreat of the ascetics, there lives a monarch of the mountains, named Himavat, the far-famed father-in-law of Shiva. He possesses great rivers, many ravines and waterfalls and is well able to satisfy thine overwhelming lust for combat.\u2019", "Reflecting: \u2018The ocean holds me in dread\u2019, that foremost of titans sped to the forest of Himavat, as swift as an arrow loosed from a bow.", "\u201cBreaking off the great white cliffs, Dundubhi let them roll down, shouting with exultation.", "Then, like a mass of white cloud, Himavat of gentle and benign aspect, standing on the summit of the mountain, addressed that titan thus:\u2014", "\u2018Do not torment me, O Dundubhi, O You who delightest in justice! I am not concerned with the exploits of warriors but am a refuge of the ascetics.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words of that righteous monarch of the mountains, Dundubhi, his eyes red with anger, answered:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018If you have not the strength to fight and art paralysed with fear, then tell me who is able to match his prowess with mine, for I wish to enter into combat with him.\u2019", "\u201cHearing this, the wise Himavat, skilful in discourse, answered that powerful titan to whom he had spoken previously, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018The name of that hero of great intelligence, who dwells in Kishkindha, is Bali, the illustrious son of Shakra. That great sage is a skilful warrior and of your stature, he is as well able to enter into combat with you as Vasava with Namuchi. Go with all speed and seek him out, since you are thirsting to fight; he has little patience and is ever full of martial ardour.\u2019", "\u201cHaving listened to the words of Himavat, Dundubhi in fury went to Kishkindha, Bali\u2019s city, and assuming the form of a terrible buffalo with pointed horns, resembling a thundercloud charged with rain in the sky, that powerful titan came to the gates of the capital. Causing the earth to tremble with his cries, he uprooted the trees near the entrance of the city, snapping them in two. Then, like an elephant, he burst open the gates.", "\u201cMy brother, who was in the inner apartments, hearing the tumult, came out, full of impatience, surrounded by his wives, like the moon encircled with stars, and that leader of the monkeys, Bali, said to Dundubhi in clear and measured accents:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Dundubhi, why dost you obstruct the gateway of the city and bellow thus? I know who you are. Have a care for your life, O Warrior!\u2019", "\u201cAt these words of the sagacious King of the Monkeys, Dundubhi, his eyes red with anger, answered:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Do not address me thus in the presence of women, O Warrior! Accept my challenge and meet me in combat to-day, so that I can measure your strength, though, O Monkey, I am willing to restrain my wrath for one night, to allow you to indulge in the pleasures of love, according to your whim, till the rising of the sun. Distribute alms, therefore, to your monkeys and embrace them for the last time. You are the King of the Deer of the Trees, do you load your friends and people with favours. Look long on Kishkindha; enjoy the company of your wives, for I am about to chastise you for thine insolence. To slay a drunken man or one who is demented or whose strength has ebbed away or who is without weapons or defence, or one, like you, given over to lust, is considered equal to infanticide in the world.\u2019", "\u201cDismissing all his wives, including Tara and others, my brother, restraining his wrath, smiling, answered that chief of the titans, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Do not make a pretext of my being inebriated if you are not afraid to enter into combat with me! Know that in the present issue this intoxication is the wine of warriors!\u2019", "\u201cWith these words he threw off the golden chain that his sire, Mahendra, had given him and began to fight. Seizing Dundubhi by the horns, who resembled a mountain, that elephant among monkeys roared aloud and began to assail him with blows. Thereafter Bali with a tremendous shout threw him on the ground and blood began to flow from the stricken buffalo.", "\u201cThen betwixt the two combatants, Bali and Dundubhi, mad with anger, each desirous of overcoming the other, a terrible struggle ensued. My brother fought with matchless courage, equal to Indra\u2019s, dealing blows with his fists, knees, feet and also with rocks and trees. The duel between the monkey and the titan caused the latter to weaken, whilst the strength of the former grew. In the end, Bali, lifting Dundubhi up, let him fall on the earth and in this death struggle the giant perished.", "\u201cAs he fell blood flowed in rivers from the veins of his body and that titan of yast limbs lay stretched on the ground, having rejoined the elements.", "\u201cLifting up the inanimate corpse in his two arms, Bali with one throw sent it flying to a distance of four miles. From the titan\u2019s jaws, shattered by the violence of the fall, blood spouted forth and the drops were carried by the wind to Matanga\u2019s hermitage.", "Seeing that rain of blood, the Sage, displeased, reflected:", "\u2018What perverse wretch has dared to spatter me with blood? Who is this evil, perfidious and vile creature, this madman?\u2019", "\u201cThinking thus, that excellent Muni went out of the hermitage and beheld the buffalo, as large as a mountain, lying dead on the ground.", "By virtue of his austerities, he knew that a monkey was responsible for this deed and he pronounced a terrible curse on that ape who had thrown the corpse there saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018May he never come here! If that monkey who, with a stream of blood, has desecrated this wood where I have built my retreat, ever sets foot in this place, he will die! Should that wicked wretch who has thrown the corpse of this titan here, breaking my trees, come within four miles of my hermitage, he shall assuredly not survive and his confederates, whosoever they may be, who have sought refuge in my forest, will not be permitted to remain here following this malediction. Let them go where they will, for I shall assuredly curse any who stay in these woods, that I have protected like mine own offspring, and destroy the foliage and young shoots, plucking the fruit and scratching up the roots. From to-day, every monkey that I see here will be changed into stone for the period of a thousand years!\u2019", "\u201cOn hearing the words of the ascetic, all the monkeys that frequented those woods went away, and, beholding them issuing from the forest, Bali enquired of them, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Why have you all come here, you dwellers in the Matanga Forest? Happy are they who dwell in the woods!\u2019", "\u201cThen those monkeys told Bali, who wore a chain of gold, the cause of their departure and also of the curse that had been laid on them.", "\u201cMy brother, hearing the monkeys\u2019 words, sought out that great Rishi and with joined palms attempted to appease him, but Matanga refused to listen to him and re-entered his hermitage.", "\u201cTrembling under the shadow of that curse, Bali began to roam about aimlessly, but, terrified of the malediction, that monkey did not dare approach the great mountain Rishyamuka or even glance in that direction, O Prince.", "\u201cKnowing he will never venture here, O Rama, I wander about these woods with my companions, free of all anxiety The heaped bones of Dundubhi, the victim of the arrogance, his strength inspired in him, are here and resemble the peak of a vast mountain. Bali in his might, stripped all the leaves from these seven giant Sala trees with their mighty boughs, one after the other. His strength is immeasurable, O Rama; I have now proved it to you. In consequence, I do not see how you canst overcome him in battle, O King.\u201d", "Thus spoke Sugriva and Lakshmana, smiling, then enquired of him:\u2014", "\u201cWhat can Rama do to convince you that he is able to overcome him?\u201d Sugriva then made answer:\u2014", "\u201cIf Rama is able to penetrate these seven Sala trees, that Bali pierced again and again, with a single arrow, then, by that sign, I shall know he can overcome him. At the same time, let him with a single kick send the carcase of the buffalo flying to a distance of a hundred bows\u2019 length.\u201d", "Having spoken, Sugriva, the corners of whose eyes were slightly red, reflected awhile and then once more addressed Rama, the descendant of Kakutstha, saying:\u2014", "\u201cFull of courage and audacity, renowned for his strength and energy, that powerful monkey has never been defeated in combat. His exploits are famous; the Gods themselves are not able to accomplish them. It was on remembering them, filled with terror, that I resolved to take refuge on the Rishyamuka Mountain. Thinking of that Indra among Monkeys and how invincible, irresistible and ruthless he is, I came here. Filled with distress and anguish, I wander about in these woods with my devoted and excellent companions, Hanuman and others. You are for me a glorious and illustrious friend, O You who art dear to your friends, O Lion among Men! I take refuge with you as in another Himavat; yet I am conversant with the strength of my wicked brother and his overbearing nature and I am not acquainted with your skill as a warrior, O Raghava. Assuredly, it is not that I wish to test you or humiliate you nor inspire you with fear by recounting his great exploits. Mine own cowardice is well known! O Rama, thine accents, thine assurance, your temerity and your stature truly manifest your great power, which is like a fire concealed beneath the ashes.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the magnanimous Sugriva, Rama began to smile and answered him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIf you dost not trust in our courage, O Monkey, I will instil you with that confidence so essential in war.\u201d", "Then with his foot, that mighty hero sent the dried up carcase of that titan flying. Seeing the carcase hurtling through the air, Sugriva once more addressed Rama, who was as radiant as the sun, in the presence of Lakshmana and the monkeys and in candid accents said:\u2014", "\u201cO my Friend, when that corpse was fresh and its flesh intact, it was sent flying through the air by my brother, though he was weakened by inebriation and fatigue. Now stripped of flesh, as light as a straw, you have kicked it in play; it is therefore impossible for me to judge who is the more powerful, you or Bali. Between a fresh corpse and dry bones, there is a great difference, O Raghava.", "\u201cI am therefore still uncertain, My Dear Friend, as to who is the stronger, you or Bali, but if you are able to pierce even a single Sala tree, then I should be able to judge who is superior and who inferior. Therefore stretch that bow, which resembles the trunk of an elephant and drawing the cord up to thine ear, discharge that great arrow, which I am sure will penetrate the Sala tree and by that sign I shall be satisfied. I implore you, O Prince, to do me this great favour. As amongst the planets the sun is greatest and among mountains the Himalayas, just as among quadrupeds the lion is king, so among men you are supreme in valour.\u201d", "Hearing Sugriva\u2019s gracious speech, Rama, in order to inspire him with confidence, took up his bow and a formidable arrow, and taking aim, pierced the Sala trees, filling the firmament with the sound.", "Loosed by that mighty warrior, the arrow, decorated with gold, passed through the seven Sala trees and entering the mountain, buried itself in the earth. In the twinkling of an eye that shaft with the speed of lightning, having pierced the seven trees with extreme velocity, returned to Rama\u2019s quiver.", "Seeing those seven trees pierced by Rama\u2019s impetuous arrow, that Bull among Monkeys was extremely astonished and, overcome with joy adorned with all his ornaments, prostrated himself before Raghava with joined palms, his forehead touching the earth,", "Amazed at Rama\u2019s prowess, he addressed that great warrior, skilled in the scriptural traditions, as also in the use of every weapon, who stood before him and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Lion among Men, with thine arrows, you are able to destroy all the Gods with their King in combat, why not Bali also? O Kakutstha, who can resist you on the field of battle, you, who hast pierced seven Sala trees, the mountain and the earth with a single arrow! Now my anxieties are dispelled and my satisfaction complete. Where could I find a friend such as you, who art equal to Mahendra and Varuna? For my sake do you subdue mine adversary in the form of a brother, I implore you!\u201d", "Rama, embracing the handsome Sugriva, like unto Lakshmana, in his great wisdom answered him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLet us leave here without delay for Kishkindha. Do you precede us. When we come to that city, O Sugriva, it is for you to challenge Bali, who is a brother in name only.\u201d", "Thereafter they started out in all haste for Kishkindha, Bali\u2019s capital. Concealing themselves behind some trees, they halted in a dense wood where Sugriva hurled defiance at Bali with a deep and challenging roar. His clothes tightly wrapped round him, he shouted with all his strength, shattering the silence of the firmament.", "When the powerful Bah heard his brother emitting this tremendous clamour, he was livid with anger and rushed out like the sun rising over the mountain top. Then a terrible struggle ensued between Bali and Sugriva, resembling the clash of Mars and Jupiter, in the heavens.", "With the striking of their palms like the clap of thunder and their fists that were as hard as diamonds, the two brothers, filled with fury, assaulted each other, whilst Rama, bow in hand, watched those two combatants, who resembled the Ashvins.", "Not being able to distinguish between Bali and Sugriva, Rama was loath to loose his death-dealing shaft. Then Sugriva, overcome by Bali, seeing that Rama refrained from coming to his aid, ran towards the Rishyamuka Mountain. Exhausted, his limbs covered with blood, crushed by his brother\u2019s blows, who pressed him furiously, he took refuge in the vast forest. The mighty Bali, seeing him penetrating deep into the woods, said:\u2014", "\u201cGo! I spare you!\u201d he himself not venturing to enter there, through fear of the curse.", "Then Rama, accompanied by his brother and Hanuman, reentering the wood, found the monkey Sugriva. When the latter perceived Rama returning with Lakshmana, he hung his head in shame and in a tearful voice, his eyes fixed on the ground, said:\u2014", "\u201cAfter demonstrating your strength, you didst issue the command: \u2018Challenge thine adversary!\u2019 Thereafter you didst allow him to defeat me. Why hast you done this? O Raghava, you should have told me frankly: \u2018I do not wish to slay Bali,\u2019 then I would not have left this place.\u201d Thus in sad and reproachful tones did the great-souled Sugriva speak, and Rama answered him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Sugriva, My Dear Friend, do not vex thyself but hear the reason why I did not discharge mine arrow. Thine ornaments, clothes, shape and gestures and those of Bali so resembled each other that there was no difference between you! The voice, colour, look, prowess and speech were wholly similar, O Monkey! Disconcerted by thine exact resemblance, O Best of Monkeys, I did not let fly my swift and dreadful death-dealing arrow, the slayer of the foe, for this reason. \u2018One must have a care not to destroy them both,\u2019 I reflected. In truth, had I made an end of thine existence, O Chief of the Monkeys, through ignorance or carelessness, then my stupidity and heedlessness would have been apparent. To kill one\u2019s ally is assuredly a great and heinous sin. Further, I, Lakshmana and the fair-complexioned Sita are all wholly dependent on you; in the forest, you are our refuge. Enter once more into combat, therefore, and fear nothing, O Monkey. In the twinkling of an eye, you shalt see me piercing Bali with my shaft and striking him down; you shalt see him writhing on the field of battle. Do you, however, wear a distinguishing sign, O Chief of the Monkeys, by the help of which I may recognize you in the thick of the struggle. O Lakshmana, these blossoming and beautiful Gajapushpi flowers, do you place round the neck of the magnanimous Sugriva.\u201d", "Plucking the blossoming Gajapushpi from where it grew, Lakshmana placed it round the neck of Sugriva. The creeper that the fortunate Sugriva wore round his neck was as bright as the sun and resembled a circle of cranes illumining a cloud over which they are planing. Sparkling with beauty and encouraged by Rama\u2019s words, Sugriva started on the road to Kishkindha with him.", "The virtuous elder brother of Lakshmana, together with Sugriva, left the Rishyamuka Mountain and proceeded towards Kishkindha, which was maintained by Bali\u2019s valour, Rama bearing his golden bow and carrying his arrows that shone like the sun in his hand.", "Sugriva, his neck adorned with a wreath of flowers, full of courage, strode before the magnanimous Raghava and Lakshmana, behind whom came the hero Hanuman with Nala, the valiant Nila and the illustrious general Tara, renowned among the monkeys.", "They observed the trees bowed with the weight of their flowers and the rivers bearing their peaceful waters to the sea. The ravines and cliffs with their chasms, caves, peaks and charming dales, the lakes with their limpid waters of emerald hue, adorned with opening lotus buds, drew their gaze as they passed. Ducks, cranes, swans, woodcock and other waterfowl were heard calling, whilst in the clearings of the woods deer could be seen grazing on the tender grass and young shoots, without fear of the wild beasts that roamed everywhere.", "Wild and ferocious elephants adorned with ivory tusks, who proved a menace to the lakes by causing the banks to crumble, wandered about here and there and intoxicated with Mada juice, striking their foreheads against the rocks, resembled moving mountains. Monkeys as large as elephants, covered with dust and every species of wild beast and bird were seen by the followers of Sugriva as they passed on their way.", "Advancing thus in all haste, the Joy of the House of Raghu, Rama, seeing a grove of trees, enquired of Sugriva:\u2014\u201cWhat is this clump of trees like a cloud in the sky? Indeed they seem like a mass of clouds ringed round by plantain groves! Great is my curiosity concerning them, O My Friend. I wish to learn of you what these are.\u201d", "On this enquiry from Rama, Sugriva, still walking on, told him the history of that great wood. \u201cO Rama! It is a vast hermitage that removes all weariness and encloses many pleasant gardens and groves; the roots, fruit and water are delicious. Under the name of Saptajanas, seven Munis of rigid vows lived there, lying in the water, their heads alone emerging from it. Every seven days they partook of food, which was the wind from the mountain on which they dwelt. After seven hundred years they ascended to heaven in their bodies. Through the power of their asceticism, this hermitage, encircled by a hedge of trees, is inaccessible even to the Gods and Asuras, as well as their leaders. The birds eschew it, as also the other beasts of the forest; those who enter it unwittingly never return. Lovely melodies are heard issuing therefrom with the music of instruments and singing. Sometimes a divine fragrance is spread abroad from there, O Raghava, and three fires are lit; it is their smoke that one can see from here; the tops of the trees are enveloped in it like a golden cloud, resembling the plumage of a dove.", "\u201cThese trees are magnificent with their tops crowned with smoke, like unto mountains of emerald crowned with rain clouds. Pay obeisance with reverence to them with joined palms, O Valiant Raghava, as also your brother, Lakshmana. Those who offer salutations to those Rishis of pure soul experience naught that is grievous.\u201d", "Then Raghava with his brother Lakshmana, with joined palms, offered salutations to those illustrious ascetics. Having paid reverence to them, the virtuous Rama, his brother Lakshmana and Sugriva with his monkeys went on happily.", "Having left the hermitage of Saptajanas far behind, they beheld the inaccessible Kishkindha protected by Bali. Rama, his younger brother Lakshmana and the monkeys, famed for their valour, seizing their weapons, once more prepared to slay their enemy in that city which the son of the Chief of the Gods protected by his prowess.", "Returning to Kishkindha, Bali\u2019s city, they all concealed themselves behind the trees in the dense forest. Glancing round on every side, the Friend of the Woods, the thicknecked Sugriva began to exhibit signs of extreme anger and, surrounded by his kinsmen, let out a loud roar, challenging his brother to fight. Shattering the firmament with his warcry which resembled a great thundercloud propelled by a high wind, that monkey, who was endowed with a leonine gait and resembled the rising sun, stepped forth.", "Looking at Rama who was skilled in combat, Sugriva said to him:\u2014\u201cBehold Kishkindha, surrounded by its walls made of gold and a rampart of monkeys, that is bristling with instruments of war and from which innumerable banners stream. This is Bali\u2019s citadel. Now fulfil the promise formerly made to me of slaying him, O Hero, as the blessing of Spring visits the creepers.\u201d", "At Sugriva\u2019s words, the virtuous Rama, the destroyer of his foes, answered:\u2014\u201cYou are wearing that which will enable me to distinguish you, this garland of Gaja flowers, placed by Lakshmana round your neck! This creeper worn by you lends you the brilliance of the sky in which the sun is surrounded by stars, O Warrior. To-day, O Monkey, I will deliver you from the fear and hostility that Bali inspires in you. Point out thine adversary in the guise of a brother, O Sugriva! Till Bali is struck down in the forest, let him make merry, for when he crosses my path, he will not return alive. If he should do so, you will be justified in reproaching me for not honouring my word.", "\u201cIn your presence, seven Sala trees were transfixed by me with a single arrow; rest assured that Bali will fall to-day on the field of battle under my shafts.", "\u201cNo light word has ever passed my lips, even in adversity, nor ever shall, even were it to attain my purpose; therefore banish all anxiety.", "\u201cLike a field rendered fertile by the rains of Shatakratu, do you challenge Bali of the golden diadem. O Sugriva, raise a shout that will cause that monkey, proud of his victory, whom you were unable to subdue before, and who is bellicose by nature, to come forth. Those who deem themselves brave are not able to endure the war-cry of their foes, above all in the presence of women.\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words, the golden-hued Sugriva let out a deafening roar, rending the skies.", "Terrified by the clamour, the kine ran hither and thither, like noble women exposed to danger of hostile attack through the negligence of their loved ones, and the wild deer fled away like maddened war horses wounded in battle, whilst the birds fell to the ground like planets whose virtue is exhausted.", "Then that son of Surya emitted a roar resembling thunder, confident of his strength and radiant with courage, like the ocean whose waves are lashed by a tempest.", "His brother Bali, who was seated amidst his wives in the inner apartments, heard the cry of the great-hearted Sugriva and was filled with wrath. When he caught the sound of that uproar, causing terror to all beings, his feelings of lust changed to those of violent anger and, his limbs trembling with fury, he who formerly shone like gold suddenly lost his brilliance, like the sun under eclipse. Grinding his teeth, his eyes flashing with fire, he resembled a lake from which the lotuses have been uprooted. Hearing that unendurable cry, that monkey strode forth in great haste, stamping on the earth as if he wished to shatter it.", "Then Tara, embracing him tenderly, once more avowed her devotion to him and, timid and troubled, addressed him in these words, the wisdom of which the future was to prove:\u2014", "\u201cO Brave Warrior, this anger that has taken hold of you is like a raging torrent; do you abandon it, as on rising in the morning you dost throw aside a faded garland. Tomorrow at dawn, enter into combat with Sugriva, O Valiant Forest Dweller, for you dost not yet know the strength or weakness of thine enemy. That you should set out immediately does not meet with my approval. Hear while I tell you the reason why I seek to delay you!", "\u201cFormerly Sugriva, in great anger, came hither and challenged you to fight, but defeated and overwhelmed by your blows, he fled. Having been assaulted and crushed in this wise, he now returns to challenge you again, which rouses my suspicion. To roar thus in so insolent and arrogant a manner, so filled with wrath, is not done without a particular motive. To my mind, Sugriva has not returned alone but has an escort who is ready to rush to his defence; hence this cry of defiance. Sugriva is a naturally clever and sagacious monkey and will never ally himself to one whose valour has not been tried. This, O Warrior, is what I have heard from the youthful Prince Angada; take heed therefore and have a care; it is to thine advantage! He has told me all that he has heard ftom his emissaries concerning Sugriva while journeying in the forest. Two sons were born to the King of Ayodhya, full of courage, invincible in combat; they are of the House of Ikshvaku and are renowned; their names are Rama and Lakshmana.", "\u201cThese two indomitable heroes have sealed a pact of friendship with Sugriva, and this ally of your brother is Rama, famed for his military exploits, the Destroyer of Enemy Hosts, who resembles the fire at the end of the world cycle. He dwells in the forest and is the supreme refuge of all the virtuous who seek his protection. He is the support of the oppressed, the unique repository of all glory and is conversant with both secular and spiritual learning; his pleasure consists in carrying out the behests of his Sire.", "\u201cAs the King of the Mountains is a treasury of precious metals, so is he a mine of every good quality. It is peace and not war that you should seek with that magnanimous One, the invincible Rama, whose prowess on the battlefield is without limit. O Hero, I have no desire to oppose you, but tell you this for your good. Therefore, heed my counsel! Do not seek a quarrel with your younger brother, O Valiant Monarch. I am certain it is to thine advantage to contract a friendship with Rama. Reconcile thyself with Sugriva and put all thoughts of hatred far from you. Your younger brother is an inhabitant of the forest of amiable qualities. Whether he dwell here or there, he is bound to you from every point of view, and I do not see any like him in the world. With gifts, honours and in other ways, bind him to thyself through kindness. Abandon thine ill-will and let him in future dwell near you. The thick-necked Sugriva is a powerful, valuable and natural ally. Win back your brother\u2019s affection; there is no other way to happiness for you here. If you dost desire to please me and recognizest my devotion to you, then in the name of affection, O My Friend, I implore you to act as I have counselled. Follow my advice which is salutary; trust me and do not give way to anger; live in peace with the son of the King of Koshala; do not quarrel with him, his valour is equal to Indra\u2019s.\u201d", "In these words, which were full of wisdom and would have enabled him to save himself, Tara addressed Bali, but he refused to listen and, driven by the force of destiny, advanced to meet his death.", "Thus spoke Tara, whose face was as radiant as the moon, and Bali answered her in tones of reproach, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhen my brother, who is above all mine adversary, challenges me in anger, how shall I endure it, O Lady of Lovely Countenance? The brave who are not accustomed to bearing insults and who never turn back in battle, O Timid One, would rather suffer death than such ignominy. I may not disregard the weak-necked Sugriva who, in his determination to enter into combat, has offered me so insolent a challenge.", "\u201cHave no anxiety on my behalf regarding Raghava, for he is conversant with dharma and pious by nature. How could he do wrong? Return home with your companions! Why follow me further? You have demonstrated your tender devotion sufficiently! I am about to set out to fight Sugriva; control thine emotions. I shall punish his insolence, but I shall not take his life. I shall enter into combat with him, since he desires it, and, assailed by the blows dealt with my fists and the trunks of trees, he will flee. That coward will not be able to withstand my strength and prowess. O Tara, you have accompanied me far enough and shown thine affection for me sufficiently, now return, and I, having obtained satisfaction from my brother on the battlefield, will follow you; I swear it by my life and race.\u201d", "Then the virtuous Tara, embracing Bali and speaking tenderly to him, weeping, circumambulated him, keeping him on her right hand, and bidding him farewell according to the tradition and reciting the sacred texts so that he might return victorious, she re-entered the inner apartments, distracted with grief.", "When Tara reached the inner sanctuary with the other women, Bali, distraught with anger, went out of the city, hissing like a great serpent. Full of ire, breathing heavily, he ran with all his strength, looking round on every side, eager to find his adversary.", "At last he beheld that powerful monkey, the golden-hued Sugriva, clothed in excellent armour, full of confidence, resembling a brazier, and, seeing him inflated with pride, Bali wrapped his garments more tightly about him, a prey to extreme anger. Having thus girded up his apparel, his fists clenched, full of vigour, he advanced to meet Sugriva and engage him in combat. From his side, Sugriva, also doubling his fists in rage, went out to meet his brother who was wearing a crown of gold.", "Then Bali, addressing Sugriva, whose eyes were red with anger, who was skilled in the art of fighting and was rushing towards him in fury, said:\u2014", "\u201cWith this clenched fist, its fingers tightly closed, I shall deal you a blow that will cause you to yield up your life.\u201d", "At these words, Sugriva, livid with anger, answered:\u2014\u201cIt is mine that will drive the life\u2019s breath out of you by caving in your skull.\u201d Thereafter, violently assaulted by Bali, he hurled himself on him in fury, rivers of blood streaming from him, like a mountain from which torrents fall. Unperturbed, Sugriva, tearing up a Sala tree, struck his rival\u2019s body as lightning fells a mountain peak. Struck by the Sala tree which unnerved him, Bali resembled a heavily-laden ship, sinking with all its cargo in the waves. Endowed with terrific strength and as agile as Suparna, both fought like two formidable giants resembling the sun and moon in the sky. Each of these two destroyers of their foes sought to find the weak point of his enemy.", "Bali excelled in strength and valour while the son of Surya, Sugriva, despite his great energy, was the weaker, and his courage beginning to dwindle, he ceased to boast and, enraged with his brother, made a sign to Rama.", "The uprooted trees with their branches and crests, the blows from fists, knees and feet, fell thick and fast in the formidable struggle that resembled the duel between Vritra and Vasava. Covered with blood, the two monkeys, dwellers in the forest, whilst fighting resembled two thunderclouds clashing together with a great uproar.", "Rama, observing Sugriva, the Prince of Monkeys, exhausted scanning the horizon without ceasing to struggle, and, seeing that he was almost overcome, selected an arrow for the purpose of slaying Bali, and that great hero stretched his bow and with that shaft, resembling a venomous serpent, held it ready, like Antaka, bearing the Wheel of Time. The twanging of the bowstring caused alarm among the birds, who flew away, as also the wild beasts who fled in terror as at the end of the world period.", "Discharged by Rama with a sound like the crash of thunder, that formidable arrow of dazzling aspect pierced Bali\u2019s breast, and under its fatal impact the powerful and valiant King of the Monkeys fell to the earth, resembling Indra\u2019s banner ruthlessly thrown to the ground on the day of the full moon in the month of the constellation of Aries.", "Stricken and senseless, Bali fell, his voice strangled with sobs which gradually died away. Rama, the strongest of men, discharged that formidable, fiery and death-dealing arrow, shining like gold, resembling Time itself at the end of the world, which shot forth like smoke issuing from the flaming mouth of Hara, and, streaming with blood looked like unto a blossoming Ashoka tree on the mountain-side, whereupon the Son of Vasava, like the banner of Indra that has been overthrown, fell senseless on the field of battle.", "Struck by Rama\u2019s arrow, that doughty warrior fell to the earth, like a tree severed by an axe. With his ornaments of fine gold, his limbs paralysed, he sank to the ground, like the banner of the Chief of the Gods, its cord severed.", "At the fall of the King of the Monkeys, the earth grew dark, resembling the firmament bereft of the moon. Though lying on the earth, the body of that high-souled Bah was neither robbed of its beauty nor of its life\u2019s breath, nor did his courage fail him, for that excellent golden necklace that Indra had bestowed on him preserved the life, strength and beauty of that Lord of Monkeys. Adorned with that golden chain, the heroic Monkey Chief appeared like an evening cloud tinged with the roseate hues of dusk! His chain, his body and the arrow piercing his heart blazed in triple glory, even after he had fallen. That arrow loosed by the valiant Rama from his bow, by its virtue opening the way to heaven, brought Bali supreme deliverance.", "Lying on the field of battle, like a fire without flame, he resembled Yayati cast forth from the divine realms, fallen on the earth, his merits exhausted. Like the sun that Time, at the end of the world, throws down on the earth; unapproachable like Mahendra, inaccessible as Upendra, with his golden necklace, his broad chest, his vast arms, his mouth inflamed, his glances wild, that son of a mighty king lay. And Rama followed by Lakshmana, their eyes fixed upon him, approached that warrior lying there like a naked flame about to be quenched. Full of respect for that hero, who was gazing at them, the two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, approached with slow steps.", "On perceiving them, the supremely courageous Bali uttered these harsh words, that seemed both restrained and just. Stretched on the earth, almost without lustre, mortally wounded, motionless, in words pregnant with meaning he addressed that warrior proudly, saying:\u2014", "\u201cStriking me from behind, what merit dost you hope to earn by this, O You who hast inflicted a mortal wound on me, while I was engaged in combat with another?\u2019 The virtuous Rama is full of nobility, generosity and valour; he is compassionate, devoted to the welfare of all beings, fixed in his duty; gracious, omnipotent and conversant with the rules of conduct and austerity; these are the praises sung of you, these are the merits attributed to you by the whole world!", "\u201cSelf-mastery, forbearance, loyalty, fixity of purpose, goodwill and heroism are the virtues of kings, O Prince, as also the repression of evil deeds. It was reflecting on these virtues, believing them to be thine, that I came to fight Sugriva. \u2018Whilst I am filled with rage and engaged in combat with another, he will not attack me\u2019 was my conviction, even without knowing you. Now I perceive that you are a perverse creature, feigning piety whilst in truth you are like a well concealed in the grass, without faith and resorting to evil deeds. Outwardly virtuous, wearing the cloak of integrity, you are in reality a scoundrel, like a fire bidden by ashes, nor do I recognize you behind the concealing mask of virtue.", "\u201cSince I have neither laid waste your land, nor your city and have not offered you insult, why hast you destroyed me\u2014I who am guiltless and who have ever fed on fruit and roots, a monkey dwelling in the forest, who never sought to enter into combat with you but who was engaged in fighting another? You are the son of a king and inspired confidence by your benign aspect and, what is more, you wearest the livery of sanctity; who of the warrior caste, conversant with what is good and evil, in the garb of a righteous man, would commit such a wicked deed?", "\u201cYou are born of the House of Raghu and art spoken of as virtuous, how canst you, assuming the guise of an ascetic, wander about thus? Equanimity of soul, liberality, forbearance, justice, loyalty, constancy and courage are the characteristics of a king, O Prince, also the meting out of punishment to the guilty.", "\u201cWe live in the forest, O Rama, and are but wild beasts who feed on roots and fruits, which is natural to us; but you are a man, O Prince! Land, gold and beauty are the causes of discord, but here in the woods, who will envy us fruit and roots? In temporal and spiritual matters, as well as in the dispensing of reward and punishment, a king should be wholly given up to the task of government and not dominated by any desire for pleasure, but you are consumed by your desires; irascible, restless, disregarding the royal code, your bow is your cherished argument 1 You dost not pursue the path of duty nor does thine understanding concern itself with the interests of the people; a slave to lust, you dost permit your senses to rule you, O Chief of Men. In a word, Kakutstha, you have slain me, who never did you any harm 1 How will you answer in the assembly of the virtuous, having committed this reprehensible deed?", "\u201cThe regicide, the brahmanicide, the slayer of the cow, the thief and the one who finds pleasure in the destruction of other beings, the unbeliever and the one who weds before his elder brother, all these enter hell. The informer, the miser, the one who slays his friend or defiles his Guru\u2019s bed, undoubtedly descends to the region of evil-doers!", "\u201cIt is not permitted to the well-born to clothe themselves in my skin, nor may those, such as you, partake of my flesh if they follow the tradition. There are five kinds of animals possessing five nails on each paw that may be enjoyed by the brahmin and the warrior, O Rama. They are the porcupine, the hedgehog, the deer, the hare and the tortoise. O Rama, men of worth will not touch my skin or bones nor eat my flesh.", "\u201cAlas! I disregarded Tara, who, sagacious and prudent, offered me sound counsel, but in my folly, overpowered by fate, I did not heed it. O Kakutstha, like a virtuous woman who has married a man devoid of faith, the earth is without a protector, since you are its protector. How canst you be born of the magnanimous Dasaratha, seeing that you are deceitful, mischievous, evil-hearted and treacherous? Having exceeded the bounds of restraint, broken the law of the virtuous and disregarded the goad of justice, that elephant, Rama, has struck me down. Guilty of such an infamy, condemned by the wise, finding thyself in their presence, what will you say?", "\u201cThat valour that has been so gready vaunted to us who are neutral, I do not see you exercising against evil-doers! If you had fought me openly, O Prince, you wouldst now find thyself in the presence of death, having been slain by me. You didst overcome me by taking me unawares, as a serpent bites a sleeping man, I who was else invincible. You are ruled by evil. In order to gratify Sugriva, you have struck me down.", "\u201cIf you had first confided your purpose to me, I would have brought Sita back to you in a day. Not only this, but I should have placed that wicked ravisher of your spouse, the titan, Ravana, in your power, a chain round his neck, having laid him low in combat. Even if Sita had been cast into the bottom of the sea or hell itself, I should have brought her back to you at your command, as Vishnu recovered the scriptures that had been borne away by Hayagriva.", "\u201cSugriva would have obtained the throne legitimately on my departure to the celestial realm, whereas now he has acquired it wrongfully, since you have overcome me by craft on the field of battle. As death in this world is inevitable, I hold it as naught but how will you justify your conduct towards me?\u201d", "Thus, pierced by an arrow, his features altered, did that magnanimous son of the Monarch of Monkeys speak whilst looking on Rama, who was as radiant as the sun, after which he fell silent.", "Such was the speech, dictated by a sense of duty and his own interests, full of censure and harsh in tone, that Bali, who was mortally wounded, made to Rama. Resembling the sun shorn of its rays or a parched cloud or a fire that has been extinguished, that illustrious King of the Monkeys, endowed with justice and reason, having upbraided Rama with severity, was addressed by him in the following words:\u2014", "\u201cO Bali, why dost you inveigh against me like a child, since you are wholly ignorant of the traditions of duty, profit and social convention? Without consulting thine elders, who are held in respect by the brahmins, in your simian folly you have presumed to address me thus, who am filled with good-will towards you.", "\u201cThis earth belongs to the Ikshvakus, together with its mountains, forests and woods and they have jurisdiction over the wild beasts, birds and men. It is ruled by the virtuous Bharata, who is fixed in his duty and fully conversant with the law, with the proper means to acquisition of wealth and the right pursuit of pleasure and who is ever engaged in repressing evil-doers and recompensing the virtuous. It is the duty of a king to develop the art of government, be established in virtue, be endowed with valour and know how to estimate time and place. We other princes carry out his righteous commands and range the whole earth in our desire to promote the law. When that Lion among Men, Bharata who cherishes equity, rules the entire world, who would dare to commit an injustice? Fixed in our supreme duty, obedient to Bharata\u2019s will, in accord with the law, we put down transgression. You have violated justice and your conduct is condemned by all, lust being thine only mentor, ignoring as you dost the royal path.", "\u201cOne who pursues the path of duty should regard his elder brother, the one who has given him birth and the one who instructs him in wisdom as his three fathers. Righteousness demands that a younger brother, a son and a virtuous disciple should be regarded as one\u2019s own offspring; even for the virtuous, duty is subtle and not easy to grasp, the soul residing in the heart alone knows what is right and wrong.", "\u201cO Heedless Monkey, you are surrounded by irresponsible simian counsellors, who are unable to control themselves, thus it is a case of the blind leading the blind, how canst you learn from them? I am speaking frankly to you; you had no possible right to reproach me in my wrath. Learn now for what reason I struck you down.", "\u201cYou have acted in opposition to the spiritual law. While Sugriva yet lives, you have had marital relations with Ruma, who is your sister-in-law. O Perverse Wretch, in order to satisfy your lust, you have transgressed the law of righteousness and, O Monkey, since you have not respected your brother\u2019s wife, this retribution has followed you. I see no other means of restraining him who acts contrary to the interests of his subjects and does not conform to the social code but by punishment, O King of the Monkeys!", "\u201cBeing a warrior of an illustrious race, I am unable to brook your villainy. The man who makes his daughter, his sister or his sister-in-law an object of lust, is punishable by death; this is the law!", "\u201cThough Bharata is the supreme monarch, we carry out his behests. How canst you who hast broken the law, escape punishment?

In the presence of his ministers, I pledged my word; how can a man like myself fail to meet these obligations?", "\u201cFor all these reasons based on the law, you canst judge for thyself, whether your punishment is merited or no. That it is wholly just, you will be forced to admit and, further, that one is bound to help a friend if one acknowledges one\u2019s duty. You wouldst have done likewise if you had followed the law. Two of the verses of Manu are specially devoted to these rules of conduct and are known to the authorities of the law; I have been faithful to them. \u2018Those men who, having done wrong, submit to the penalty imposed by the king, are washed free from every stain and ascend to heaven like the good and those who do benevolent deeds.

Other monarchs, in their folly, have also done wrong, but have practiced penance; it is by this means that passion is subdued. But enough of recriminations! Your death has been decreed in accordance with the spiritual law, O Lion among Monkeys; we are not acting on personal impulse.", "\u201cListen to a further reason, O Valiant Bull among Monkeys; having grasped its significance, you will no longer be able to reproach me.

In this world, even royal Rishis, versed in their duty, indulge in the chase. This is why, with a single arrow, I struck you down while engaged in combat with your brother, O Monkey. What boots it, whether you didst enter into combat with me or no, since you are but a monkey.", "\u201cUnquestionably it is kings who dispense the unwritten law and happiness in life, O Best of Monkeys!

In the serenity of thine understanding, that nothing disturbs, the working out of cause and effect are known to you. O You whose speech accords with justice and who art conversant with duty, rescue me who am fallen and the first of those to transgress the law.\u201d", "In a voice strangled with sobs, Bali, groaning, expressed himself with laboured effort, his eyes fixed on Rama, and resembled an elephant sinking in a morass.", "\u201cI am not concerned for myself or Tara or my relatives, as much as for my virtuous son, Angada, of golden bracelets.

Let the warriors save the city and install Angada as king 1 The monkeys will obey Bali\u2019s son, who will take his place. If these conditions do not meet with thine approval, O Lady of agreeable looks, then the monkeys will seek other inaccessible retreats. Amongst those who live in the forest, some have no wives, others have common wives, but we fear those who have been deprived of their wives and still desire them.\u201d", "As they were but a short distance away, that Lady of Sweet Smiles heard them and answered with dignity, saying:\u2014", "\u201cSince that Lion among Monkeys is dying, of what use to me is my son or the entire kingdom?

Do not ally thyself with those who are not his friends, still less his foes, O Conqueror of Thine Enemies! Be loyal to Sugriva, your master, with your senses fully controlled and ever be attentive to his interests. Be not inordinately attached to any nor hold any in contempt; both extremes are a great error, therefore pursue the middle course.\u201d With these words, suffering intensely from the arrow, his eyes staring wildly, his great teeth chattering, Bali expired.", "Then a great tumult arose among the monkeys, thus deprived of their leader, and all the forest dwellers gave vent to lamentations, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHenceforth Kishkindha is nought but a desert, the King of Monkeys having ascended to heaven; his gardens are but a wilderness, as are the mountains and the woods. That Lion of Monkeys has passed away; the forest-dwellers are stripped of their glory.", "\u201cHe engaged the illustrious and long-armed Golaba, the Gandharva, in a terrible battle lasting ten years and yet another five; that struggle did not cease day or night; then in the sixteenth year, Golaba was struck down, that foolhardy one falling under the blows of Bali of strong teeth. How has he who protected us from all peril fallen in his turn?", "\u201cThat valiant Leader of Monkeys being slain, the forestdwellers will not be able to find any safe place of refuge, like kine in the midst of a lion-infested forest.\u201d", "On hearing these words, Tara, who was submerged in an ocean of grief, gazing on the face of her dead lord, fell to the earth, embracing Bali like a creeper clinging to an uprooted tree.", "Thereupon, smelling the face of that King of the Monkeys, Tara, who was renowned throughout the whole world, addressed her dead consort, saying:\u2014", "\u201cNot having followed my counsel, O Warrior, you are now stretched on the rough, hard and stony ground. Hast you then chosen the earth as your love rather than myself, since you now liest embracing it, whereas to me you dost not utter a single word?", "\u201cAlas! Fate has favoured Sugriva, that valiant One, whose noble exploits will now cause him to be regarded as a hero. The Leaders of the Bears and Monkeys pay homage to your prowess! Hearing their cries of distress and those of the unfortunate Angada and myself, why dost you not wake? Having been slain in combat, you sleepest on that hard bed, the place where formerly thine enemies rested struck down by your blows. O My Beloved, you are the offshoot of a glorious race renowned for its heroism; you, for whom war was but a sport, art gone, leaving me alone without a protector, O Proud Monarch 1 Nay, a wise man should never give his daughter in marriage to a warrior. Mark how I, wedded to a Kshatriya, am about to die, having been made a widow. My pride is humbled, and from this moment the path to everlasting life is closed to me. I am submerged in an ocean of grief without ground or bourne! How hard is my heart that, even seeing my dead lord, it does not break into a thousand fragments\u2014my friend, my lord, naturally dear to me, that hero, who, falling on the field of honour under the blows of a warrior more powerful than he, has returned to the five elements. The woman who loses her consort, even if she have sons and be endowed with wealth, is yet a widow, say the wise. O Hero! You are lying enveloped in the blood that flows from your limbs, as you were formerly with the scarlet silk of your couch. Dust and gore covers your body on every side, so that I cannot hold you in mine arms, O Bull amongst Plavagas.", "\u201cTo-day, Sugriva has achieved the purpose for which he engaged you in this formidable struggle. A single arrow discharged by Rama freed him from all fear. That shaft that pierced thine heart now prevents me from embracing your body and I can but gaze on you, who art rejoining the five elements.\u201d", "At that moment the General Nala drew out from the corpse the arrow which resembled an angry snake issuing from a mountain cave and glittered as he withdrew it, like the sun whose rays have been intercepted by the peak of a mountain. Thereupon streams of blood instantly began to flow again from those wounds on every side, resembling the water of a river that is stained by the sandstone washed down from a mountain.", "Tara, wiping off the dust of combat with which he was soiled, washed her brave lord with the tears that welled up in her eyes, while she gazed lovingly down on him lying there, pierced by Rama\u2019s arrow, his limbs all covered with blood. Then, addressing her son Angada, whose eyes were red, she said to him:\u2014", "\u201cBehold the bitter end of your sire, O My Son! How tragic it is! This is the outcome of an hostility born of perfidy! This body, gleaming like the sun about to rise, has entered the region of death. Embrace that proud monarch, O My Son!\u201d", "At these words, Angada rising, seized hold of the feet of his father with his rounded arms, saying:\u2014\u201cIt is I, Angada! When I embraced you formerly you didst say \u2018Live long, O My Son\u2019, why dost you not speak to me thus now?\u201d", "Then Tara said:\u2014\u201cHere I stand beside thine inanimate body, like a cow with its calf beside a bull that a lion has just slain! I do not see the gift that the King of the Gods bestowed on you when gratified by his victory over the Asura, that glorious chain of gold, why is this? You shall not be robbed of the insignia of royalty even after death, O Proud Monarch, for the King of the Mountains continues to glow after the sun has set.", "\u201cYou didst not follow my sage counsel and I was unable to restrain you. Your death on the battlefield has brought about mine own and my son\u2019s also. The Goddess of Prosperity has renounced both you and me.\u201d", "Seeing Tara submerged in the fathomless ocean of grief, Bali\u2019s younger brother was filled with remorse for his tragic end and overcome with distress, his face bathed in tears, in her presence, slowly approached Rama surrounded by his attendants.", "Raghava, bearing all the marks of royalty, stood apart, full of dignity and majesty, bearing his bow and arrows, which resembled serpents, in his hands.", "Then Sugriva addressed him, saying:\u2014\u201cIn accord with your promise, O Indra among Men, you didst accomplish this deed, the results of which are here made manifest. In the midst of my triumph, O Prince, in the presence of the slain, my spirit is troubled. On account of the dead monarch, his chief queen is wailing piteously, the city is giving vent to lamentation and Angada is plunged in affliction; all this, O Rama, robs sovereignty of any delight for me.", "\u201cAt first, anger, resentment and extreme vexation caused me to view the death of my brother with satisfaction, but soon, in the presence of the corpse of that King of the Monkeys, a great sadness seized me, O First of the House of Ikshvaku. Now it is made clear to me that it would have been better to continue to live as I formerly did on the lofty summit of the Rishyamuka mountain, than slay my brother.", "\u201c\u2018I have no desire to destroy you! Begone !\u2019 were the words that magnanimous warrior addressed to me. This utterance was worthy of him, O Rama, and I, by killing him, have acted vilely. How can any, even if he be devoid of virtue, approve the murder of a brother or balance the happiness experienced on attaining a kingdom with the grief suffered by his death. Unquestioningly he had no intention of slaying me, being too great of soul, but in my perversity I have robbed him of his life.", "\u201cIn the struggle, when, under the blows of the trees, I was about to succumb and cried out, he at once reassured me, saying:", "\u2018Do not repeat thine impudence; go hence!\u2019", "\u201cHe was ever filled with brotherly affection, nobility and justice, whereas I was full of anger, envy and the natural characteristics of a monkey.", "\u201cThat which should be excluded from one\u2019s thoughts, feelings, desires and conduct is what I have harboured in murdering my brother, a crime equal to the slaying of Vish-warupa by Indra. But Indra\u2019s guilt was shared by the earth, the trees and the waters as well as women, whereas who is able to share mine? Who would wish to bear the weight of the sin of a Deer of the Trees?", "\u201cI am not worthy to be held in honour by the people, nor to be allied to the kingdom, still less do I merit the throne, having committed such an infamous deed that entails the destruction of one of mine own race.", "\u201cI have perpetrated a vile and ignoble act, condemned by the whole world. An overwhelming sorrow fills me, as torrential rain fills a ravine. I am crushed by the bank of a river that has been trodden down by an intoxicated elephant, whose back and tail are the murder of my blood-brother, whose trunk, eyes, head and tusks are the remorse bearing me away.", "\u201cThis sin, the weight of which is intolerable, O Prince, O Son of the House of Raghu, has destroyed all that is best in my heart, as fire consumes gold, leaving only dross. The company of the great leaders of monkeys, O Prince, are half dead through my fault and also on account of the violent despair of Angada.", "\u201cRare indeed is a son as obedient as Angada, but a son is easily acquired; where however in the world can one akin to a blood brother be found, O Hero? To-day, if Angada, that Chief of Warriors, and his mother live, she, though overcome with grief will surely care for him, for bereft of him she would die. As for me, I wish to enter the blazing pyre in order to regain the affection of my brother and his son.", "\u201cThose leaders of monkeys will set out in search of Sita whenever you commandest. O Son of that Indra among Men, I, the Destroyer of my Race, who am no longer worthy to live after committing this outrage, bid you farewell, O Rama.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the wretched Sugriva, Bali\u2019s brother, that noble descendant of the House of Raghu, Rama, began to weep, he, the Destroyer of Hostile Armies, for his mind was troubled. Thereafter, glancing here and there, that support of the earth, the protector of the world, Rama, in the midst of his distress, observed Tara groaning under the load of her affliction.", "The chief queen of that Lion among Monkeys, of lovely eyes, was lying beside her lord, whom she held in her arms. Then the first of the ministers raised up that valiant consort of the King of the Monkeys, and she, trembling as they separated her from her lord, whom she was embracing, beheld Rama, whose radiance equalled the sun\u2019s, standing with his bow and arrows in his hand.", "Adorned with all the distinguishing marks of royalty, that large-eyed prince, whom she had never yet beheld, that first of heroes, was recognized by Tara, whose eyes resembled a doe\u2019s, and she reflected \u2018It is Kakutstha!\u2019", "Then that noble and unfortunate lady, who had so suddenly been plunged into affliction, tottering, approached the one who was the equal of Indra, inaccessible and all powerful. The venerable Tara, her beautiful frame wasted with grief, drawing near to the pure-souled Rama, who by his valour ever attained his end in combat, addressed him thus:\u2014", "\u201cYou are of immeasurable courage, unapproachable, master of your senses and of supreme faith; your fame is imperishable, you are full of wisdom and the support of the earth I Thine eyes are the colour of blood; you bearest a bow and arrows in thine hand; you are endowed with great strength and strong limbs; you have renounced the concerns of the body in this world in order to enjoy divine attributes. The shaft with which you didst pierce my beloved lord, now use to destroy me also. When I am dead, I shall be reunited to him; without me, Bali will never be happy, O Hero. Far from me, even in heaven, amidst the red-haired Apsaras, whose locks are braided in various ways and who are gorgeously attired, he will not be happy, O You whose eyes resemble the pure petals of the lotus.", "\u201cYou knowest well that he who is separated from his loved one is wretched! On account of this, slay me, so that Bah shall not suffer in mine absence. If, in the greatness of your soul, you should reflect \u2018I will not be guilty of slaying a woman\u2019, say to thyself, \u2019she is part of Bali himself\u2019 and strike me down. It will not be a woman whom you have put to death, O Son of that Indra among Men! By virtue of the law and according to the different Vedic texts, women are not other than the higher self of man. Therefore the wise say that the gift of a woman is assuredly the greatest of gifts. In this wise you dost give me back to my dear one in order that I may fulfil my duty to him, O Warrior; by this offering you shalt not incur the sin of slaying me.", "\u201cFilled with sorrow, bereft of support, left desolate, you shouldn\u2019st not spare my life. The more so that far from that sagacious Prince of Monkeys, whose joyful gait resembled an elephant\u2019s, with his glorious golden chain, the insigna of supreme majesty, I shall not live long, O Prince.\u201d", "Thus spoke Tara, and in order to console her, the magnanimous Lord addressed her with wisdom and understanding, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Consort of a Hero, do not grieve! The whole universe is ordered by the creator; similarly it is established that the sum of good and evil is ordained by Him, nor do the Three Worlds, obedient to His will, transgress His fixed laws. Because of this, you will attain supreme happiness and your son become heir-apparent to the kingdom. The Lord has ordained this in the order of things; the consorts of heroes do not complain.\u201d", "Thus comforted by the magnanimous and powerful victor of his foes, the wife of the valiant Bali, the gorgeously-attired Tara, ceased to lament.", "Full of compassion for Sugriva\u2019s distress and that experienced by Tara and Angada, Kakutstha, who was accompanied by Lakshmana, in order to console them, said:\u2014", "\u201cIt is not by weeping that the happiness of the departed is assured! Carry out your immediate duty without delay! By shedding tears, you have observed the demands of social convention; it is vain to seek to avoid fate. Time1 is the driving force that orders the world\u2019s events; it is Time that creates all conditions here below. None is the real agent of action and none truly causes action to take place. The world abides by virtue of the dictates of its own inner being. Time is its source, stay and goal. Time does not overstep its own bounds, nor does it suffer decrease. Self-dependent, there is neither kinship nor friendship in it, nor is it restrained by any, nor has it any cause. Assuredly, he who sees clearly is aware of the working of Time. Duty, prosperity and pleasure are subject to Time; it is on this account that Bali attained his own true state. The King of the Plavagas has reaped the fruit of his works, acquired by his merits, through his integrity and liberality. He has attained heaven on account of his observance of duty and he has taken possession of it by sacrificing his life. The Sovereign of the Monkeys has reached the highest state. You have mourned long enough; now perform the last rites.\u201d", "When Rama ceased speaking, Lakshmana, the Slayer of His Foes, spoke sagely to Sugriva, who was distraught, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Sugriva, inaugurate the obsequies without delay with the assistance of Tara and Angada. Issue the order that a large quantity of dry wood be gathered together with the sacred sandalwood, for the funeral pyre. Banish indecision; this city depends on you. Let Angada bring garlands and robes of every kind, together with butter, oil, perfumes and all that is requisite.", "\u201cO Tara, do you find a palanquin without delay; prompt action is always praiseworthy, the more so at such an hour. Let those who are skilful and strong, accustomed to palanquins, hold themselves in readiness to bear Bali away.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Sugriva, the on of Sumitra, Lakshmana, the Slayer of His Foes, took up his position beside his brother.", "Hearing Lakshmana\u2019s command, Tara with a beating heart hastened to the cave, bent on finding a litter, and soon returned with one borne by strong monkeys to whom the work was familiar.", "It was indeed magnificent, well-cushioned and resembling a chariot, the sides being marvellously decorated and enriched with carved wooden figures. Resting on wonderful supports, it was gorgeously fitted like a palace belonging to the Siddhas and was furnished with windows and balconies that were spacious and embellished with carvings, a work of extreme artistry. Large and well constructed of wood from the mountain-side, priceless ornaments, strings of pearls and splendid crowns gave it a dazzling appearance and it was covered with clay, painted red and sprinkled with sandal-paste. Festooned with wreaths of lotuses, shining like the dawn, it was strewn with innumerable flowers.", "Beholding it, Rama said to Lakshmana:\u2014\u201cLet Bali\u2019s body be placed upon it with all speed and let the funeral ceremony proceed.\u201d Then Sugriva, weeping, assisted by Angada, raised Bali\u2019s body and placed it on the litter. Having laid the corpse on its couch, he covered it with ornaments of every kind together with wreaths and cloths. Thereafter, Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, commanded that the last rites of his noble brother should be carried out on the banks of a river.", "The great monkey leaders preceded the litter, scattering jewels of every kind in profusion. Every honour due to a king of this world was offered by the Vanaras to their lord that day.", "Then the funeral rites began immediately, Angada, Tara and the others surrounding the master they had lost. On their side, the women who had lived subject to his authority gathered together crying: \u201cO Hero, O Hero\u201d, thus bewailing the death of their lord.", "All the wives of Bali, who had been widowed, with Tara at their head, accompanied their deceased sovereign, lamenting pitifully. Their cries were heard in the depth of the forest and re-echoed through the woods and among the rocks on every side. Then on a deserted sandbank surrounded by water, formed by a torrent issuing from the mountain, innumerable monkeys, inhabitants of the forest, constructed a pyre, and those excellent bearers reverently lowered the litter from their shoulders and all stood round, plunged in mourning.", "Seeing her lord lying on the funeral bed, Tara, taking his head in her lap, a prey to extreme grief, began to lament:\u2014", "\u201cO Illustrious and Mighty Prince, O My Dear One, look on me! Why dost you not cast a single glance on all those who are plunged in sorrow? You smilest even in death, O Noble Hero, and your countenance resembles the rays of the rising sun! Death, in the guise of Rama, has struck you down, O Monkey! A single arrow discharged by him on the field of battle has made us all widows. Your wives, present here, who no longer know how to leap, O Indra among Kings, have come this painful road step by step on foot, is it not known to you? Dost you no longer love these women whose radiant looks resemble the moon? Why dost you not look on Sugriva, O King of the Monkeys? Here are your counsellors, O Sovereign, also Tara and the others and the leading citizens surrounding you, all plunged in grief. Dismiss your ministers as you were wont to do, O Vanquisher of your Foes, and we will go to the woods with you in happy dalliance.\u201d", "Then the women, themselves overwhelmed with affliction, caused Tara to rise.", "Assisted by Sugriva, Angada, sobbing, bore his sire to the funeral pyre, his mind distraught with grief, and, igniting the flames according to the traditional rites, keeping his father on his right hand, he circumambulated him, sorrowfully watching him setting forth on his last journey.", "Having performed the ritual acts in honour of Bali, that Bull among Monkeys, accompanied by Sugriva and Tara, performed his ablutions.", "Associating himself with Sugriva\u2019s loss, the mighty Kakutstha, sharing his grief, officiated at the funeral rites.", "The body of Bali, chief of heroes, full of glory, whom that descendant of Ikshvaku had slain with his marvellous arrow, having been cremated, Sugriva, whose splendour resembled a clear flame, approached Rama and Lakshmana who accompanied him.", "The chief ministers encircled Sugriva, who was clad in dripping garments and overcome with grief. Approaching the illustrious Rama of imperishable exploits, he stood before him with joined palms like the Sages before the Grand-sire of the World.", "Then Hanuman, the son of Maruta, who resembled a mountain of gold, his face shining like the rising sun, addressed him with profound reverence in the following words:\u2014", "\u201cMay it please you, O Kakutstha, to reinstate Sugriva in the vast and impregnable kingdom of his mighty ancestors. Be gracious unto him, O Lord, and permit him to return to his magnificent capital. May he regulate his affairs with the co-operation of his many friends.", "\u201cAfter the purificatory bath of perfumes and aromatic herbs of every kind, he will pay you homage and bestow gifts and garlands and precious gems, scents and herbs on you. You should enter this marvellous cave, carved out of the mountain, and unite these monkeys with a master, thus making them happy!\u201d", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s words, Rama, that Destroyer of Hostile Warriors, answered him with wisdom and eloquence, saying:\u2014", "\u201cMost beloved Hanuman, in accordance with the behests of my sire I may not enter a village or city for fourteen years. Let Sugriva, that Bull among Monkeys enter that prosperous and glorious city and be installed as king according to the traditional rites!\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Hanuman, Rama said to Sugriva:\u2014\u201cYou who art conversant with your duty, proclaim that noble and valiant hero, Angada, heir-apparent to the kingdom. He is the eldest son of your elder brother and equal to him in courage; Angada has a valiant heart and deserves to be thine heir. It is now Shravana, the first month of the rainy season, that brings the floods; it is no time for military exploits therefore return to your capital. As for me, I shall live on the mountain with Lakshmana. This cavern, carved out of the rock, is large and airy and possesses a lake whose crystalline waters abound in lotuses of every kind. When the month of Kartika has come, make ready to slay Ravana, this is our pact; meantime, O Friend, return to thine home and receive the royal anointing, thus gratifying your friends.\u201d", "Thus dismissed by Rama, Sugriva, that Bull among Monkeys penetrated into the enchanting city of Kishkindha of which Bali had been the supreme lord.", "Following their sovereign, thousands of monkeys prostrated themselves, touching the dust with their foreheads, and Sugriva, full of valour, called on them to rise, addressing his subjects with affection.", "That mighty warrior thereafter entered his brother\u2019s private apartments and, having come there, the powerful hero, Sugriva, that Bull of Forest-dwellers, was proclaimed king by his friends, as was formerly the God of a Thousand Eyes.", "Then they brought him a white canopy, decorated with gold, and two magnificent whisks of yak\u2019s tails with gleaming golden handles, also gems of every kind and grain and grass, together with blossoming branches, flowers and rich stuffs, white unguents, fragrant garlands, wild flowers and those that grow in water, sacred sandalwood, varied and numerous perfumes, roasted grain, gold, panic seed, honey, butter, curds, a tiger skin and wonderfully wrought sandals.", "Thereafter six lovely young girls, bringing scents, tallow and red and yellow pigments, entered joyfully and distributed gems, raiment and food among the foremost of the twice-born.", "Those versed in the sacred formulas then prepared heaps of kusha grass and, igniting a fire, poured out the Soma, purified by the recitation of traditional prayers. Then Sugriva, seated on a gorgeous golden-based throne, covered with rich draperies and a magnificent three-tiered baldaquin, decorated with marvellous garlands, facing the East, was enthroned.", "Those Lions among the Forest-dwellers had visited the banks of rivers and streams, far and wide, as well as the sacred places and the seas, in order to draw pure water which they brought back in pitchers of gold.", "Employing golden vases and the polished horns of bulls, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Mainda, Dvivida, Hanuman and Jambavan in accordance with the tradition laid down in the scriptures and on the instructions of the Sages, poured the clear and fragrant water over Sugriva, as formerly the Vasus bathed Vasava of a Thousand Eyes.", "When the enthronement was completed, all those illustrious leaders of the monkeys raised a shout of joy again and again. Thereafter, in order to follow Rama\u2019s counsel, Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, embracing Angada, installed him as heir-apparent.", "Angada received the investiture, and those magnanimous Plavagas acclaimed him crying \u201cExcellent! Excellent!\u201d, praising Sugriva and the great-souled Rama and Lakshmana. All were overjoyed on this auspicious occasion; a large and merry crowd, fully satisfied, filled the streets, carrying banners and standards in the enchanting city of Kishkindha, which had been hollowed out of the mountain.", "Having informed the illustrious Rama of the great coronation ceremony and being reunited with his consort, Ruma, the heroic leader of the monkey army took possession of his kingdom, like the Chief of the Immortals.", "The monkey Sugriva, having been crowned king, returned to Kishkindha, whilst Rama retired to the Mountain Prasravana.", "That mountain resounded with the cries of tigers and deer, and the roaring of the lions that frequented it was heard day and night; bushes, diverse creepers and innumerable trees were to be seen everywhere. It was inhabited by bears, lynxes and many kinds of monkeys and resembled a mass of clouds sparkling with light and beauty. On the summit was a large and spacious cave, which Rama, who was accompanied by Saumitri, chose as a dwelling for himself.", "Having contracted an alliance with Sugriva, Rama, the irreproachable descendant of the House of Raghu, addressed his brother Lakshmana, the increaser of his delight, in appropriate and significant words, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Saumitri, Destroyer of Your Foes! We should establish ourselves in this agreeable rocky cavern during the rainy season. This peak, the most lofty on this mountain, is enchanting, O Prince! White, black and dun-coloured crags adorn it and metals of every kind abound, while its rivers swarm with frogs; it is filled with innumerable trees and charming creepers, where a variety of birds warble and splendid peacocks can be heard; Malati, Kunda, Sinduvara, Shirishaka, Kadamba, Arjuna and Sarja trees embellish it with their blossom.", "\u201cHere is a lovely pool, festooned with flowering lotus, adjoining the cave, O Prince. Where the rock is hollowed out, it inclines to the north east, which will make our stay more agreeable, whilst on the west it is higher and we shall be sheltered from the winds. At the entrance, O Saumitri, is a smooth black stone like a piece of antimony washed in oil; to the north, O Friend, the crest of the mountain is magnificent and looks like a mass of polished collyrium or a stationary cloud. To the south, it stretches like a white veil, resembling Mount Kailasha, rich in metals, which give it a dazzling appearance.", "\u201cObserve this river of translucent water like unto Jahnavi on the Mount Trikuta! Candana, Tilaka, Sala, Tamala, Atimuktaka, Padmaka, Sarala and Ashoka trees embellish it; Vanira, Timida, Bakula, Ketaka, Hintala, Tinisha, Nipa, Vetasa and Kritamalaka trees grow on its banks, adorning it on every side, like a woman attired in rich raiment and precious gems.", "\u201cInnumerable flocks of birds fill it with their various notes and waterfowl enliven it with their amorous frolics. The river has created enchanting islands which are frequented by swans and cranes; its smiling aspect calls to mind a beautiful woman wearing innumerable ornaments. Here it is carpeted with blue lotuses, there shining with the red and in the distance white water-lilies may be seen. Ducks sport here in their hundreds, whilst peacocks and curlews fill this river, full of charm and colour, with their cries, and groups of sages frequent it.", "\u201cSee how the Sandal and Kadubha trees grow in clusters of five, as if planned by an intelligent will. Ah! What an enchanting spot! O Saumitri, You Scourger of Your Foes, let us enjoy it to the full and make our retreat a happy one. Kishkindha too is not far from here, that marvellous city of Sugriva\u2019s, where songs and the sound of musical instruments are heard, O Most Illustrious of Conquerors! It is the monkey warriors sporting to the sound of drums.", "\u201cHaving recovered his consort and his kingdom, that monarch of the monkeys, Sugriva, surrounded by his companions, is assuredly celebrating his return to full prosperity.\u201d", "With these words, Rama with Lakshmana took up their abode on the Mountain Prasravana, where there were innumerable caves and woods.", "Yet despite the beauty and abundance of fruits, Rama was unable to find the least pleasure there. Remembering the woman who had been torn from him and who was as dear to him as his very life\u2019s breath, the more now, when the moon was rising over the summit of the mountain, he was unable to sleep, passing the nights on the couch, sighing, his spirit troubled, a prey to constant grief.", "Seeing Rama desolate and a victim to profound melancholy, Lakshmana, who was equally afflicted, addressed him in affectionate words, saying:\u2014\u201cCease to mourn, O Hero, you should not distress thyself thus. One who grieves is never successful, you knowest it well. In this world, one should have faith and trust in God, pursue virtue and engage in action, O Raghava! If your mind is agitated, you will never be able to overcome that titan, thine adversary, in combat, for he is a crafty fighter.", "\u201cBanish your grief and persist in thine endeavour; it will be thine to triumph over this demon and his entire family. O Rama, you canst overthrow the earth with its oceans, forests and mountains, how much more Ravana! Wait but till the autumn, for it is now the rainy season, then you shalt destroy him, his kingdom and his kinsfolk. Truly I desire to rekindle your dormant valour, as at the hour of sacrifice the fire buried beneath the ashes is revived by glowing libations.\u201d", "This salutary and opportune counsel of Lakshmana\u2019s was received by Rama with respect and he answered in tender and friendly accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lakshmana, inspired by devotion, you have spoken to me with wisdom and courage. Henceforth I shall manifest that valour no danger is able to subdue. I shall wait for the autumn and in accord with your counsel depend on Sugriva\u2019s willing co-operation and the state of the rivers. He who has rendered a service merits repayment; the ungrateful who do not honour an obligation lose the respect of the good.\u201d With joined palms, Lakshmana listened with approval to this judicious speech and addressed Rama, who had regained his cheerful mien, saying: \u201cYou speakest truly, O Chief of Men; without fail, that monkey will bring about that which you desirest. Meantime, while awaiting the autumn, endure the rains, resolving to slay thine adversary. Restraining thine anger, let us pass these four months of autumn together, dwelling on the mountain frequented by lions, and then hold thyself in readiness to destroy thine enemy.\u201d", "Having slain Bali and enthroned Sugriva, Rama, who was dwelling on the Malyavat plateau, said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cNow the rainy season is here, see how the heavens are laden with clouds as large as hills. After nine months, the sky, by the action of the sun\u2019s rays, has sucked up the waters of the ocean and is now giving birth to the showers.", "\u201cAscending to heaven by the stairway of the clouds, one might decorate the sun with garlands of Kutaja and Arjuna blossom. The sky appears like one wounded, bound with the rags of moisture-laden clouds, stained with the vivid tints of the setting sun, bordered with red. With the gentle breeze as its breath, the saffron colour lent by the twilight and its yellow clouds, the sky seems like one who is sick with love. Tormented by the sun\u2019s rays, the earth is shedding tears, like Sita racked by grief. Emerging from the heart of the clouds, cool as camphor, redolent with the fragrance of Ketaka flowers, the balmy winds can, as it were, be sipped from the palms of the hands.", "\u201cThis mountain of blossoming Arjuna trees, planted with Ketakas and anointed by showers of rain, resembles Sugriva freed from his foes.

This brother of Raghava, Lakshmana, his spokesman, charged by him to communicate his wishes, has come at Rama\u2019s command and the son of Tara, the beloved Angada, has been sent to you in all haste by Lakshmana, O King, as his deputy, O Irreproachable Prince.", "\u201cThat valiant warrior Lakshmana stands at the door, his eyes inflamed with anger and consumes the monkeys with his glances, O King. Go quickly and place your head at his feet with all those who belong to you, O Great Monarch, so that his anger may be instantly appeased.", "\u201cThat which the virtuous Rama desires, do you carry out scrupulously so that his wrath be softened; execute his wishes with care, O King, fulfil your pledge and be true to your word!\u201d", "At these words of Angada and his ministers, Sugriva, learning of Lakshmana\u2019s anger, rose from his seat and came to himself.", "Having considered the different aspects of the matter, he addressed his counsellors, who were versed in the sacred formulas, with which he too was conversant and of which he was a strict observer, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI have neither spoken nor acted wrongfully; why is the brother of Raghava, Lakshmana, incensed against me, I ask myself? Evilly disposed persons, enemies ever looking for an occasion to charge me with imaginary crimes, have set the younger brother of Raghava against me. It behoves you all to reflect on the matter wisely in order to discover the cause of his anger. Assuredly I do not fear Lakshmana any more than Raghava, but a friend who becomes angry without reason invariably creates anxiety. It is easy to contract a friendship, but extremely difficult to sustain it, for owing to the fickleness of the mind a friendship can be broken for the most trivial reason. Because of this, I am apprehensive in regards to the magnanimous Rama, for I have not been able to render back a proportionate service to him for that which he has done for me.\u201d", "Sugriva having spoken, Hanuman, that foremost of monkeys, answered according to his understanding, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt is in no way surprising, O Chief of the Monkey Tribes, that you are unable to forget the significant and unexpected service rendered to you by Rama. Assuredly that hero, for your well-being, fearlessly slew Bali, equal to Indra in power. Undoubtedly Rama\u2019s feelings have been wounded, which is evidenced by his sending his brother Lakshmana, the increaser of his happiness, as his deputy, to you. O You, the most skilled in discerning the seasons, autumn is here in all her glory, the Saptacchada and Shyama trees being in full flower, but you, given up to pleasure, does not perceive it. The sky, free from cloud, is filled with brilliant stars and planets, and on all the regions, lakes and rivers, calm prevails.", "\u201cThe time has come to inaugurate the search for Sita of which you are conversant, O Bull among Monkeys. Finding you forgetful, Lakshmana has come to inform you that the hour is at hand. Grieving over the abduction of his spouse, the magnanimous Rama will speak harshly to you through the lips of this hero; is it a cause for wonder? Having acted improperly towards him, I see no other means tending to your welfare but to offer obeisance to Lakshmana and crave his pardon.", "\u201cIt is the duty of counsellors to utter what is true freely to a king and it is for this that after mature reflection I have spoken thus.", "\u201cArmed with his bow, Rama, in his wrath, is able to subdue the whole world as also the Gods, the Asuras and the Gandharvas. It is unwise to provoke one of whom subsequently forgiveness must be craved, the more so, when the recollection of a favour received places one under the obligation of gratitude. Therefore incline thine head before this man with your son and thine entourage, O King, and remain faithful to your promise, as a woman to her husband\u2019s will. It is ill-advised of you to oppose Rama\u2019s behests, even in thought, for you are well aware of this man\u2019s power, whose prowess is equal to Indra and the Gods.\u201d", "At Angada\u2019s request, and in accord with Rama\u2019s command, Lakshmana, the slayer of hostile warriors, entered the beautiful city of Kishkindha situated amidst caves.", "Seeing Lakshmana approaching, the highly powerful monkeys of immense size guarding the gate, stood with joined palms and beholding the son of Dasaratha filled with wrath, breathing heavily, dared not obstruct his entry.", "Then that mighty warrior, gazing about him, beheld that great city decorated with jewels and flowery gardens and rendered magnificent by heaps of precious stones with which it was filled; abounding in spacious buildings and temples, with jewels of every kind in abundance offered as merchandise, it was embellished by flowering trees covered with every desirable fruit.", "Born of the Gods and Gandharvas, monkeys, able to change their form at will, wearing celestial garlands and raiment, added to the beauty of the city by their charming appearance.", "Fragrant with the scent of sandalwood, aloes and lotus, the broad highways were also filled with the intoxicating odour of Maireya and Madhu.", "Lakshmana beheld great mansions also, as high as the Vindhya and Meru mountains, and streams of pure water flowing through the city. He surveyed the enchanting abodes of Angada, Mainda, Dvivida, Gavaya, Gavaksha, Gaja, Sharabha, Vidhumati, Sampati, Suryaksha, Hanuman, Virabahu, Subahu and the great souled Nala, Kumuda, Sushena, Tara, Jambavan, Dadhi-baktra, Nila, Sunetra and Supatala, dwellings like unto white clouds adorned with fragrant garlands and filled with jewels, grain and lovely women.", "The magnificent and inaccessible abode of the King of Monkeys, like the palace of Mahendra, stood on a white rock and was decorated with pinnacled domes resembling the peaks of Mt. Kailasha. Trees in full flower, bearing fruits of every kind of delicious flavour, had been planted there and resembled blue clouds, enchanting with their cool shade, celestial blooms and golden-hued fruit.", "Valiant monkeys, bearing weapons in their hands, guarded the resplendent gateway, the arches of which were of fine gold adorned with magnificent garlands.", "The mighty Lakshmana entered Sugriva\u2019s palace without hindrance as the sun enters a great cloud, and having traversed the seven courtyards, filled with conveyances and seats, he beheld the inner apartments of that Chief of the Monkeys abounding in gold and silver couches with rich coverlets and fine seats.", "On entering there, he heard sweet music blending with the rhythmic cadence of singing to the accompaniment of stringed instruments; and in the private apartments of Sugriva, many a high-born woman, distinguished for her youth and beauty, sumptuously attired, crowned with flowers and engaged in weaving garlands was observed by the high-souled Lakshmana. He noted too, that there were none of the king\u2019s attendants, who were not richly apparelled, happy, well fed and eager to offer their services.", "Hearing the sound of the women\u2019s anklets and girdles, the virtuous Lakshmana became confused and incensed by the tinkling of those ornaments; and that hero stretched the cord of his bow so that the twanging resounded on all sides. Thereafter the valiant Lakshmana, indignant on Rama\u2019s account, withdrew into a corner and stood silent, reflecting on his presumption in entering Sugriva\u2019s private apartments. Hearing the twanging of the bow, Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, recognizing the presence of Lakshmana, began to tremble on his splendid throne.", "He reflected: \u2018As Angada previously informed me, Saumitri, through brotherly solicitude, has undoubtedly come hither.\u2019", "Then that monkey, informed by Angada, his tidings now made doubly sure by the sound of the bow, understood that Lakshmana had come and he grew pale, his heart being filled with apprehension, and Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, addressed Tara, of charming appearance, in well considered words saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lady of Lovely Eyebrows, what cause for displeasure has the younger brother of Rama, who is gentle by nature? Why has he come hither like a raving madman? Dost you know the reason of this prince\u2019s anger? Assuredly that lion among men cannot be enraged without cause. If we have unwittingly displeased him, then considering the matter carefully, inform me without delay or go thyself to him.", "\u201cO Lovely One, by your sweet speech seek to conciliate him. Seeing you, his mind will become tranquil and his anger be allayed, for great warriors do not permit themselves to treat women with harshness. When your gentle words have soothed him and his mind and senses are under control, then I, in my turn, will approach that prince, whose eyes are as large as lotus petals and who is the conqueror of his foes.\u201d", "On this, Tara, swaying slightly, her eyes bright from the drinking of wine, her girdle loosened, hanging by a golden thread, wearing the insignia of royalty, with downcast looks approached Lakshmana. And when that great warrior beheld the consort of the King of the Monkeys, he, restraining his wrath in the presence of a woman, bowed his head, conducting himself like an ascetic.", "Under the influence of wine and observing the benign attitude of that Prince, Tara, discarding all diffidence, addressed him in a conciliatory manner, in words calculated to gain his confidence and said:\u2014", "\u201cFrom whence springs this anger, O Son of a King? Who has failed to carry out thine orders? What reckless person has approached the forest where the trees are dry with a flaming torch?\u201d", "Mollified by this soft speech, Lakshmana replied with studied courtesy:\u2014", "\u201cWhy, given over to lust, does your consort neglect his duty and his own true interests? And you, who art devoted to him, why dost you not give the matter your consideration? He has become indifferent to the affairs of the kingdom and of ourselves and our displeasure. Surrounded by parasites, O Tara, he gives himself up to sensual enjoyments.", "\u201cThe four months appointed as the term of waiting have passed, but the King of the Monkeys in an orgy of drunkenness and pleasure, is unaware of it. Assuredly dissipation is not a proper means to the observance of one\u2019s duty and obligations. Intemperance brings in its train the loss of wealth, virtue and the capacity for enjoyment.", "\u201cNot to requite a service received is to fail wholly in one\u2019s duty and to lose a good friend is immensely injurious to one\u2019s higher interests. From the point of view of prosperity, the greatest of virtues is friendship that is rooted in loyalty and justice; he who fails in these is not fixed in his duty. This being so, what should therefore be done, O You, who art conversant with the path of duty?\u201d", "Hearing these just and reasonable words, expressed with gentleness, Tara assured the prince of the certain fulfilment of his enterprise and again addressed Lakshmana saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Son of a King, this is not the time for recrimination, you should restrain thine anger against my lord; he has thine interests at heart, forgive his folly, O Warrior.", "\u201cO Prince, how can a man endowed with every good quality be indignant with one who is lacking in them? Which of thine equals, despite his good character, would give way to wrath? I know the reason for the displeasure of Sugriva\u2019s valiant ally, I am conversant with the service that you have both rendered us and which we must return. I know further, O Best of Men, that one must master one\u2019s passions. I am aware in what company Sugriva has yielded to lust, which is the cause of the present procrastination that incites your wrath. When man yields to desire he forgets time and place as also his duty and what should rightfully be done. Do you pardon this Leader of the Monkey Race, who, at my side, without shame, gives himself up to sensual enjoyment to which he is the slave. Even the great Rishis, devoted to the practice of asceticism, when carried away by desire, lost control of their minds, how should this monkey,.therefore, volatile by nature, when overcome by passion, not become a slave to pleasure, king though he be?\u201d", "Having addressed these words of profound understanding to Lakshmana, whose courage was immeasurable, the gentle Vanari, with a troubled look, on account of her conjugal affection, then added for the good of her lord:\u2014", "\u201cO Most Excellent of Men, though overcome by desire, Sugriva has long since made preparation to thine advantage.

Wearing superb raiment and wreaths he looked like Mahendra himself, on every side he was surrounded by women adorned with crowns and jewels meet for goddesses, and his reddened eyes gave him the appearance of Antaka.", "Of the hue of fine gold, clasping Ruma firmly in his arms, seated on a magnificent throne, that large-eyed hero saw before him the mighty Saumitri of expansive eyes.", "Seeing that indomitable lion among men, Lakshmana, entering full of wrath, Sugriva was troubled and, observing that Son of Dasaratha breathing heavily and burning with indignation on account of the calamity that had overtaken his brother, the King of the Monkeys rose and, leaving his golden seat that resembled the highly decorated standard of Indra, his eyes inflamed, approached Prince Lakshmana and stood before him like the mighty Kalpa tree. Thereupon the women, lead by Ruma, followed him, like a cluster of stars surrounding the moon.", "Then Lakshmana, filled with ire, said to Sugriva standing amidst the women with Ruma at his side, like the moon surrounded by stars:\u2014", "\u201cThat king who is endowed with great and noble qualities and is compassionate, who has subdued his senses and is grateful and loyal, obtains renown in the world, but the monarch who is rooted in unrighteousness and is unjust to his friends who have rendered him assistance, is the object of opprobrium.", "\u201cTo utter a falsehood with reference to a horse is to be guilty of the death of a hundred horses, in regard to a cow of a thousand cows, but to utter a falsehood in regard to a man is to destroy one\u2019s self as well as one\u2019s kindred.", "\u201cThat ungrateful wretch, who, having gained his end, does not render service for service, is guilty of the murder of all beings, O King of the Plavagas; this is the text recited by Brahma on beholding one who was guilty of ingratitude; it is known throughout the world, O Plavamgama. He who kills a cow or drinks intoxicating liquor or is a thief or violates his vow is still able to expiate his sin, but for him who is guilty of ingratitude, no expiation is possible.", "\u201cYou are an ignoble, false and ungrateful wretch, O Monkey, for having obtained what you didst seek from Rama without requiting his services. Having achieved your desire through Rama, is it not your duty to do everything in your power to recover Sita? Yielding thyself up to sensual delights, untrue to your promise, Rama does not know you for the serpent croaking like a frog, that you are.", "\u201cIn his compassion for you, O Wicked Wretch, the magnanimous Rama enabled you to regain the kingdom of the monkeys.

In all humility, I appeal to you on behalf of Sugriva to control the grief that gives rise to this anger in you.

Kailasha. Hanuman himself was accompanied by thousands of monkeys and the supremely brave Nala was followed by the inhabitants of the woods to the number of an hundred, a thousand and an hundred monkeys. The fortunate Darimukha was escorted by ten kotis of monkeys and with loud shouts took his place beside Sugriva. And Sharabha, Kumuda, Vahni and Rambha came, those monkeys who were able to change their shape at will, with their forces of incalculable numbers covering the entire earth, its mountains and forests. All the monkeys inhabiting the earth gathered round Sugriva, leaping, gambolling and roaring, and those Plavagamas surrounded Sugriva like massed clouds round the sun. Full of courage and energy, they gave voice to repeated shouts of acclamation, bowing their heads in salutation to the King of Monkeys. Others, the leaders of armies, according to tradition, approached the king and stood by his side with joined palms; and Sugriva standing in extreme devotion before Rama, informed him of the arrival of the monkeys and then addressed his generals, who were burning with zeal, saying:\u2014\u201cO Chiefs of Monkeys, station your forces duly or the mountain near rills in the woods and let each ascertain the exact number of his troops.\u201d", "Then the Lord of the Monkeys, his purpose accomplished, said to that lion among men, Rama, the destroyer of hostile hosts:\u2014", "\u201cHere, gathered together, are the foremost of monkeys inhabiting my dominions, who are equal to Mahendra and are able to transport themselves anywhere at will.

I saw the Udaya Mountain rich in gold and the white sea, the abode of Apsaras. Pursued by Bali, flying on and on, O Lord, I turned and continued my course then, changing my direction once more, I made for the south, covered by the Vindhya Forest and embellished with sandal wood trees. Thereafter, seeing Bali among the woods, on the mountains, I went westwards still followed by him.", "\u201cIt is thus that I grew conversant with every kind of region and finally reached the Astachala Mountains.

All the places described by you have been scoured by us, as also all the jungles intertwined by creepers abounding in thickets that are impassable and the hilly districts. Huge animals have been encountered by us, which we have slain, and we have searched these densely wooded regions again and again, O Lord of the Monkeys. It is Hanuman, who is mighty and nobly born, who will discover Maithili; the son of the Wind has undoubtedly gone to where Sita has been taken.\u201d", "The monkey Hanuman, accompanied by Tara and Angada, swiftly set out to the quarter assigned to him by Sugriva. With all those leaders of monkeys, he travelled a great distance and explored the woods and caves of the Vindhya Mountains. Rugged crags, impassable rivers, lakes, vast jungles, groves, innumerable hills covered with forests were searched by the monkeys on every side, without their being able to find Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, anywhere.", "Subsisting on various roots and fruits, they were overcome by fatigue in that uninhabited and waterless region amidst the fearful ravines and solitary places. Having searched that immense area extremely hard of access, with its mighty forests, containing caves, all those foremost of monkeys fearlessly penetrated into another equally inhospitable region, where the trees yielded neither fruit, flowers nor foliage and where the streams were dried up and even roots were rare. There, neither bufialoe nor deer, nor elephants, tigers, birds nor any other animals, that are found in the forest, could be seen. There were neither trees, grass, plants nor herbs, and in that place there were no pleasant pools with flowering or fragrant lotuses and no bees to be observed.", "There dwelt the fortunate Sage, Kandu, a treasury of asceticism, of truthful speech, whose austerities had rendered him invincible and who was irascible, having lost his young son at the age of ten years in the forest. Filled with wrath on account of his death, that great-souled One had laid a curse on the entire vast forest, rendering it unfit to harbour any creature. This inaccessible region, deserted by beasts and birds, the hidden recesses of the woods, the mountain caves and the bends of the rivers were carefully searched by the monkeys in order to carry out Sugriva\u2019s desire, but they were unable to find the daughter of Janaka or her abductor, Ravana, there.", "Having entered a wood, overgrown with creepers and briars, they beheld a terrible titan, of dreadful deeds, cherishing no fear, even for the Gods. Seeing that formidable titan, who stood erect like a great hill, the monkeys pressed close to each other girding up their loins.", "Then that mighty Asura said to them \u201cYou are lost I\u201d and, clenching his fists, rushed upon them in fury, but Angada, the Son of Bali, thinking it was Ravana, struck him with the palm of his hand with such force, that he fell to the earth like a great hill, vomiting blood. When he had ceased to breathe, the triumphant monkeys searched that mountain cavern; and having satisfied themselves that it had been thoroughly explored, those dwellers of the woods entered into another fearful cave. After having searched that place also, they emerged exhausted and wholly dispirited sat down at the foot of a solitary tree.", "Then the eminently wise Angada addressed all the monkeys and, though himself fatigued, exhorted them to take courage, saying:", "\u201cWe have searched the forests, mountains, rivers and impenetrable wilds, valleys and caverns with care, without finding the daughter of Janaka, Sita, or that wicked wretch, the titan, who bore her away. A great part of the time assigned to us by Sugriva, whose commands are inexorable, has elapsed; therefore, banishing languor, despondency, torpor and fatigue, together let us examine every region once again. Search in such a way that Sita may be discovered by us. Perseverance, ability and ardour are said to conduce to success; I therefore address you thus:\u2014O Dwellers in the Woods, explore the whole inaccessible forest to-day without counting the cost, success will wholly depend on your exertions; to permit yourselves to be overcome by fatigue or give way to sleep is not fitting. Sugriva is irascible and inflicts harsh punishments; he is ever to be feared, as also the magnanimous Rama. I speak in your own interests; therefore, if you concur, act accordingly or let someone point out what alternative will benefit us all, O Monkeys.\u201d", "Hearing Angada\u2019s words, Gandhamadana, though faint from thirst and fatigue, spoke in clear accents, saying:\u2014\u201cThat which Angada has said is worthy of him and is appropriate and timely, let us act upon it! Let us search the hills, caves, rocks, desert places and waterfalls, in accord with the instructions given by Sugriva; let us scour the forest and the mountain ridges together!\u201d", "Then the monkeys, rising, full of valour, began to range the south covered by the Vindhya forests, afresh. Scaling the mountain that resembled an autumnal cloud, rich in silver, with its innumerable peaks and valleys, those foremost of monkeys, eager to find Sita, ranged the enchanting Lodhra forests and the woods of Saptaparna trees. Ascending to the summit of the mountain, though endued with immense energy, they were overcome with fatigue, yet they did not see Vaidehi, the beloved consort of Rama, anywhere. Having surveyed that hill with its innumerable ravines, as far as eye could see, the monkeys looking on every side, descended and, reaching the base, harassed and beside themselves, halted for an instant under a tree; then finding themselves less fatigued, they prepared to explore the southern region again.", "Thereafter the chiefs of the monkeys, with Hanuman at their head, began to range the Vindhya hills once more.", "The Monkey Hanuman, in company with the General Tara and Angada, once again explored the deep woods and ravines of the Vindhya range. Those monkeys searched the caverns which resounded with the roar of lions and tigers as well as the inaccessible and mighty torrents. Finally they came to the southwestern summit of the mountain and, while they rested there, time passed.", "That region is hard to explore on account of the vast extent of the forests and the dangerous ravines and caverns; nevertheless the Son of the Wind examined it all thoroughly. Separated from each other by a short distance, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Mainda, Dvivida, Hanuman and Jambavan, the youthful Prince Angada and Tara, dwellers of the woods, began to search those regions in the south covered by the mountain range.", "While they were exploring this place on every side, they observed the opening to a cave named Rikshabila, difficult of entry, guarded by a giant. Tortured with hunger and thirst and overcome with exhaustion they espied this cavity overgrown by trees, bushes and creepers, from which herons, swans, geese and waterfowl were issuing, dripping with water and covered with the pollen of lotuses.", "Drawing near to that fragrant cave, difficult of access, those monkeys were struck with astonishment and desired to enter it. Then those foremost of monkeys, seeing signs of water, full of joy, approached that subterranean chamber abounding in every kind of creature, resembling the abode of Indra, which was impenetrable and fearful to behold.", "And Hanuman, the son of the Wind-god, who resembled the peak of a mountain, said to those redoubtable monkeys, who dwelt in the woods and forests:\u2014\u201cWe have explored the southern region covered with a chain of mountains; we are exhausted with fatigue and unable to find Maithili. From yonder cave, swans, cranes, herons and waterfowl are emerging on every side, drenched with water. Without doubt there is a well or pool to be found there for these trees at the mouth of the cave are green.\u201d", "Hanuman having spoken thus, all the monkeys entered into the dark cave, bereft of sun and moon, that caused their hair to stand on end. They heard the roar of lions and the sound of deer and birds and those invincible monkeys felt their courage and prowess fail; moving with the speed of the wind and despite the darkness, their sight being unimpaired, they penetrated deep into the cave and beheld a luminous, enchanting and marvellous region filled with different kinds of trees of varying fragrance. Pressing close to one another, they advanced four miles into the interior and fainting with fatigue, bewildered, seeking for water, they continued to descend into the darkness. Emaciated, their faces woe-begone, spent, despairing of their Eves, those monkeys then beheld a light. Happily they approached that spot and saw trees glistening like gold, possessing the brilliance of fire, and they beheld Salas, Talas, Tamalas, Punnagas, Vanjulas, Dhavas, Champakas, Nagavrikshas and Karnikaras in full flower with clusters of golden blossom, crimson buds, twigs and creepers adorning them, dazzling as the dawn, their trunks being of emerald and their bark luminous. There were also lakes of blue lotus, abounding in waterfowl, there, and great golden trees encircled that place, that shone like the first light of dawn and fishes of gold and enormous lotuses were to be seen in pools of tranquil waters. Gold and silver palaces were to be found there with little windows of refined gold festooned with chains of pearls, the floors paved with silver and gold and encrusted with pearls and diamonds.", "And the monkeys beheld splendid mansions everywhere and trees laden with fruit and flowers that shone like coral and precious gems and golden bees and honey in abundance. Couches and marvellous seats of immense size, decorated with gold and diamonds, drew their gaze, as well as gold and silver vessels, heaps of aloes and sandal, pure foods, fruits and roots, costly vehicles, delicious syrups, priceless raiment and great piles of woollen cloths and wonderful skins.", "Whilst wandering here and there about that subterranean chamber, those courageous monkeys beheld a woman at a short distance from them. Attired in robes of bark and a black antelope skin, that ascetic, given to fasting, shone with a great effulgence.", "Astonished, those monkeys halted suddenly and Hanuman addressed her saying:\u2014\u201cWho art you? To whom does this cavern belong?\u201d", "Bowing down to that aged woman, Hanuman, who resembled a mountain, with joined palms, enquired of her: \u201cWho art you? To whom does this retreat, this cave and its jewels belong?\u201d", "Having spoken thus to that blessed ascetic given to the practice of austerity, who was clad in bark and a black antelope skin, Hanuman added:\u2014", "\u201cWe entered this cave enveloped in darkness being wholly exhausted with hunger and thirst and overcome with fatigue; having penetrated into the depths to seek for something to eat, we have become distracted on seeing all these marvels so that we have almost taken leave of our senses.", "\u201cTo whom do these golden trees belong, that shine like the sun about to rise and these pure foods, roots and fruits; these mansions of gold and silver with their windows of gold refined in the crucible and their network of pearls? Who has produced these golden trees covered with marvellous flowers and fruit emitting a delicious fragrance, the golden lotuses that float on the pure waters, the golden fish and the turtles? Are they sprung from your power or do they owe their existence to another? It behoves you to tell us, who are ignorant in the matter.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Hanuman, the virtuous ascetic, engaged in the welfare of all beings, replied to Hanuman saying:\u2014\u201cO Foremost of Monkeys, Maya is the name of the magician of great powers, by whom this entire golden grove has been constructed. He who created this enchanting and celestial place was formerly the chief architect of the Giants [i.e., Danavas or Daityas]. Having practised austerity for a thousand years in the vast forest, he obtained a boon from the Grandsire of the World, in virtue of which he attained complete mastery in his art, as well as an absolute control over the materials required therein. Having accomplished everything, that wonderful one, commanding every enjoyment, for a time lived happily in the mighty forest. Thereafter he conceived a great passion for the nymph Hema, whereupon Purandara hurled his thunderbolt at him and slew him.", "\u201cThen Brahma bestowed this marvellous forest with his golden mansion on Hema with the perpetual enjoyment of her desires. I, Swayamprabha by name, the daughter of Merusavarni, guard this dwelling belonging to Hema, who, skilled in the arts of dancing and singing, is my dear friend, O Foremost of Monkeys! By her favour, this vast forest has been given into my hands. Now tell me for what purpose and with what motive you have come hither? Why are you roaming in these inaccessible woods? Having partaken of these fruits and roots and drunk of the pure water, tell me all.\u201d", "That virtuous ascetic, greatly mystified, addressed all those leaders of monkeys who were now rested, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Monkeys, if, satisfied by the fruits, your fatigue is alleviated, I would fain listen to your story if it is fit to be heard by me.\u201d", "Hearing these words, Hanuman, the Son of Maruta began to relate all with perfect candour, saying: \u201cThe Sovereign of the whole world, Rama, who is equal to Mahendra and Varuna, the illustrious son of Dasaratha, retired to the Dandaka Forest in company with his brother Lakshmana and his consort Vaidehi. The latter was forcibly carried away by Ravana.", "\u201cHis friend is that valiant monkey named Sugriva. By that monarch, the foremost of monkeys, we have been sent hither and with the assistance of those led by Angada, we have been dispatched to search the southern region inhabited by Agastya and protected by Yama. We have been commissioned to search for Sita, the daughter of Videha and the demon Ravana, who is able to change his form at will. Having scoured the forests and the seas of the south, overcome with hunger, we sat down at the foot of the trees. Our faces drained of colour, absorbed in thought, we were sunk in an ocean of anxiety which we were unable to cross.", "\u201cCasting our eyes round, we observed a huge cave hidden by trees and creepers and enveloped in gloom. Now swans, geese and osprey flew out from that cave their wings dripping with water, and I said to those monkeys, \u2018Let us enter there!\u2019 which all agreed to do. Anxious to accomplish our purpose, we went in grasping each others hands, thus forcing an entry into that dark cave; this is our purpose and the reason why we have come hither. Having come here, famished and exhausted, we, who were sorely tried by hunger, have been entertained on fruits and roots with the traditional hospitality. You have saved us, who were weary and suffering from starvation; now say what service the monkeys may render you in return?\u201d", "Thus addressed by the apes, the all-knowing Swayamprabha replied to those monkey leaders, saying: \u201clam well pleased with all these excellent monkeys; I am but fulfilling my duty and have no need of anything.\u201d", "Thus answered in words filled with nobility and virtue, Hanuman addressed that irreproachable lady saying: \u201cWe have all found refuge with you, O Virtuous Ascetic, but the time fixed by the magnanimous Sugriva has run out since we entered the cave, it behoves you, therefore, to assist us to leave this place. If the commands of Sugriva be disregarded, it will mean death for us. Please deliver us all; the fear of Sugriva afflicts us. Great is the task that has been undertaken by us and if we remain here, that work of ours will not be accomplished.\u201d", "Thus addressed by Hanuman, the ascetic answered him saying:\u2014\u201cFor a living being to emerge from this cave alive, is hard, but by the power of my asceticism acquired through self control I shall deliver all the monkeys from this subterranean chamber. Do you all close your eyes, for none will succeed in issuing from this place if their eyes remain open.\u201d", "Then, desirous of going out, all those magnanimous monkeys instantly closed their eyes covering them with their hands, possessed of slender fingers, and in the twinkling of an eye, the ascetic transported them outside the cave and having saved them from danger, in order to encourage them, said:\u2014", "\u201cThis is the auspicious Vindhya Mountain covered with trees and herbs, there the Prasravana Mountain and the great ocean. May good fortune attend you! I go to my abode, O Foremost of Monkeys.\u201d", "With these words Swayamprabha re-entered the cave.", "Then the monkeys beheld that awe-inspiring ocean, the abode of Varuna, shoreless, thunderous and abounding in huge billows.", "Now the month fixed by the king as the term set for the search had passed while they were exploring that mountain fastness, the miraculous creation of Maya. Sitting down at the foot of the Vindhya Mountain amidst the blossoming trees, those high-souled monkeys anxiously began to reflect among themselves.", "Perceiving the spring trees bending beneath the weight of flowers interlaced by hundreds of creepers, they were filled with apprehension. Recognizing the advent of spring and knowing the time appointed for their task had run out, each in turn sank to the ground.", "Then that monkey having the shoulders of a lion, with plump and long arms, the youthful Prince Angada, endowed with wisdom, duly honouring the aged apes and other dwellers in the woods, spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cAt the command of the monarch of the monkeys, we set out and, while we sojourned in the cave, a full month has passed away, O Monkeys. The month Ashvayuj was the time fixed, which was not to be exceeded. This is known to you! What should now be done? Receiving the mandate from your master, you who are his trusted men, politic, devoted to his welfare, skilled in every work, incomparable in its execution and renowned in every quarter, have set out on this campaign with me as your appointed leader. Now, having failed to attain our objective, we shall certainly die, of this there is no shadow of doubt. Who, failing to execute the commands of the King of the Monkeys, can live at ease? The time allotted by Sugriva has run out, all that remains is for us, the dwellers in the woods, to die fasting. Stem by nature, jealous of his authority, he will not forgive us if we return having transgressed his orders. He will regard it as a crime if we come before him without news of Sita; it is therefore better to allow ourselves to die of hunger here than give up all hope of seeing our sons, wives, wealth and homes. It were preferable to die here than perish ignominously at the hands of Sugriva. Further, I was not installed as heir-apparent by Sugriva but by Rama, that king among men of immortal exploits. Entertaining enmity to me of old, the king, finding me at fault, will determine to take my life by cruel means. Of what use is it to meet death in the presence of my friends who will witness the last moments of my existence? I shall remain here cn the sacred shore of the sea for the last supreme fast.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the crown prince, all those monkeys, exclaimed in sympathy:\u2014", "\u201cSugriva is harsh by nature and Raghava is devoted to his tender spouse. The king, perceiving that the time has past without our having been successful in our undertaking and that we have not found Vaidehi, will certainly put us to death in order to do what is agreeable to Rama. Those who fail (to execute his commands) may not enter the presence of a king. Having come hither as the principal servants of Sugriva, we must either find Sita or obtain information concerning her or else we must enter the region of Yama, O Hero.\u201d", "Hearing the monkeys speak thus in their terror, the General Tara said:\u2014\u2022\u201cOf what use is it to yield to despair? Let us reenter the subterranean chamber and take up our abode there. That place abounding in flowers, food and water, which has been created by the power of illusion, is inaccessible. There we need not fear Purandara Himself or Raghava or the King of the Monkeys.\u201d", "At these words to which Angada himself assented, all the monkeys with renewed confidence, cried:\u2014\u201cWithout delay, let us from now on employ those means that will save us from death.\u201d", "When the General Tara, who was as radiant as the moon, had spoken thus, Hanuman deemed that Angada had already usurped supreme authority. He knew the son of Bali to be endowed with the eightfold intelligence, the four powers and the fourteen qualities [see notes below], to be possessed of valour, energy and martial ardour, waxing in glory like the moon in the bright fortnight, the equal of Brihaspati in wisdom, in bravery resembling his sire and obedient to Tara\u2019s counsel as Purandara regards the instruction of Shukra. Thereupon, Hanuman, versed in all branches of learning, resolved to win over Angada, who had become lax in the service of his sovereign and bring him back to the right path. Reflecting on the four means for bringing about peace, he chose the second, that of sow'ing dissension amongst the monkeys by subtle suggestion; when the disaffection was general, he sought to instil fear in Angada\u2019s heart, by harsh words uttered in severe tones:\u2014", "He said:\u2014\u201cO Son of Bali, surely you are a warrior more skilful even than your sire and art able to govern the monkey kingdom as well as he, but, O Foremost of Monkeys, the apes were ever fickle by nature. Bereft of their wives and sons, they will never suffer your rule. This I declare to you in the presence of all! Neither by conciliation, gifts nor penalties shaft you succeed in drawing Jambavan, Nila, the mighty ape, Suhotra, or myself to your side. One who is strong can overcome the weak and usurp his place, therefore, he who is weak should, for his own safety, never incur the enmity of the strong. This cave, that you deemest to be a safe refiige and which is said to be impregnable, can easily be penetrated by Lakshmana with his arrows. Formerly this tiny rift was made by Indra hurling his thunderbolt against it, but Lakshmana will pierce it like a leaf by means of his keen arrows. He possesses innumerable arrows of this kind, whose impact resembles lightning, capable of shattering the mountains themselves.", "\u201cO Scourge of Your Foes, as soon as you dost install thyself in that place, the monkeys, remembering their wives and sons, will decide to forsake you. Pining for domestic happiness, ever restless, anxious and weary of their pitiable plight, they will abandon you. Thereafter, bereft of friends, relatives and those who seek your welfare, even the trembling of a blade of grass will fill you with terror.", "\u201cLakshmana\u2019s arrows, irresistible in flight, keen, formidable and of exceeding velocity, will transfix you where you have sought to conceal thyself.", "\u201cIf, however, assuming a humble guise, you, with us, dost present thyself before Sugriva, he will establish you in the kingdom and restore you as rightful heir. A virtuous monarch, firm in his vows, honorable and loyal, he desires your welfare and will assuredly not kill you. Your paternal uncle is devoted to your mother and wishes to do what is agreeable to her, this is the purpose of his life and she has no other son, therefore, O Angada, return with us.\u201d", "Notes regarding the intelligences, powers and qualities:", "Eightfold Intelligence\u2014The quality of accepting the truth and what is right, cherishing it, remembering it, propagating it. Knowledge of the positive and negative side of a matter. Knowledge of the ultimate essence.", "Four Powers\u2014Physical power, mental power, power of resource, power of making friends.", "Fourteen Qualities\u2014Knowledge of Time and Place. Endurance. Empirical knowledge. Skill. Physical strength. Power to conceal one\u2019s counsel. The honouring of one\u2019s obligations and promises. Heroism. Appreciation of the enemy\u2019s strength and one\u2019s own in relation to it. Gratitude. Beneficence to one\u2019s dependents or suppliants. Non-acceptance of insult. Freedom from uncontrolled movements. Poise.", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s speech uttered with humility, filled with wisdom and justice and reflecting honour on Sugriva, Angada answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cStability, purity of mind and disposition, compassion, rectitude, daring and perseverance are unknown to Sugriva. He who, while her son was living, united himself to the beloved queen of his elder brother, on whom he should rightfully have looked as a mother, is to be condemned. What does he know of morality who, while his brother was in the grip of an Asura, closed up the opening of the cave? What gratitude will he manifest who, having clasped his hand in friendship, forgot the favours received from his great benefactor, Raghava, of imperishable deeds? Where is righteousness in one who directed us to search for Sita here, not from fear of disloyalty but of Lakshmana? Who would trust that fickle, impious and ungrateful wretch, more especially those sprung from his own race? Whether he be possessed of good qualities or no, having established me in the kingdom, will he suffer the son of his enemy to live? How can I, whose counsels have been disclosed, who have been found guilty, who am powerless, poor and weak, expect to survive if I repair to Kishkindha? In his desire to retain the throne, Sugriva, who is wily, cunning and cruel, will assuredly place me in chains. For me death through fasting is preferable to being tortured and confined. Let all the monkeys abandon me here and return home. I vow I shall never reenter the city but shall stay here and fast to the end; death is better for me.", "\u201cBowing to the king and also to the mighty Raghava, enquire after their welfare for me and bring news of my health and state to my adopted mother Ruma. To Tara, my real mother, offer consolation, for she is compassionate and pious and naturally full of love for her son. When she learns of my death, she will certainly yield up her life.\u201d", "Having said this, Angada, making obeisance to the elders, his countenance woe-begone, weeping, spreading out some kusha grass sat down on the ground; as he sat there, those foremost of monkeys groaned, burning tears falling from their eyes. Thereupon surrounding Angada, condemning Sugriva and praising Bali, those monkeys resolved to starve themselves to death and, seating themselves on the seashore on heaps of darbha grass, pointing towards the south, those excellent monkeys sipping water, facing the east, resolved to die, saying:\u2014\u201cThis is better for us 1\u201d", "As they spoke of the exile of Rama, the death of Dasaratha, the carnage in Janasthana, the slaying of Jatayu, the abduction of Vaidehi, the killing of Bali and the wrath of Raghava, those monkeys were filled with fear; and while those innumerable monkeys, resembling the peaks of mountains sat there, the whole region with its torrents and caverns resounded with their lamentations like the roll of thunder in the skies.", "While the monkeys remained seated on the mountain plateau resolved on their last great fast, the King of the Vultures by chance came to that place. That long-lived bird, the fortunate brother of Jatayu, was renowned for his strength and prowess.", "Issuing from a cave on the mighty Vindhya Mountain, he observed the monkeys seated there and, highly gratified, said:\u2014\u201cEvery man reaps the fruit of his former acts, on account of this, after a long time, this food comes to me. I shall eat up these monkeys one by one as they die.\u201d", "Eyeing those apes, the Vulture expressed himself thus, and hearing the utterance of that famished bird, Angada, full of apprehension, addressed Hanuman in faint accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cBehold, on account of Sita, Death, the descendant of Vivasvat, has come to this place to destroy the monkeys. Rama\u2019s purpose not having been effected nor the mandate of the king obeyed, this calamity has overtaken the monkeys unaware. You are conversant in detail with all that Jatayu, that Prince of Vultures did for the sake of Sita. All beings, even those born of the mating of beasts, desire to please Rama at the cost of their lives as we have done. On account of Rama\u2019s love and compassion, people bear each other affection and pity. The blessed Jatayu voluntarily laid down his life for the good of Rama; we too, exhausted and about to die, came to this forest to render a service to the Son of Raghu. We have searched the woods in vain for Maithili. Happy is that Prince of Vultures who was slain in combat by Ravana for he is freed from the fear of Sugriva and has attained the supreme abode. The death of Jatayu and King Dasaratha and the abduction of Sita has placed the monkeys in jeopardy. The sojourn of Rama and Lakshmana in the forest with Sita, Raghava\u2019s slaying of Bali with an arrow, the slaughter of innumerable demons by Rama in his wrath, all owe their origin to those boons granted to Kaikeyi.\u201d", "Hearing these piteous words and seeing the monkeys stretched on the ground the magnanimous King of the Vultures was deeply moved and that sharp beaked bird cried out:\u2014", "\u201cWho is it who, causing my heart to tremble, speaks thus of the death of my brother, dearer to me than life itself? How did the demon and the vulture come to fight in Janasthana? It is after a long time that I hear the name of my brother spoken. I wish to descend from this lofty mountain height. I am well pleased to hear of my youthful and valiant brother, renowned for his exploits. I wish to learn of the death of my brother, Jatayu, O Foremost of Monkeys, and how King Dasaratha, whose elder son is Rama, beloved of his elders, came to be his friend? I am unable to fly in consequence of my wings having been scorched by the rays of the sun. Assist me to descend from this mountain, O Conquerers of your Foes!\u201d", "Though the voice of Sampati faltered on account of grief, the Chiefs of the Monkeys did not trust him, doubting his intentions.", "Seated for the purpose of fasting to death, the monkeys, seeing that vulture, framed the following resolution, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLet us help him to descend and he will then devour us all; should he do so, while we are seated here fasting, we shall have achieved our purpose and shall speedily attain success.\u201d", "Having thus resolved, they assisted the vulture to descend from the summit of the mountain and Angada addressed him saying:\u2014", "\u201cThere was a great King of the Monkeys named Riksharajas, the founder of our race; he was my grandsire, O Bird. He had two virtuous sons, Bali and Sugriva, both were exceedingly powerful. My father Bali, was famed throughout the world for his exploits.", "\u201cNow it happened that the Sovereign of the whole earth, the descendant of Ikshvaku, the great and illustrious car warrior, Rama, the son of King Dasaratha, obedient to the injunctions of his sire, fixed in the path of righteousness, entered the forest of Dandaka with his brother Lakshmana and his consort Vaidehi. His spouse was forcibly borne away from Janasthana by Ravana and the friend of Rama\u2019s father, the Prince of Vultures, Jatayu, observed Sita, Videha\u2019s daughter, being carried through the air. Having shattered Ravana\u2019s chariot and released Maithili, that vulture being old and exhausted finally fell under Ravana\u2019s blows. Slain by the powerful Ravana, he had his funeral rites performed by Rama himself and attained the celestial abode. Then Raghava allied himself with my paternal uncle, Sugriva, and slew my sire, who had banished him from the kingdom with his ministers.", "\u201cHaving killed Bali, Rama installed Sugriva as Lord and Monarch of all the Monkeys. We have been sent by him in all directions under Rama\u2019s orders to search for Sita but we have not found Vaidehi, as by night one is unable to perceive the splendour of the sun. Having explored the Dandaka Forest, we, through ignorance, penetrated into a cave through a rift in the earth. That cavern was constructed by the illusive power of Maya and there we passed the month fixed by the King of the Monkeys, as the term appointed; while executing the commands of Sugriva, we exceeded the time fixed and from fear have seated ourselves here, resolved to die of hunger, for, if we return to face the wrath of Kakutstha, Sugriva and Lakshmana, we shall surely be put to death!\u201d", "Hearing the pitiful narrative of the monkeys, who had resolved to give up their lives, the vulture in mournful accents, with tears in his eyes, answered them saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Monkeys, you have told me, that Jatayu, my younger brother, was slain in combat by Ravana, who was his superior in strength. Old and bereft of my wings, I can only resign myself to these tidings for I no longer have the power to avenge my brother\u2019s death.", "\u201cFormerly, when Indra slew the demon Vritra, my brother and I, wishing to prove which of us was superior, soared into the sky, drawing nearer and nearer to the sun with its aureole of rays. Flinging ourselves into the currents of air, we rose rapidly higher and higher, but the sun having reached its zenith, Jatayu grew faint. Seeing my brother tormented by the sun\u2019s rays, I covered him affectionately with my wings, for he was suffering greatly, whereupon they were scorched and I fell on the Vindhya Mountain, O Foremost of Monkeys, where I remained, not knowing what had befallen him.\u201d", "Thus addressed by Sampati, Jatayu\u2019s brother, the eminently sagacious Prince Angada answered :\u2014\u201cIf you are indeed the brother of Jatayu and hast heard what I have related, then tell us, dost you know aught of that titan\u2019s abode? Say, if you knowest, whether the retreat of that short-sighted, vilest of demons, Ravana, is near or far away?\u201d", "Then the illustrious elder brother of Jatayu answered in words worthy of him, causing delight to the monkeys, and said: \u201cO Monkeys, my pinions being burnt, I am a vulture bereft of strength, yet by my words alone, I shall render Rama a signal service.", "\u201cI know the realm of Varuna and those covered by Vishnu\u2019s three strides.

Tearing off her ornaments she cast them on the earth; her silken cloak, resembling the rays of the sun striking on a mountain summit, shone against the dark skin of the demon like a lightning flash irradiating a cloudy sky. Since she was calling \u2018Rama\u2019, \u2018Rama\u2019 I believe her to have been Sita. Now hear me, and I will tell you where the abode of that demon is to be found.", "\u201cThe son of Vishravas and brother of Kuvera, that demon, named Ravana, resides in the city of Lanka, constructed by Vishvakarma, which lies a full hundred yojanas from here on an island in the sea, furnished with golden gateways and ramparts of Kancana gold, with lofty palaces gleaming with Hema gold adorning it. A great wall, bright as the sun, encircles it, and it is there that the unfortunate Vaidehi, attired in a silken cloth, is confined in Ravana\u2019s inner apartments, carefully guarded by demon women. It is there you will find Sita.", "\u201cFour hundred miles from here on the southern shore of the sea dwells Ravana. O Monkeys, hie thither speedily and demonstrate your valour! By supernatural means, I know that having seen that place you will return. The first course is the path taken by the fork-tailed shrikes and others living on grain; the second by those who live on insects and fruit; the third by cocks; the fourth by herons, hawks and birds of prey; the fifth by vultures; the sixth by swans endowed with strength, energy, youth and beauty and the last by eagles; we have all derived our origin from Vainateya, O Foremost of Monkeys. I shall avenge that execrable deed of that eater of flesh (Ravana) as also his cruelty to my brother.", "\u201cResting here, I am able to see Ravana and Janaki, for we all possess the supersensual sight of Supama. It is by virtue of our nature and on account of the food we eat, that we can see clearly to a distance of four hundred miles. We are instinctively drawn to search for our food at a distance, whilst other birds scratch it up with their claws at the foot of the trees where they roost, their sight being limited.", "\u201cDo you look about for a means to cross over the salty waves; having found Vaidehi, return, your purpose accomplished. Now I desire to be taken by you to the shore of the sea, the abode of Varuna; I will there perform the water ritual for the spirit of my high-souled brother, who has gone to the celestial abode.\u201d", "At those words those mighty monkeys carried Sampati, whose wings had been burnt, to the shore of the ocean, after which they brought back that King of the Birds to the Vindhya Mountain; and, having received the information concerning Sita, they experienced great joy.", "Hearing these words, sweet as nectar, uttered by the Vulture King, the monkey chiefs were filled with relief.", "Then Jambavan, the foremost among the apes, with all the monkeys, rising from the ground, said to the Vulture King:\u2014\u201cWhere is Sita? Who has seen her? Who has carried away Mithila\u2019s daughter? Do you tell us all this and thus be the means of saving the dwellers in the woods.

There I was, looking down, guarding the pass, when suddenly I observed someone resembling a mass of collyrium, carrying a woman as beautiful as the dawn. Seeing them, I resolved to seize them for my prey, but he humbly implored me in peaceful accents to let him pass. None on earth, not even the wicked, devour the peaceful willingly, how much less a creature like myself! He passed on quickly, pushing away the air, as it were, with his energy.", "Thereafter, those beings that inhabit space approached me and paid obeisance to me and the great Rishis said tome:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018\u201cBy good fortune Sita still lives!

But hear how I can help you with my word and knowledge, so that you can manifest your prowess! By my speech and my experience I will do what is agreeable to you. I shall make the concern of the son of Dasaratha my concern, do not doubt it. Possessed as you are of intelligence, energy and wisdom, incapable of being overcome even by the Gods, you have been sent here by the King of the Monkeys. The arrows of Rama and Lakshmana furnished with heron plumes are able to destroy the Three Worlds. Although the ten-necked Ravana is endowed with strength and energy, yet assuredly none can resist your united efforts! There is no need for further delay. Now accomplish your purpose.

Formerly Jatayu and I visited that sage many times.", "\u201cIn that neighbourhood, soft and fragrant breezes blew and there was no tree without flowers or fruit. Approaching that sacred hermitage, desirous of seeing the blessed Nishakara, I waited at the foot of a tree. Then, at a distance, I beheld that Rishi, blazing with effulgence, who, having performed his ablutions, was returning towards the north.", "\u201cAs all living beings surround a giver, so was he surrounded by bears, srimaras, tigers, lions and snakes of various kinds.

In former times, I knew two vultures resembling the wind in speed, who were brothers, able to change their shape at will. You are, I know, the elder, Sampati, and Jatayu is your younger brother. Both assuming human shape were wont to massage my feet with their hands.", "\u201c\u2018By what disease hast you been afflicted? From whence comes the loss of your wings?

Reaching a great height together, we looked down on the earth with its various cities that appeared like chariot wheels. Sometimes the sound of musical instruments reached us, at others the tinkling of ornaments. In certain places we saw many damsels clad in red who were singing.", "\u201cPassing rapidly through the air, we followed the path of the sun and observed a forest intersected with green rides; the mountains appeared like pebbles and the rivers like threads binding the earth; Himavat, Vindhya and that mighty mountain, Meru resembled elephants standing in a pond.", "\u201cNevertheless we were perspiring freely and were filled with anxiety and extremely fatigued, no longer being able, in our bewilderment, to distinguish between the south, west or the quarter presided over by Fire; the earth seemed to us to have been consumed by flames, as at the end of the world period. My mind and my eyes failing, with a violent effort I fixed them on the sun and with great difficulty succeeded in doing so. The blazing orb seemed to us much larger than the earth in extent, and at that instant, Jatayu, without speaking to me, began to fall. Seeing this, I flew down from the sky and covered him with my wings, in consequence of which my brother was not burnt, but I, in my arrogance was scorched and thrown out of the wind\u2019s course. I surmised that Jatayu had fallen in Janasthana, but my wings scathed, deprived of strength, I fell on the Vindhya Mountain.", "\u201cBereft of my dominion, my brother, my wings and my power, I now long to hurl myself headlong from the summit of this mountain and put an end to my existence.\u201d", "\u201cHaving spoken thus to that foremost of Sages, in my distress, I began to weep, and that blessed One, reflecting for a while, said to me:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Your two wings with their feathers will grow again and you will recover your sight, thine energy and your prowess.

And, albeit tempted by delicious viands and objects of enjoyment and desire, that noble and illustrious one, overcome by grief, will not partake of them. Then Vasava learning of this will offer her \u2018payasa\u2019 resembling ambrosia that the Gods themselves only obtain with difficulty. Receiving this food, Maithili, knowing it to come from Indra, will offer part of it to Rama, by pouring it on the ground, saying:\u2014\u2018Whether my husband or his younger brother still live or have attained the celestial state, may this food be acceptable to them.\u2019", "\u201c\u2018Rama\u2019s envoys having been sent hither, it will be for you to inform them of the facts relating to Sita, O Airy Traveller!

And seeing the ocean which at times appeared to be asleep, at others playful, sometimes covered with huge waves and thronged with aquatic animals, causing their hair to stand on end, those foremost of monkeys were amazed and became despondent. Beholding that ocean incapable of being traversed, even as the sky itself, the monkeys began to lament, crying: \u201cWhat is now to be done?\u201d", "Then the foremost of the monkeys, the mighty Angada, seeing the despair of the army at the sight of the sea, began to reassure those warriors afflicted with terror, saying:\u2014", "\u201cOne should never give way to agitation, of all things it is the most fatal: agitation destroys a man even as a provoked serpent does a child.

Gaya speaking first, said:\u2014", "\u201cI can leap a hundred miles!\u201d and Gavaksha said:\u2014\u201cI can leap two hundred!\u201d Then the monkey Sharabha said to his companions:\u2014\u201cI am able to leap three hundred miles, O Monkeys!\u201d thereafter Rishabha said, \u201cI can undoubtedly cross over four hundred miles!\u201d and the mighty Gandhamadana said \u201cI can leap five hundred miles!\u201d In his turn the monkey, Mainda, said \u201cAnd I, six hundred miles\u201d and the illustrious Dvivida \u201cWithout difficulty I can leap over seven hundred miles!\u201d Then Sushena, full of energy, the best of monkeys said, \u201cI declare that I can leap eight hundred miles!\u201d", "And as they were speaking thus, the oldest of them, Jambavan, offering salutations to them all, spoke in this wise:\u2014\u201cFormerly I, also, had the power of motion but now I am advanced in years. Nevertheless in the present situation, nothing should be overlooked to assure the success of both Rama\u2019s and the King of Monkeys\u2019 mission: I shall therefore leap three hundred miles. There is no doubt whatever about this.\u201d Then Jambavan, addressing all those monkeys, added: \u201cAlas! I have assuredly not the strength for that! Of old, I circumambulated the eternal Vishnu when he covered the world in three strides at the sacrifice of Virocana\u2019s son; now, however, I am old and tire quickly. When I was young, my energy was great and unmatched; today, I can only go as far as I have told you, which is not sufficient to bring success to our undertaking.\u201d", "Thereupon the sagacious Angada, bowing to that mighty monkey, addressed him in pregnant words, saying: \u201cI am able to leap these four hundred miles easily but should I be able to return? Nothing is certain I\u201d", "Thereat Jambavan answered that excellent monkey and said: \u201cO Foremost of Monkeys, your power of motion is well known, but art you able to cross over eight hundred miles? It is not fitting that you should do so. My Dear Son, the master must in no way be commanded by his servants; it is for you to order this expedition. You are our leader and our only good. The head of the army is, as it were, the wife, who should constantly be protected; this is your role, O Dear Child. One should take care of the root of a thing, this is the practice of men of experience; the root being sound, the juices that have for their purpose the maturing of the fruit will be safeguarded. You are the essential part of this undertaking and, O Subduer of Your Foes, you, furnished with wisdom and valour, art the principle underlying it. You are our superior and the son of our superior, O Excellent One; with your support we shall be able to accomplish our mission.\u201d", "Thus, in his great wisdom, Jambavan spoke and that mighty monkey born of Bali, Angada, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cIf I do not go nor any among these powerful monkeys does so, then undoubtedly we must begin our supreme fast once more, for if we return without having fulfilled the commands of that lord of the monkeys, then I do not see how we can hope to preserve our lives. Whether he show clemency or wrath, he is the chief of the monkeys and to disregard his will means death. In this matter no other alternative is possible; therefore it is for you who are able to see clearly to reflect upon it.\u201d", "Thus spoke Angada and that powerful and heroic monkey, Jambavan, answered him in felicitous words saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Warrior, this mission will be carried out without obstruction! I will call on the one who is able to accomplish it.\u201d", "Thereupon that heroic monkey sent for the foremost of the apes, Hanuman, who was sitting tranquilly apart.", "Perceiving the discouragement of that great army composed of hundreds and thousands of monkeys, Jambavan said to Hanuman:\u2014", "\u201cO Warrior, foremost among the multitude, you who art versed in the scriptures, why art you sitting apart, silent?

Then Maruta perceived her rounded, well-proportioned thighs and her breasts touching each other and her amiable and pleasing mien. Beholding that youthful woman of lovely limbs and slender waist, her whole being radiant with beauty, he was filled with desire and beside himself, enveloping that irreproachable lady in his arms, Manmatha embraced her.", "\u201cIn her distress, Anjana, faithful to her conjugal vows, cried out:\u2014", "\u2018Who desires to sever the ties of a woman devoted to her lord?\u2019", "Hearing these words, the Wind-God answered,", "\u2018I do not wish to wrong you, O Lady of Lovely Hips, let not your heart be troubled. By embracing you and entering into you you shalt bear a son endowed with strength and intelligence, of immense energy, of noble nature, possessed of vigour and courage and in agility and speed equal to myself.\u2019", "\u201cThese words pleased your mother and she gave birth to you in a cave, O Foremost of Monkeys.", "\u201cWhile still a child, you didst see the sun rise over the great forest and taking it to be a fruit sought to seize it. Bounding into the air, you didst mount up for a thousand yojanas, O Great Monkey and, though the burning rays of the sun beat upon you, you didst not falter. Seeing you rushing through space, Indra, full of wrath, hurled this thunderbolt at you, whereupon, falling, you didst fracture your left jaw on the point of a rock from which arises your name, Hanuman. Observing you in this state, Vayu the Destroyer, the Bearer of Fragrance, in the height of anger, ceased to blow throughout the Three Worlds.", "\u201cThen all the Gods were distressed on account of the calamity that has befallen the worlds and these Lords of the Universe sought to pacify the wrathful Wind-god, whereupon Pavana being placated, Brahma accorded you the boon of invulnerability in combat.", "Seeing how you didst sustain the impact of the thunderbolt, that God of a Thousand Eyes was pleased with you and also conferred an excellent boon on you, saying:\u2014", "\u2018You shalt not die till you desires to do so!

Then commissioned by the Gods, we gathered all the herbs which (when cast into the sea) produced the nectar of immortality and at that time our strength was great. Now I am old and my prowess has deserted me, but you, endowed with every virtue art amongst us. Employ your valour, O Hero, for you are most fitted to do so. Bestir thyself and cross the vast ocean, O Redoubtable Monkey; the entire monkey host is eager to behold your prowess. Arise and leap over the mighty sea, for you surpasses all beings in motion. Canst you remain indifferent to the despair of all the monkeys? Put forth your strength, as did Vishnu when traversing the Three Worlds with three strides, O Lion among Monkeys!\u201d", "Thus exhorted by the foremost of monkeys, Hanuman, renowned for his great might, the son of the Wind, assumed a form preparatory to crossing the sea that gladdened the hearts of those monkeys.", "Seeing that extremely agile leader of monkeys stretching himself in preparation for crossing the four hundred miles of sea, the monkeys, renouncing all despondency, were filled with delight and began to shout and praise the heroism of Hanuman.", "And, struck with amazement, beings from every sphere rejoiced unitedly, even as when they beheld the Lord Himself displaying his powers, when taking the three strides.", "Thus acclaimed, the mighty Hanuman expanded in size and waved his tail in pleasure, demonstrating his strength. Applauded by the older monkeys and filled with energy, he assumed an unparalleled shape, like a lion that stretches himself at the mouth of a rocky cavern, and that Son of Maruta began to yawn and the mouth of that intelligent monkey resembled a blazing brazier or a smokeless fire.", "Rising in the midst of those monkeys, his hair standing on end for joy, he paid obeisance to the older leaders and said to them:\u2014\u201cI am the son of him who shatters the mountain peaks and is the friend of fire, the mighty and incommensurable Vayu, who circulates in space, Maruta, of impetuous bounds, rapid pace and great soul. A thousand times am I able without pausing, to encircle Meru, that colossus that seems to lick the heavens. With my strong arms, churning up the sea, I can inundate the world with its mountains, rivers and lakes; with my thighs and legs, I can cause the ocean, the abode of Varuna with its great denizens, to overflow. I can encircle Vainateya, revered by all, who feeds on serpents, a thousand times while he courses once through space. What is more, I am able to reach the sun which rises in glory crowned with rays, before it sinks in the west and return without touching the earth. I can leap beyond the stars and planets, suck up the ocean and rive the earth; I can shatter the mountains with my bounds and in the immeasurable energy of my leaping I can cause the sea to overflow. When I mount into the sky, flowers from countless shrubs and trees will be borne away by me on my aerial course this day and studded with flowers my path shall resemble the Milky Way.", "\u201cAnd, O Monkeys, all beings shall behold me coursing through the air, encompassing the firmament, now rising, now descending, as it were devouring space. I shall scatter the clouds, shatter the mountains and dry up the ocean with my constant leaping. My powers are equal to the eagle\u2019s or the wind; I know of none that surpasses the King of the Birds, the Wind-god or myself. In the twinkling of an eye, I shall float through the air like lightning from a cloud. While crossing the sea, my form will resemble Vishnu\u2019s taking his three strides. My heart foretells that I shall encounter Vaidehi, therefore rejoice. Equal to Maruta in motion and Garuda in speed, I shall cover ten thousand miles; this is my firm conviction. I am able to wrest the \u2018amrita\u2019 from Indra, armed with his thunderbolt or from Brahma himself. Be assured, that having turned Lanka upside down, I shall return 1\u201d", "That monkey of immeasurable vigour roared thus, and astounded, the monkeys gazed on him with joy; and hearing those words that dissipated the distress of his kindred, that foremost of monkeys, Jambavan, transported with delight, said:\u2014\u201cO Hero! O Son of Kesarin! O Offspring of the Wind! You have dispelled the immense anxiety of your fellows, and these foremost of monkeys assembled here will perform acts tending to your welfare. By the grace of the Sages, the approval of our elders and the blessing of our spiritual preceptors do you cross the ocean. We will stand on one foot awaiting your return. On you depend the lives of all the inhabitants of the woods!\u201d", "Then that tiger of the monkeys said to those rangers of the woods:\u2014\u201cNone in this world will be able to sustain the force of my leaping. Here is the mountain Mahendra with its compact mass of rocks and high escarpments, it is from its summit that I shall spring. With its trees of varied fragrance that cover it and its many crags, it will be able to bear my weight, when I prepare to leap over four hundred miles.\u201d", "With these words that monkey, the scourge of his foes, born of Maruta, whose equal he was, scaled that monarch of mountains, carpeted with flowers of every kind and grassy swards ranged by deer, containing flowering creepers and trees laden with fruit and blossoms, frequented by lions and tigers and herds of intoxicated elephants maddened with ichor; there flocks of birds trilled and waterfalls tumbled on every side.", "Ascending that mountain, that foremost of monkeys, equal to Mahendra in power, began to wander from one crest to another and crushed between the arms of that high-souled one, that great mountain emitted a loud clamour, like a mighty elephant that has been attacked by a lion and waters gushed out from the scattered rocks and deer and elephants were seized with fear, whilst the giant trees shook.", "Its spacious uplands were deserted by the-pairs of Gandharvas engaged in drinking and dalliance, the birds flew away and the bands of Vidyadharas fled from the high plateaus; the huge serpents hid themselves in terror and the cliffs and spars broke away. With its serpents hissing, their bodies half issuing from their holes, the mountain shone, as if decorated by pennants. The Rishis in fear and agitation fled from that support of the earth so that it resembled a wayfarer in a vast forest, deserted by his companions.", "And that agile and valiant monkey, endowed with great speed, the destroyer of his foes, filled with an exalted purpose, had already reached Lanka in thought.", "End of Kishkindha Kanda.", "Then that Scourge of His Foes, Hanuman, prepared to follow the path of the Caranas in quest of the place to which Sita had been borne away by Ravana.", "Desirous of accomplishing this difficult feat without hindrance, impossible to any other, that powerful monkey, stretching out his head and neck like a bull, frightening the birds, uprooting the trees with his breast and destroying innumerable creatures, like a lion overflowing with energy joyfully bounded over the grassy slopes resembling the sea.", "On that mountain plateau, frequented by the Chiefs of the Serpent Race, embellished by blue, red, yellow, rose and various coloured metals, thronged with Celestial Beings, Yakshas, Kinneras and Gandharvas, able to change their form at will, that foremost of monkeys stood like a Naga in a lake.", "Then, having paid homage to the Sun-god, Mahendra, Pavana, Svyambhu and all beings, he prepared to set out on his journey. Turning towards the east and saluting his sire, the resourceful Hanuman, having resolved to cross the ocean to fulfil Rama\u2019s purpose, in order to reach the southern region, expanded his body under the eyes of the leaders of the monkeys, as the sea increases under the full moon.", "Assuming an immense stature, desirous of traversing the ocean, he pressed the mountain with his hands and feet and that immoveable peak shook under his weight and all the blossom from the tops of the trees fell in a shower wholly covering it with a mass of fragrant blooms.", "Under the extreme pressure of that monkey\u2019s weight, water gushed forth from the mountain like ichor from the temples of an elephant in rut. Trampled underfoot by that mighty forest dweller, the mountain let loose innumerable streams of gold, silver and collyrium and, from that rocky mass, enormous boulders detached themselves containing red arsenic so that it resembled a brazier wreathed in smoke.", "Crushed on every side by the monkey, those creatures, dwelling in the caverns, bruised and stifled, emitted strange cries and the formidable clamour created by them filled the whole earth and other regions.", "Great serpents, rearing their distinctive hoods, vomited fire and bit the rocks with their fangs and those great crags, split by the venom, broke into flames and were shivered into a thousand fragments. The medicinal herbs also, which grew there, were affected by the poison which they were unable to neutralise.", "Then the ascetics, terrified, reflecting that the mountain was being riven by great Beings, fled away, as well as the Vidya-dharas with their attendant women. Forsaking their golden seats, goblets and precious vessels with the ewers of gold in the feasting hall; abandoning the priceless sauces, wines and viands of every kind and the hides and swords with guards of Kanaka gold; intoxicated, their necks encircled with jewelled chains, adorned with garlands and red sandal paste, their eyes resembling blue lotuses, they rose into the air; and those fair Ones, wearing strings of pearls, rings and bracelets, startled, ascended smiling into the sky, close to their loved ones.", "Witnessing this great marvel, Maharishis and Vidyadharas stood in the firmament gazing down on the mountain and they heard those pure-minded ascetics saying: \u201cThis Hanuman, born of the Wind, endued with great energy, desirous of crossing the ocean, the abode of Varuna, in order to carry out Rama\u2019s purpose and that of the monkeys, is eager to reach the further shore, a most difficult feat.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the ascetics, the Vidyadharas beheld that foremost of monkeys on the mountain, bristling and quivering like a flame, emitting a great roar like the rumble of thunder. Then raising his tail which twitched convulsively, like a snake shaken by an eagle, he waved it to and fro and, lying curled across his back, it resembled a great serpent borne away by Garuda.", "And that monkey, stiffening his arms like unto two immense clubs, girded up his limbs and, crouching down, contracted his neck and arms, summoning up all his strength and courage. Scanning the path he was to take and examining the distance to be covered, he drew in his breath, pressing his two feet firmly on the ground and that elephant among monkeys, Hanuman, flattening his ears, leapt forward and, full of energy, addressed the forest dwellers, saying:", "\u201cAs an arrow loosed by Raghava flies with the speed of the wind so shall I course to Lanka which is guarded by Ravana. If I fail to find the daughter of Janaka there, I shall repair with the same speed to the region of the Gods, where, if despite mine efforts I do not recover Sita, I shall bring back the King of the Titans in chains. Either, achieving success, I shall return or uprooting Lanka from its foundation, I shall bear it hither, together with Ravana.\u201d", "With these words, Hanuman, the foremost of monkeys, without pausing for breath, deeming himself to be a second Suparna, sprang into the air and, such was the force of his leap, that the trees growing on the mountain, tossing their branches, were sent spinning on every side.", "In his rapid flight, Hanuman bore away those trees with their flowering boughs filled with lapwings intoxicated with love, into the empyrean. Carried away by the impetus of his tremendous bound, those trees followed in his wake, like relatives accompanying their dear one setting out on a journey to a far country. Uprooted by the force of his motion, Sala and other forest trees followed in Hanuman\u2019s wake, like an army its leader. Surrounded by countless trees, the crests of which were laden with blossom, the monkey Hanuman, resembling a glorious mountain, was wonderful to behold. And those great trees, full of sap, fell into the sea, as formerly the mountains in fear of Indra plunged into Varuna\u2019s abode.", "Covered with flowers of every kind, as well as young shoots and buds, that monkey shone like a cloud or a hill aglow with fireflies. Tom away by his leaping, those trees, scattering their blossom here and there, plunged into the sea, like friends who, having escorted one of their company, return. Borne away in their fragility by the wind produced by the monkey\u2019s impetuous flight, which had detached them from their stems, the multicoloured flowers fell into the sea.", "Covered with a drift: of fragrant blooms of diverse tints, that monkey, in his flight, resembled a mass of clouds embellished by lightning and the waters strewn with the blossom of his leap, looked like the firmament when the enchanting stars appear. His two arms outstretched in space, resembled two five-headed serpents issuing from the summit of a mountain.", "Sometimes that mighty monkey seemed to be drinking up the ocean with the multitudinous waves and sometimes it seemed as if he would swallow the sky itself. As he thus followed the wind\u2019s path, his eyes, shining like lightning, sparkled like two fires that have been kindled on a mountain.", "The eyes of that tawny-hued one resembled the sun and moon in juxtaposition, and his coppery nose lent his countenance the same hue as the solar orb at the approach of dusk; his uplifted tail caused that offspring of the wind to appear like the raised banner of Indra. With his coiled tail and white teeth, that exceedingly sagacious son of Anila, Hanuman, shone like the star of day encircled by a halo of rays and his plump form, of a coppery hue, caused him to resemble a mountain which is being excavated for its deposits of red ochre. Bounding over the waters, the air imprisoned in the armpits of that leonine monkey, emitted a sound like thunder.", "As in space, a meteor from a higher region rushes through the skies so did that elephant of monkeys appear or like a great bird soaring into the air or a great tusker tightly-bound by a girth, whilst the reflection of his body cast on the deep resembled a vessel foundering in a storm.", "Wherever that great monkey passed, the sea rose tumultuously under the force of his bounds and, rushing on with extreme speed, with his breast like a great prow, he caused the salty sea to surge mountainously. Pushing those high heaving billows before him, that lion among monkeys seemed to be separating heaven and earth; the waves that rose up resembled Mount Meru and Mandara and, breasted by him in his impetuous course, the waters lashed by his speed, overspread the sky like autumnal clouds. Whales, crocodiles, huge fish and turtles were uncovered in turn, like the limbs of one shedding his attire, and sea serpents, beholding that lion among monkeys travelling through space took him to be Suparna himself.", "The shadow of that great monkey, forty miles in extent and thirty wide, grew larger in the rapidity of his flight and, resembling a mass of white clouds, falling on the salty waters, looked exceedingly beautiful. That supremely illustrious and mighty monkey of vast body appeared like a winged mountain as he followed his aerial path without rest.", "Wherever that mighty elephant among the monkeys passed, the sea was instantly transformed into a fountain and, following the path of the birds, Hanuman, like the King of the feathered tribe, thrust aside the massed clouds like the Wind-god himself. Great clouds, red, blue, pale or dark, scattered by the monkey\u2019s flight, looked exceedingly beautiful and he, now entering into them, sometimes hidden sometimes visible, resembled the moon.", "Seeing that Plavaga coursing with such speed, the Gods, Gandharvas and Danavas began to rain flowers on him and, as he sailed on, the sun refrained from tormenting him and the wind ministered to him for the sake of Rama\u2019s enterprise.", "Then the Rishis praised that dweller of the woods as he was coursing through the sky and the Gods and Gandharvas extolled him in song. Seeing him bounding in space, Nagas, Yakshas and Rakshasas of various races lauded that excellent monkey and the ocean, ever solicitous for the honour of the House of Ikshvaku, reflected:\u2014\u201cIf I do not lend assistance to this Lord of Monkeys, I shall be an object of obloquy to all those gifted with speech; was I not reared by Sagara, the foremost of the race of Ikshvaku? This monkey is their counsellor, it is therefore incumbent on me not to let him perish in the waves. It behoves me to act in such wise that he may rest and, thus relieved by me, he will happily traverse the remaining way.\u201d", "In this magnanimous thought, the sea addressed that most excellent of mountains, the golden-hued Mainaka, which was covered by waves, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou have been placed here by the King of the Celestials, as a rampart against the Asuras inhabiting the nether regions. Their power is well known and, lest they rise up anew from that hell of immeasurable dimensions, you are here to prevent their escape. Nevertheless you are able to move upwards and downwards and from side to side. I command you, therefore, O Best of Mountains, to rise up. That lion among monkeys, performer of mighty exploits, engaged in Rama\u2019s service, overcome with fatigue is passing over you; you are witness of his exertions, now lift thyself up!\u201d", "Hearing the Ocean\u2019s words, the golden-breasted Mountain Mainaka with its tall trees and creepers, instantly rose from its watery bed and, as the sun with its burning rays divides the cloud, that great mountain, which the waters had concealed, on Sagara\u2019s request, exposed its golden peaks inhabited by Kinneras and great serpents, shimmering like the sun at dawn, as if it were licking the skies. The summits of that high mountain, shining like a sword, possessed the brilliance of gold and its gilded crests emitted a dazzling light lending it the lustre of a thousand suns.", "Beholding that mountain suddenly emerge before him from the middle of the sea, Hanuman reflected: \u2018This is an obstacle\u2019, and that mighty and impetuous monkey crushed that stony mass with his breast as the wind scatters the clouds; then that foremost of mountains, recognizing the power of Hanuman, shouted for joy. Thereupon, assuming the form of a man, stationing himself on his own summit, with a glad heart he addressed Hanuman saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Most Excellent of Forest Dwellers, you have undertaken an arduous task, take thine ease on my crest and continue without fatigue. The ocean king was born in the House of Raghu and, seeing you engaged on Rama\u2019s behalf, offers obeisance to you. To render service for service is the divine decree. Desirous of serving Raghu\u2019s race, he is worthy of your consideration.", "To do you honour, the Sea God adjured me thus:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Traversing a hundred yojanas through the air, this monkey is worn out by his exertions, let him rest awhile on your summit and continue his way without fatigue.\u2019", "Do you therefore remain here, O Best of Monkeys and repose thyself. Having feasted on these many sweet and fragrant fruits and roots, proceed on your course at your leisure. O Foremost of Monkeys, the sum of your virtues is well-known in the Three Worlds. O Son of the Wind, of all the Plavagas who abound in energy, I esteem you to be the chief, O Lion among Monkeys! Even an ordinary man is honoured as a guest by one conversant with his duty, how much more one such as you? You are the Son of Maruta, the Foremost of the Celestials and dost equal him in speed, O Best of Monkeys! In honouring you, who art conversant with virtue, one is honouring your sire, therefore you dost merit my reverence. Hearken, there is a further reason for this:", "\u201cIn olden times, Dear Child, the mountains, endowed with wings, began to range the four quarters with the speed of Garuda, and journeying thus, the companies of Celestials, ascetics and other Beings trembled with fear lest they should fall. Then, highly enraged, the God of a Thousand Eyes, the performer of an hundred sacrifices severed the wings of those hundreds and thousands of mountains with his thunderbolt.", "\u201cWhen, full of wrath, the Lord of the Celestials approached me, brandishing his mace, I was suddenly swept away by that high-souled Wind-god. O Foremost of Monkeys, I was thus cast into the salty waves and, retaining my wings, was preserved unhurt by thine ancestor. On account of this, you are an object of adoration to me and this is the powerful bond which unites us, O Chief of the Monkeys. The time for honouring the benefit conferred having come, it behoves you to accord this felicity to the Ocean and myself, O Illustrious One! Repose thyself therefore and accept our homage, who are worthy of your respect, O Venerable Hanuman 1 Happy am I to see you here!\u201d", "Thus accosted by Mainaka, the foremost of mountains, that excellent monkey answered, saying:\u2014\u201cI am grateful for your welcome but time presses and I have vowed not to rest on the way; day is declining, let nothing disturb your serenity.\u201d", "Then, touching the mountain with his hand, that lion among monkeys, smiling, sailed on through the air, whereupon the mountain and the ocean offered him their respect and gave him their blessings. Rising high into the sky, he looked down on the mountain and the vast ocean and proceeded unsupported in the pathvay of the wind.", "Seeing Hanuman achieve this difficult feat, the Celestial Beings and the ascetics acclaimed him; then the Gods present, in their turn, applauded the action of that golden mountain of beautiful slopes, as did Indra, the Thousand-eyed Deity also, and supremely gratified, the consort of Saci paid homage to that illustrious mountain personally, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lord of Mountains, I am extremely pleased with you! I grant you full security, proceed therefore where you desirest, O Friend. You have fearlessly offered assistance to Hanuman, who was exhausted after crossing four hundred miles of sea, despite every hazard. It is on Rama\u2019s behalf, the Son of King Dasaratha, that the monkey has undertaken this journey and you have welcomed him to the best of your power, I am well pleased with you!\u201d", "Beholding the King of the Gods, Shatakratu highly gratified, that foremost of mountains experienced supreme felicity and having received that boon from Indra, resumed its former place. Then Hanuman, in a short space, sped over the sea.", "Thereupon the Gods, Gandharvas and Siddhas with the ascetics called upon Surasa, the Mother of Serpents, who resembled the sun, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThe effulgent Son of the Wind is crossing the main, it is for you to delay him awhile Assuming the form of a terrible Rakshasi, as high as a mountain, with monstrous jaws and coppery eyes, do you reach up to the sky. We desire to test his strength and measure his fortitude to see if he is able to overcome you or if he retires discomfited.\u201d", "At these words, Surasa, having been honoured by the Gods, rose from the ocean in the form of a female demon, deformed and hideous, inspiring terror in all beings and, staying Hanuman in his flight, addressed him saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Foremost of Monkeys, you have been destined by the Lords of the World to be my food, I am about to devour you, do you enter my mouth! This boon was formerly granted to me by Dhatar.\u201d", "With these words she opened her vast mouth wide, placing herself in Maruti\u2019s path.", "Having listened to Surasa\u2019s speech, Hanuman, smiling, answered her:\u2014", "\u201cRama, the Son of Dasaratha, who retired to the Dandaka forest with Lakshmana his brother, and Vaidehi his consort, as a result of a certain exploit, became the enemy of the demons. His beloved wife, the illustrious Sita was subsequently carried away by Ravana. I have been sent to her on Rama\u2019s behalf, to whom you should proffer assistance, O You who in-habitest his dominion. Having found Maithili and rejoined Rama, whose deeds are memorable, I shall return and enter your mouth, this I promise you in good faith.\u201d", "Thus addressed by Hanuman, Surasa, who was able to change her form at will, answered:\u2014\u201cNone shall pass me alive, this is the boon I have received.\u201d Then seeing him continue on his way, the Mother of Serpents added:\u2014\u201cI have received this favour from Brahma, first enter my mouth then go your way.\u201d", "Thereafter, extending her capacious jaws, she placed herself in front of Maruti. Surasa\u2019s words incensed that lion among monkeys and he said:\u2014", "\u201cOpen your mouth wide enough to swallow me.\u201d Having said this in anger, Surasa extended her jaws to the width of forty miles and Hanuman increased his girth accordingly; thereat Surasa enlarged her mouth to fifty miles, and seeing the jaws of Surasa wide open with its long tongue, terrible to look upon, resembling a mountain, measuring fifty miles, Hanuman enlarged himself to that extent also. Then Surasa increased her mouth to sixty miles and the heroic Hanuman to seventy, whereupon Surasa widened her jaws to eighty miles, and Hanuman, resembling Fire itself, to ninety miles. Then Surasa enlarged her mouth to the extent of an hundred miles and Hanuman, reducing his body like a cloud to the size of a thumb\u2019s breadth entered into her mouth and, re-emerging from it, standing in space, addressed her saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Dakshayani, salutations to you, I have entered your mouth, now I go to seek out Vaidehi. Your boon has been honoured!\u201d", "Seeing Hanuman emerging from her mouth like the moon from the mouth of Rahu, that goddess, assuming her own form, said to the monkey:\u2014", "\u201cGo, O Best of Monkeys! Accomplish your mission. You have done well, O Friend! Now restore Sita to the magnanimous Raghava!\u201d", "Seeing this third supremely difficult feat accomplished by Hanuman, all beings extolled that monkey, crying: \u2018Excellent! Excellent!\u2019 paying obeisance to him; and he, flying into the sky, with the speed of Garuda, went on across the sea, the abode of Varuna, coursing through the air which was filled with clouds, where birds ranged and which was frequented by Vidyadharas and shining vehicles drawn by lions, elephants, tigers and winged serpents. And Maruti, scattering the clouds like the wind itself, sailed on like Garuda through that firmament, which was illumined by flashes of lightning, resembling the five fires, inhabited by beings, who, by their merits had conquered heaven, occupied by the Deity of Fire bearing the sacrificial oblations. Adorned by the constellations of planets, the sun, the moon and hosts of stars; thronged with Maharishis, Gandharvas, Nagas and Yakshas; pure, stainless, immense; inhabited by Vishvavasu; trodden by the elephant of the King of the Gods, that orbit of the sun and the moon, the canopy of the world, stretched by Brahma over the earth, was visited by countless heroes and aerial beings.", "Mighty clouds, shining with the tints of Kalaguru, red, yellow and black, sparkled with brilliance as they w\u2019ere dispelled by Hanuman and he, penetrating those cloudy battlements, emerged once more as the moon in the rainy season disappears and re-appears in the clouds. Everywhere the son of Maruta could be seen cleaving the air like the King of the Mountains furnished with wings.", "Seeing him sailing through space, a female demon of immense size, named Singhika, who was able to change her form at will, said to herself:\u2014", "\u2018To-day, after a long time, I shall be able to satisfy my hunger! That great creature has appeared in answer to my wish!\u2019", "Reflecting thus in her heart, she seized Hanuman\u2019s shadow, and he, feeling it held fast, thought:", "\u2018My power has suddenly been dissipated like a mighty barque which is retarded in its course by an adverse wind!\u2019", "Then looking round on every side, Hanuman perceived that immense being rising from the salty waves.", "Seeing that monster, the Son of the Wind-god, reflected:\u2014", "\u2018This is without doubt that creature of wonderful form, possessed of exceeding power, given to securing its prey by means of their shadow, who was, desmbed to me by the monkey king.\u2019", "Concluding by her action that it was Singhika, that sagacious monkey expanded his frame to gigantic proportions so that he resembled a mass of cloud during the rains.", "When the demon saw the enlarged body of that mighty monkey, she extended her jaws so that they resembled the sky and the nether regions and, roaring like thunder, hurled herself upon him, but marking the proportions of her mouth and the vulnerable parts of her body, that intelligent monkey, hard as a diamond, contracting his limbs, threw himself into her jaws.", "And the Siddhas and Caranas beheld him diving into her mouth, disappearing like the moon devoured by Rahu at the time of eclipse. And Hanuman, with his sharp nails tore the entrails of that demon and, with the rapidity of thought, emerged, having slain her by his acuteness, endurance and skill and, having overthrown her, began to expand once more. Thereafter that hero among monkeys suddenly regained his power, whilst Singhika, deprived of life by him, torn asunder, sank into the waves, Svyambhu having created him for her destruction.", "Perceiving Singhika speedily overcome by him, all the beings who range the skies addressed that foremost of monkeys saying: \u201cTremendous is this deed that you have performed this day! Mighty was this monster whom you have slain. O Illustrious Monkey, now pursue the purpose dear to thine heart without hindrance. He, who like you, possesses the four attributes: fixity of purpose, circumspection, wisdom and ability, does not fail in his enterprise O Indra among Monkeys!\u201d", "Honoured by those whose wishes are fulfilled, as he merited to be, that monkey flew into the sky like Garuda, the devourer of serpents. Then, having reached the further shore, Hanuman looking round on every side, observed countless woods a hundred miles distant and, as he went on, that leader of forest dwellers saw an island adorned with trees of various kinds and thickets belonging to the Malaya mountains; and he surveyed the sea and the lands bordering it and the trees growing on its shores as also the mouths of the ocean\u2019s consorts.", "Gazing down on his own body which resembled a great cloud covering the sky that self-contained monkey reflected: \u201cObserving mine immense stature and the rapidity of my flight the demons will be seized with curiosity concerning me.\u201d", "Thinking thus, in his great prudence, he contracted his body, which was the size of a mountain and assumed his ordinary form as one whose wits have been scattered resumes his normal state. Abandoning his gigantic dimensions, he took on his native form, as did Vishnu, the depriver of Bali\u2019s power, when he made the three strides.", "Constantly mindful of his mission, Hanuman, who was able to assume various graceful forms, having crossed the sea, a feat not to be accomplished by any other, reduced his body to its former size.", "Thereafter that high-souled One, resembling a cloudy pavilion, alighted on the summit of the glorious mountain Samva, of many splendid peaks which was covered with Ketaka, Uddalaka and Narikela trees.", "Reaching the shore of the sea, the monkey beholding Lanka on the top of the foremost of mountains, descended, having assumed his native form, causing agitation among the deer and birds.", "Through his valour having traversed the ocean heaving with waves and abounding in Danavas and Pannagas, Hanuman, alighting on the further shore, beheld Lanka which resembled the city of Amaravati.", "Having crossed the unconquerable sea, that mighty monkey, standing on the summit of the Trikuta Mountain, surveyed Lanka and that ape endowed with great prowess was covered by a shower of blossom that fell from the trees on every side, nor did that fortunate monkey, who had just traversed many hundreds of miles of sea without pausing for breath, experience any fatigue.", "\u2018I am able to journey many hundreds of miles, what then is this ocean measuring four hundred miles only?\u2019", "Thus thinking, that foremost of monkeys, endowed with great energy, turned quickly towards Lanka, having crossed the mighty ocean and he passed between green fields and dense thickets fragrant with the scent of honey and traversed the mountainous district covered with trees and blossoming woods. Stationing himself there, the Son of the Wind-god beheld forests and groves and Lanka itself perched on the summit of the mountain.", "Sarala, Kamikara, Khar jura trees in full flower with the balmy Priyala, Muchulinda, Kutaja, Ketaka and Priyangu trees heavy with scent; Nipa, Saptaccada, Asana, Kovidara and Karavira trees laden with buds and flowers, whose crests, waving in the wind abounded with birds, were seen by him and ponds filled with swans and waterfowl and carpeted with white and blue lotuses; flower gardens with ornamental fountains and marvellous parks planted with every kind of tree which yielded fruit and flowers in every season.", "Drawing nearer to Lanka, which was protected by Ravana, surrounded by a moat embellished with blue and white lotuses, the auspicious Hanuman noted that a strong guard had been placed round it since Sita\u2019s abduction; and demons with formidable bows ranged it on every side and that great and marvellous city was encircled by a golden wall, its buildings as high as mountains, resembling autumn clouds.", "The main highways were lined with tall white buildings with hundreds of turrets decorated with flying pennants and banners. Most wonderful, with its golden archways festooned with climbing plants, the city of Lanka appeared to Hanuman to be like the city of the Gods. Built on the summit of a mountain, with its palaces of dazzling white, it resembled an aerial city. Constructed by Vishvakarma and ruled by the Lord of the Titans himself, it seemed to that monkey to be suspended in the sky with its ramparts as the thighs, the stretches of water and woods, the raiment, Shataghnis and spears the hair, the terraces the diadem, Lanka resembled a woman, a creation of Vishvakarma\u2019s thought.", "Reaching the northern gate resembling Mount Kailasha, which seemed to cleave the skies and support the firmament with its splendid lofty towers and, observing that city thronged with ferocious titans, like a cavern full of venomous snakes, protected by the ocean and, recollecting that terrible adversary, Ravana, the monkey reflected:\u2014", "\u2018Even should the mighty armed Raghava succeed in reaching this dread and impregnable city protected by Ravana, what could he do? It is not possible to enter into negotiations with these demons nor could one win them over by bribes nor succeed in sowing dissension among them nor overcome them in fight. Among the monkeys, only four have power to reach this place\u2014Bali\u2019s son, Nila, the sagacious Sugriva, and I. But first let me ascertain if Vaidehi still lives or no; after seeing Janaka\u2019s daughter, I shall consider these matters further.\u2019", "Then that elephant among monkeys, stationed on the summit of the mountain, bethought himself how he could discover Sita, the delight of Rama.", "\u2018In this shape I shall not be able to enter the city guarded by valiant and ferocious demons nor outwit those warriors full of courage, energy and prowess. In order to find Janaki, I must enter the city by night at a favourable moment, in a form which will not attract attention so that I may carry through this great enterprise.\u2019", "Beholding that city, inaccessible even to the Gods and Asuras, Hanuman, sighing deeply, reflected within himself:", "\u2018How can I succeed in finding Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, without being discovered by the perfidious Ravana, Lord of the Demons? How may the work of Rama, who is cognisant of the Self, not be brought to nought? How may I see the daughter of Janaka alone and in secret? Undertakings fail in the face of hindrances raised by time and place or through the fault of an incompetent messenger, as darkness is dispelled by the rising sun. When it concerns that which should be undertaken or avoided, the best laid plans may come to nought through the heedlessness of a messenger nor do they appear in all their splendour; a presumptuous messenger may spoil all!", "\u2018How shall I act so that there shall be no incompetence on my part? How may my crossing of the ocean bear fruit? If I am discovered by the demons, the project which the sagacious Rama has formed, who desires the destruction of Ravana, will miscarry. Even if I assume the form of a demon I cannot remain here long without being discovered by them, how much less in some other shape. Even the wind is not able to circulate here unrecognized, I deem. Nothing escapes the vigilance of these formidable titans. If I remain here in my native form, I shall be courting disaster and the purpose of my master will be frustrated, therefore, reducing my size, I shall enter Lanka as a monkey in order to carry through Rama\u2019s design. Entering this inaccessible city by night, I shall penetrate into every dwelling in order to find Janaka\u2019s daughter.\u2019", "Having thus resolved, Hanuman, eager to find Vaidehi, waited for the sun to set.", "When the day\u2019s orb had sunk behind the Asta Mountain, Maruti reduced his body to the size of a cat, extraordinary to behold and, in the dusk, the mighty Hanuman, springing up, entered that marvellous city traversed by wide streets with rows of houses adorned with golden pillars and balconies, which lent it the appearance of a city of the Gandharvas.", "Then he beheld that capital containing seven and eight storied buildings with marble floors inlaid with golden mosaic and golden archways, lending it a great brilliance and, seeing the unimaginable splendour of Lanka, in his eagerness to find Vaidehi, he experienced both sadness and delight.", "With its garlands of palaces rivalling each other in whiteness and the arches interlaced with gold of great price, that magnificent city protected by Ravana was encircled by intrepid warriors of great prowess.", "And the moon at its full with its flocks of stars seemed to be ministering to Hanuman and, with its myriad rays, filled the worlds with its light. Then that hero among monkeys gazed on the moon shining like a conch-shell, white as milk or a lotus stalk that, floating all luminous in space, resembled a swan swimming on a lake.", "Having rested on Mount Samva of lofty summits, that resembled a great cloud, Hanuman, the son of Maruta, that lion among monkeys, confident of his own strength, entered Lanka by night, with its wealth of ravishing groves and waters, guarded by Ravana; that enchanting city with its dazzling palaces resembling autumn clouds, where the sound of the sea could be heard, the breezes of which it inhaled day and night.", "Prosperous, surrounded by great forces, resembling Vitapavati with its white gates and decorated arches, protected by infuriated elephants, splendid as Bhogavati filled with huge serpents, similar to the city of Indra, embellished by hosts of stars, resounding to the clamour of blustering winds, encircled by a golden rampart, re-echoing to the pealing of innumerable bells and adorned with banners, that city\u2019 was approached by Hanuman in exaltation, his heart full of wonder.", "And he surveyed it on every side, with its golden gates, the lintels of emerald and the pavements studded with pearls, crystal and gems; with its steps inlaid with precious stones, and floors of lapis lazuli, the grilles of refined gold and parapets of silver; the stairways of crystal that, free from dust, were possessed of emerald treads. And there were charming rooms, which, on account of their elegance, seemed to be built in the air.", "The cries of curlews and peacocks could be heard and geese frequented that place whilst swans floated majestically on the lakes; everywhere the sound of the beating of drums and the tinkling of ornaments resounded and, beholding Lanka that resembled Vasvakara and seemed to be built in space, the monkey was filled with rapture.", "Gazing on that splendid city belonging to the Lord of the Titans, that no other surpassed in opulence, the sagacious Hanuman reflected:\u2014", "\u2018This capital, protected by Ravana\u2019s warriors is not to be subdued by force and is only accessible to Kumuda, Angada and that mighty monkey, Sushena or Mainda and Dvivida or the offspring of Vivasvata or the monkey Kushaparva or Rikshya, that foremost of monkeys, or myself.\u2019", "Thereafter, recollecting the valour of the long-armed Raghava and the prowess of Lakshmana, the confidence of that monkey was restored.", "And that mighty monkey surveyed Lanka, the capital of the Lord of the Titans, that had the sea as her raiment, cow sheds and stables for her pendants, the armouries her breasts, decked out like a woman, where darkness was dispelled by the bright light of torches and the gleaming of the stars.", "And as that tiger among monkeys, son of the great Wind-god, entered the city, the Deity who presided over the capital protected by Ravana, she of monstrous aspect, rose up and barred the way of that heroic son of Vayu. Emitting a great roar, she challenged the offspring of the Wind-god, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Dweller of the Forest, who art you and for what purpose hast you come hither? Answer truthfully if you dost value your life! Under no pretext will you be able to obtain entry into this Lanka protected by the forces of Ravana, which patrol it on every side.\u201d", "Then the valiant Hanuman answered her, who stood before him, saying:\u2014\u201cI shall tell you all about that on which you questioneth me anon but say first who you are in this hideous form and why you dost admonish me in anger, O Irascible One.\u201d", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s words, the Goddess of Lanka, able to change her shape at will, waxed wrath and in harsh tones addressed the son of the Wind-god, saying:\u2014", "\u201cObedient to the mandate of the magnanimous Ravana, the King of the Titans, I guard the city. None may pass me, yet if any should contrive to enter here, he will soon fall under my blows, deprived of his life breaths. I am the city of Lanka itself, and whatever betide I shall remain true to the words I have uttered!\u201d", "Hanuman, born of Maruta, the foremost of monkeys, stood motionless like a rock and beholding her in the form of a woman, that lion among monkeys, endowed with intelligence and courage, spoke to her thus:\u2014", "\u201cI wish to behold this city with its turrets, walls and arches, and have come hither for this purpose. Great is my desire to see it and explore its woods, groves and gardens, as also its great buildings.\u201d", "Hearing these words, the presiding Deity of Lanka, who was able to change her form at will, was still further provoked and answered in anger:\u2014", "\u201cO Insensate One, O Last of the Monkeys 1 without overcoming me, you canst not behold this city to-day, which is ruled over by the King of the Titans.\u201d", "Then that Hon among forest dwellers replied to that female ranger of the night, saying:\u2014\u201cAfter viewing the city, O Auspicious One, I shall return from whence I came.\u201d", "On this, Lanka emitted a terrible cry and struck that excellent monkey with the palm of her hand. Under the force of her blow, the valiant Son of Maruta let out a roar and closing the fingers of his left hand, pushed her away with his fist. Reflecting \u2018She is a woman\u2019 he controlled his anger, nevertheless the demon fell to the ground instantly, her face distorted and, seeing her lying on the earth, Hanuman, who was full of courage and nobflity, had compassion on her, she being but a woman.", "Thereupon, Lanka, exceedingly agitated, addressed that monkey in low and faltering accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Mighty-armed One, have pity on me 1 Spare me, O Best of Monkeys! Those endowed with strength and prowess, stay their hand betimes! O You of great might, you have overcome me by your valour!", "Hear the following truth from me which was proclaimed by Swyambhu who prophesied saying:", "\u2018In the hour that a monkey overcomes you by force, the titans will cease to be invincible.\u2019", "\u201cThat time, fixed by Swyambhu has come, as is shown by your presence here to-day! The truth ordained by the Self-create is unalterable. The destruction of the unrighteous King Ravana together with all the titans is imminent, in consequence of the abduction of Sita. Therefore, O Best of Monkeys, do you enter this city, which is protected by Ravana, and accomplish all you desirest. Entering this splendid city, protected by the Lord of the Titans, which is doomed, go about freely wheresoever you will, in search of the chaste daughter of Janaka.\u201d", "By his valour, the mighty Hanuman, foremost of monkeys, having triumphed over Lanka, that splendid city, able to change her form at will, without passing through the gate, leapt over the wall and, by night, penetrated into the centre of the capital.", "Hanuman, faithful to the interests of the King of the Monkeys, having found his way into that city, thus placed his left foot on the heads of his foes; and that excellent son of Maruta, entering by night, proceeded along the royal highway strewn with flowers and continued to advance through that enchanting capital where the sound of musical instruments blended with laughter.", "That magnificent city with its innumerable dwellings bearing the mark of the mace and the goad, with windows of diamond, resembled the sky adorned with clouds. Lanka belonging to the titans, with its opulent mansions like white clouds, adorned with lotuses and svastikas, hung with garlands, highly decorated, was viewed by Hanuman with delight, who ranged it on Rama\u2019s behalf and in the interests of Sugriva.", "That illustrious monkey passing from house to house, observed the many dwellings of varying forms, on every side and listened to the melodious chanting in triple modulation, of women sick with love, who resembled celestial nymphs. He heard the tinkling of their girdles and the clashing of their anklets, as they ascended the stairways of those dwellings belonging to the great Ones, and here and there the sound of clapping of hands and the clicking of castanets. He heard also the intoning of sacred formulas in the dwellings of the titans and the recitation of those occupied in the study of the Veda.", "He also saw titans who were singing the praises of Ravana in a loud voice, a great company of them being stationed on the royal highway which they obstructed; and he observed a large concourse of spies in the central courtyard, who had been initiated, some with matted locks, some shaven, some wearing deer-skins and some stark naked, bearing handfuls of darbha grass, braziers, picks, clubs and staves, and others in rags, who had only a single eye or ear or breast which twitched; and some were dwarfs, hideous to behold; and there were bowmen, swordsmen and warriors bearing clubs and iron bars or effulgent in curious armour; some were neither exceedingly fat nor too lean nor unduly tall nor short nor extremely fair nor dark nor humpbacked nor dwarfed; some were deformed, some handsome, some distinguished and there were also standard bearers and some who carried flags and every kind of weapon.", "And Hanuman observed that some were armed with spears, darts, harpoons, arrows, slings and other weapons and many ranging about at will wore garlands and were daubed with paste, sprinkled with perfume, clothed in rich stuffs and adorned with magnificent jewels; some of these mighty warriors were furnished with javelins and maces and hundreds and thousands of them were garrisoned in the central courtyard, engaged in guarding the private apartments with vigilance by order of their king.", "And he saw the famous palace of the Lord of the Titans, built on the summit of the mountain, with golden arched gateways, surrounded by a moat, embellished with pale lotuses and completely encircled by a rampart, resembling heaven itself; and it was marvellous, resonant with pleasant sounds and filled with the neighing of superb steeds and well-bred beasts and the noise of chariots and elephants; and there were four tusked elephants resembling great clouds and many herds of deer.", "Then the monkey entered that palace protected by the Titan King, guarded by thousands of mighty Yatudhanas, the portals of which were richly decorated with beasts and birds and he penetrated to the inner apartment encircled with walls of Hema and Jambunada gold, its ceilings adorned with pearls and gems of great price and pervaded by the fragrance of aloe and sandalwood.", "Then the fortunate Hanuman beheld that brilliant orb of the night in the midst of the stars covering all beings with its light, like a bull inflamed with desire in the midst of a herd of cows, and that heroic monkey gazed on that moon, floating in the sky, white as the sheen of a conch or a lotus stalk, that star of cooling rays which destroys the sorrows of the world, draws up the tides and sheds its light on all beings. That brightness which shines on the summit of Mount Mandara and at dusk sparkles on the sea, as well as on the lotuses of the lakes, now blazed from the face of that nocturnal planet.", "Like a swan on its silvery nest or a lion in a cave of the Mandara Mountain or a warrior on a proud elephant so was the splendour of the moon in the heavens. Like a humpbacked buffalo with pointed horns or the lofty Mountain Shveta with its high peaks or an elephant with gold-encircled tusks, so did the moon appear with its clearly defined prominence.", "Just as the great orb of the sun dissolves the ice and frost on muddy pools so was darkness dispelled by the brilliance of the auspicious moon, whose symbol is the hare, so that even the dark patches on its surface appeared bright. Like the King of Beasts issuing from his cave or the lord of elephants entering the deep woods or a sovereign of men ranging his dominions so did the moon appear in its full splendour.", "The brightness of its rising had dispelled the night, accentuating the swarthiness of the titans, those eaters of flesh, and awakening thoughts of love in the lover.", "Women, whose melodious voices had charmed the ear, having disported themselves, now slept in the arms of their lords, whilst titans of strange and terrible deeds went forth marauding.", "And the sagacious Hanuman beheld mansions where intoxication and folly reigned, where chariots, horses and golden seats were seen everywhere in luxurious and warlike abundance.", "He beheld titans in violent debate, raising their great arms, discoursing wildly, railing at each other and exchanging acrimonious words; and some were striking their breasts and brandishing great bows, whilst others adjusted their attire or embraced their consorts.", "And Hanuman observed courtesans performing their toilet, whilst others slept and incomparably lovely women laughing or frowning in anger. Here gigantic elephants trumpeted, there worship was being performed, whilst warriors were uttering threats, so that the city resembled a lake filled with angry serpents.", "And he beheld in that place, persons full of intelligence, able debators, pious men, leaders of fashion and observers of ritual, and beholding those magnificent beings, endowed with every attribute in accord with their nature, Hanuman was delighted; such was their splendour, that even those who were ugly, appeared fair.", "And he saw their consorts, full of nobility and of great beauty, worthy of adornment, like unto stars in the excellence of their conduct, who were filled with affection for their protectors, some casting tender glances, others exchanging tokens and some drinking.", "And by night, Hanuman observed lovely women being embraced by their paramours, affecting modesty or passion, like birds sporting with their mates, whilst others, in their homes, lay peacefully on the breasts of their lords, full of tenderness, and faithful to their conjugal duty.", "Some, lying without raiment, deserted by their lovers, had the radiance of gold and were marvellously beautiful with their golden skins, graceful limbs and complexions like the moonlight.", "And Hanuman saw other women in their homes experiencing the height of joy with their lords, full of delight, decked with flowers, charming the hearts of their consorts with their beauty. These lovely women of radiant countenance, resembling the moon, possessing marvellous eyes with sweeping lashes and slanting lids and adorned with innumerable jewels, seemed to Hanuman to resemble flashes of lightning.", "But of the nobly-born Sita, offspring of a royal House, fixed in the path of virtue, resembling a delicate flowering creeper or the frail Sadhujata plant, sprung from the mind of Brahma Himself, he could find no trace. Sita, established in the path of chastity, her gaze ever fixed on Rama, ever absorbed in his contemplation, his very mind and heart itself, exalted above all women, a prey to burning grief, her bosom wet with tears, she who was formerly adorned with priceless ornaments, Sita with her charming lashes and enchanting throat, resembling a blue-necked peahen disporting itself in the woods, or the blurred outline of the moon or a golden ingot covered with dust or a scar left by a wound or a golden arrow snapped by the wind.", "And that monkey, after his long search, not finding Sita, consort of that lord of men, Rama, the foremost of those skilled in speech, was overcome with grief and bereft of all courage.", "Wandering here and there at will on the roofs of the houses, that monkey, able to assume any form he chose, ranged the city of Lanka, and that auspicious one came to the abode of that Lord of the Titans, encircled by a shining wall, sparkling like the sun and guarded by terrible demons, as is a mighty forest by lions.", "And that foremost of monkeys beheld that marvellous palace with its fretted archways, inlaid with silver and embellished with gold, abounding in splendid courts and gateways, filled with the drivers of elephants and indomitable warriors, irresistibly swift horses harnessed to chariots and curious waggons, covered with lion and tiger skins, that were embossed with images of gold and silver and hung with jingling bells.", "Strewn with precious stones and furnished with rich seats, this was the favourite haunt of the Maharathas and their meeting place. Rare deer and birds of every species and variety abounded here, whilst disciplined sentries protected it. Everywhere noble and distinguished women could be seen and the palace was filled with the tinkling of their ornaments; there the foremost of the titans dwelt and it was decorated with royal symbols and fragrant with sandalwood. Crowded with great beings, like a forest filled with lions, resounding to the beating of gongs, tambourines and the blare of conches, it was also the place of worship of the titans, where offerings were made at the times of the moon\u2019s change; sometimes, in fear of Ravana, silent as the sea and sometimes resounding like the waves, that vast abode belonging to the mighty Ravana was strewn with precious gems, and that great monkey beheld it blazing in. splendour and filled with elephants, horses and chariots.", "\u2018It is the jewel of Lanka\u2019 reflected that illustrious monkey, Hanuman, wandering about the outskirts of the palace and he began to range the dwellings of the titans and their gardens, and he bounded into the abode of Prahasta and then plunged courageously into the palace of Mahaparshva; thereafter, that mighty monkey entered the residence of Kumbhakarna which resembled a mass of clouds and also that of Bibishana; then in turn he visited the dwellings of Mahodara, Virupaksha, Vidyujjibha and Vidyunmala and with a bound he entered the house of Vahudanshtra and that of Suka and the intelligent Sarana. Then the mansions of Indrajit, Jambumala and Sumala were explored by that foremost of monkeys and thereafter he passed on to the abodes of Rashmiketu, Suryasacu and Vajrakaya; and next the offspring of the Wind-god searched the habitations of Dhumraksha, Sampati, the grim Vidyudruna, Phana, Vighana and Sukanabha, Shakra, Shatha, Kapatha, Hrasvakarna, Danshtra and the demon Lomasa, Yudhyonmatta, Matta and the horseman, Dhvajagriva, Sadin, Vidyujjibha and Vijibha, as also that of Hastimukha and of Karala, Vishala and Sonitaksha. The illustrious Son of Maruta then searched the dwellings of other prosperous titans one after the other, marking their affluence.", "And having searched all the residences belonging to those titans in every way, that fortunate monkey approached the palace of the king. Then the foremost of monkeys observed demon women of menacing looks, prowling outside the apartments where Ravana slept, bearing darts and maces in their hands and equipped with spears and clubs and he beheld innumerable bands of them in the abode of the titan king and gigantic demons brandishing weapons of every kind. He beheld steeds of exceeding swiftness, red, white and black and wonderfully bred elephants, vanquishers of hostile tuskers, trained for every suitable purpose and equal to Airavata himself in conflict and these elephants, the destroyers of hostile armies resembled scurrying clouds or moving hills and their trumpeting was like the crash of thunder.", "Then that monkey, the son of the Wind-god, beheld thousands of the titan host in that palace and cars of gold and glittering mail which shone like the rising sun; he saw also many litters of different shapes, and bowers, picture galleries, gymnasiums, mountains constructed of wood, pavilions and entertainment halls. And in that palace belonging to Ravana, was a charming edifice as beautiful as the Mandara Mountain and pens for peacocks and banners and flagpoles. Heaps of jewels lay about and a great accumulation of treasure had been brought there by the exploits of those valiant titans so that it resembled the palace of Kuvera. On account of the lustre of those gems and the resplendence of Ravana himself, that palace glittered like the sun with its myriad rays.", "And that monkey chief beheld couches and seats of gold, and vessels wrought with pearls overflowing with wines,1 and the dimensions and magnificence of that place caused it to resemble the mansion of Kama or the abode of Kuvera, and that palace resounded with the tinkling of anklets and girdles, with drums and cymbals and other musical instruments and was thronged with women as lovely as pearls and surrounded by great ramparts.", "Then that mighty monkey continued to explore those dwellings fitted with golden windows, studded with emeralds, resembling a mass of clouds in the rainy season rent by lightning and traversed by flocks of cranes. And he beheld various halls and buildings stored with conches, bows and weapons of war, furnished with turrets as high as hills, and these mansions, containing treasure of every kind were held in regard by both Gods and titans and were flawless and constructed by Ravana by his own power.", "Hanuman having scoured the mansions of that Lord of Lanka meticulously furnished with every comfort as if Maya had created them, thereafter visited the palace of that King of Rakshasas himself, which surpassed all others and resembled a mass of towering clouds. Of incomparable loveliness, it seemed as if heaven itself had descended on earth and its beauty was dazzling. Teeming with innumerable gems, trees of every kind covered it with flowers like the summit of a mountain on which snow has fallen; beautiful women served as its ornaments and it shone like a cloud riven by lightning; such was its splendour that it resembled a marvellous chariot drawn through the skies by ravishing swans.", "Like the peak of a mountain rich in ore or the firmament adorned by the moon and stars or like clouds of many hues, it glistened with innumerable gems. Artificial rocks made of clay, resembling mountain ranges, planted with counterfeit trees laden with heaps of flowers, fashioned with stamens and leaves could be seen there and improvised dwellings, dazzlingly white, with pools covered with flowering lotuses possessing golden stamens, and diverse groves and ravishing fountains.", "The monkey gazed on the vast aerial chariot named Pushpaka, which, gleaming like pearl, planed above the highest buildings and contained birds made of emerald, silver and coral and serpents marvellously fashioned of various metals and life-sized horses and birds with charming beaks and wonderful wings which contracted and expanded, their plumage like that of Kama himself, posed on gold and coral flowers; and there were elephants with tapering trunks, bearing lotus leaves, engaged in showering water on the Goddess Lakshmi, who, seated in a pool, held lotuses in her fair hands.", "Such was the marvellous creation which met the astonished monkey\u2019s gaze, which resembled a mountain of charming caverns or a tree from whose hollows delicious fragrance escapes in the springtime.", "Yet that monkey searching that exalted city, protected by the ten-headed Ravana, was unable to find the daughter of Janaka, so highly regarded and deeply afflicted and who had been conquered by the virtue and valour of her lord. And not finding Janaka\u2019s daughter, despite his investigations and the vigilance of his search, the illustrious Hanuman, who was virtuous and generous of soul, felt a burning anguish take possession of his heart.", "Halting there, the intelligent monkey, born of Pavana, regarded that splendid chariot encrusted with gold and gems more carefully. Fashioned of plated gold, embellished with lovely images, regarded by Vishvakarma himself as an incomparable artistic achievement, travelling in space like a guiding light in the orbit of the sun, it was immeasurably resplendent. No detail of that car had been executed unskilfully, no ornament but appeared to be a jewel of great price nor was there anything surpassed by the chariots of the Gods, every part being excellently wrought.", "By the merit of his asceticism and contemplation Ravana had obtained it and it repaired wheresoever its master directed it by the power of his thought. Irresistible and swift as the wind, a source of happiness to those magnanimous beings given to pious deeds, who had reached the peak of prosperity and glory, capable of ranging the firmament, containing many apartments and furnished with innumerable works of art, captivating to the mind, stainless as the autumnal moon, resembling a mountain with splendid peaks, borne by thousands of demons whose cheeks were graced with earrings, voracious eaters, of large unwinking eyes, who travelled through space with exceeding velocity day and night, that aerial chariot, Pushpaka, splendid to look upon, covered with flowers, fairer than spring itself, drew the gaze of that Prince of Monkey Warriors.", "Within these precincts, a magnificent building, remarkable for its spaciousness and splendour, arrested the attention of Hanuman, the son of Maruta; it was two miles in width, four in length and belonged to the King of the Titans himself.", "And Hanuman, the slayer of his foes, ranging here and there in search of the Princess of Videha, the large-eyed Sita, beheld that goodly residence where the titans dwelt together and he approached the palace of the king, surrounded by three and four tusked elephants and guarded in its entire length by warriors bearing weapons in their hands. He beheld that dwelling, thronged with titan women, consorts of Ravana, and also the daughters of kings who had been forcibly carried away by him, which resembled an ocean teeming with crocodiles, sharks, whales, enormous fish and serpents, agitated by the force of the tempest. And the splendour of the abode of Vaish-ravana, Candra and Harivahana was reflected in Ravana\u2019s palace, a splendour that was unequalled and changeless and the prosperity of the residences of Kuvera, Yama and Varuna were rivalled, nay surpassed, by that of the titan\u2019s abode.", "In the centre of that palace, the offspring of the wind, saw yet another edifice, well constructed and furnished with innumerable grilles. Formerly created in heaven at Brahma\u2019s wish by Vishvakarma, that noble car embellished with gems was called Pushpaka, which Kuvera had acquired by prolonged austerities and of which the King of the Titans, having vanquished him by his might, took possession. And that mighty monkey ascended that splendid car, containing figures of wolves made of Kartasvara and Hiranya gold and adorned with slender pillars of dazzling splendour, furnished with private rooms and gleaming pavilions, resembling the Meru and Mandara Mountains, licking the skies and blazing like the sun.", "This masterpiece of Vishvakarma had many golden stairways and a superb and marvellous ceiling; it contained balconies and galleries of deep blue sapphire and other precious gems; the floors were encrusted with rare pearls which rendered it blindingly beautiful; built of red sandalwood and shining like pure gold, it resembled the rising sun and subtle perfumes rose therefrom.", "That mighty monkey, stationed there, smelt the rich odour of wines and viands which rose on every side, and those ambrosial and penetrating fumes seemed to him to be the embodiment of Anila herself and were inhaled by him as coming from an intimate friend, and that aroma seemed to say to Hanuman \u201cCome hither where Ravana is to be found\u201d, and he proceeded further and beheld a vast and glorious hall.", "Now that spacious apartment was very dear to Ravana, who looked on it as a greatly cherished woman and its jewelled stairways and galleries of pure gold gave it a dazzling appearance, the floors being of crystal with inlay of ivory, pearl, diamond, coral, silver and gold. It was adorned with many jewelled pilasters, which were symetrical, straight, elegant and inlaid with exceeding artistry and it was supported by tall pillars of equal size resembling wings so that the building seemed to be flying in the air and the floor was covered by a carpet, wide and four-cornered like the earth and patterned as with varied countries, kingdoms and dwellings, and there the song of birds could be heard and it was pervaded by a celestial fragrance.", "Hung with rich tapestries, darkened by incense fumes, spotless and pure as a swan, garlanded with leaves and flowers lending it the resemblance of Kamadhenu, bringing delight to the heart, colour to the cheek, giving birth to prosperity and banishing all sorrow, the apartments of the King of the Titans gratified every sense, as if it were a mother.", "Entering that abode protected by Ravana, Hanuman asked himself: \u201cCan this be paradise or the region of the Gods or Indra\u2019s capital or the state of supreme bliss?\u201d and he examined the golden lamps, which resembled gamblers absorbed in their dice, who, defeated by their opponents, are plunged in thought, and Hanuman perceived that the brilliance of the lamps and the lustre of Ravana and the splendour of the decorations, illumined the appartment.", "He beheld innumerable women, lying on the rugs, attired in every kind of raiment with wreaths on their heads, who, under the influence of wine, had fallen asleep, having ceased to disport themselves, half the night being spent. And, on account of the silence, that great company, decked with ornaments, the tinkling of which was no longer audible, resembled a vast lake filled with lotuses where the sound of the swans and the humming of bees has ceased.", "Maruti gazed on the faces of those lovely women with eyes and mouths shut fast, emitting a flower-like fragrance and they resembled lotuses that, folding their petals at evening, wait for the dawn to open them once more or like water lilies which the bees, intoxicated with love, visit continually. With just cause did that noble and mighty monkey compare them to nymphoeae, for the harem was bright with their radiance, as the starry heavens on a serene autumnal night and, in their midst, the King of the Titans blazed like a fair moon, encircled by attendant stars.", "Then that monkey said to himself: \u201cThose planets that have fallen from the firmament, their merit exhausted, are all re-united here\u201d, and in sooth, those women in their grace, beauty and magnificence shone like dazzling meteors.", "Some lay wrapped in slumber into which they had fallen in the midst of dancing and feasting, their hair and crowns in disarray, their ornaments scattered here and there; others amongst those lovely beings had lost their anklets and the tilaka mark on their foreheads had been effaced; some had allowed their garlands to fall aside, some had broken their pearls and, their raiment in disorder, their girdles loosened, resembled disburdened mules, whilst others, bereft of earrings, their garlands torn and crushed, looked like flowering creepers trodden under foot by great elephants in the forest.", "Sometimes the loosened pearls, like the scintillating rays of the moon, lay between the women\u2019s breasts like sleeping swans, whilst chains of emerald resembled drakes or those of gold looked like Cakravata birds. And those women were like unto rivers, their thighs being the banks, where swans, geese and other waterfowl disport themselves or, sleeping, resembled streams, the golden bells on their girdles, the ripples, their faces, the lotuses, their amorous desires, the crocodiles, their grace, the banks.", "On their tender limbs the marks of the ornaments looked like bees, whilst the veils of others, rising and falling with their breath, fluttered gracefully before their faces like bright streamers of many-coloured yarn and the earrings of others vibrated gently with the circulating air.", "Their subtly perfumed breath impregnated with the aroma of sugar-sweetened wines which they had drunk, caused Ravana delight and, some of his consorts, in dream, savoured the lips of their rivals again and again, deeming them to be the king\u2019s. Passionately devoted to their lord, these lovely women, no longer mistresses of themselves, offered their companions marks of their affection. Some, in their rich attire, slept leaning on their arms laden with bracelets, some rested on their companions\u2019 breasts, some on their laps, their bosoms, their thighs and backs, and under the influence of wine, clinging amorously to one another, those women of slender waist, slept, their arms intertwined.", "Those groups of damsels enfolding one another, resembled a garland of flowers visited by amorous bees or, like creepers opening to the caress of the vernal breeze that intertwine, forming clusters of blossom or the interlocking branches of great forest trees full of swarming bees; thus seemed this gathering of Ravana\u2019s consorts. And on account of the proximity of these women, sleeping close to one another, it was impossible to distinguish to whom the jewels, veils and garlands covering their limbs, belonged.", "While Ravana slept, the beauty of those women resembling golden lamps, seemed to watch over him and there were daughters of Rajarishis, Giants and Celestial Beings, who had become his consorts and that war-like titan king had acquired them after subduing their relatives, though some had followed him of their own accord from love. None had been forcibly borne away who had not been attracted by his prowess and qualities and none had belonged to another, save the daughter of Janaka whose heart was set on Rama; none was devoid of nobility, beauty, intelligence and grace and each was the object of Ravana\u2019s desire.", "Then the lord of the monkeys, endowed with virtue, reflected: \u201cIf the consort of Raghava were as one of these women, the King of the Titans would indeed be blessed to-day, but Sita is far superior to them on account of her great qualities, which is evident, since for her sake that mighty monarch of Lanka has committed this wicked deed.", "Looking round, Hanuman observed a splendid dais, worthy of the Gods, made of crystal encrusted with pearls, furnished with couches of emerald mounted on ivory and gold and covered with rich and priceless rugs. And he saw a white canopy, in that place, festooned with celestial garlands that gleamed like the moon.", "And he observed a magnificent couch inlaid with gold, flaming like fire and bearing garlands of Ashoka flowers, around which figures were waving fans to and fro, creating cooling draughts and perfumes of every kind wreathed it with delicious fragrance. Spread with soft woollen cloths and decked with chaplets of flowers, it was adorned on every side.", "And there, resembling a thundercloud, the Sovereign of the Titans lay with bright and flashing earrings, reddened eyes, golden raiment, his limbs smeared with saffron and fragrant sandal, like a purple cloud at dusk, riven with lightning. Adorned with celestial ornaments, magnificent to behold, able to change his form at will, as he lay asleep he resembled the Mandara Mountain with its trees, groves and bushes without number. Having ceased from dalliance, decked with priceless ornaments, the delight of the titans and dear to all the titan women, his feasting over he lay sleeping on the golden bed, breathing like a serpent.", "And Hanuman, filled with awe, shrank back in fear, and stationed himself on a landing of the stairway, pressing himself against the inner wall; then that courageous monkey looked down on that lion among titans lying there in a drunken stupor. And as the King of the Titans lay sleeping, his luxurious couch resembled a great waterfall by which a mighty tusker in mustha is resting.", "Hanuman looked down on the two outstretched arms, encircled with golden bracelets of that gigantic monarch, resembling the standards of Indra, which had formerly been pierced in combat by the sharp tusks of Airavata and torn by the discus of Vishnu and the great shoulders that had been lacerated by India\u2019s mace. Those vast arms, firmly set with well-formed, powerful muscles and thumbs and nails bearing auspicious marks, rings coverings the fingers, those arms, thick as clubs, rounded like the trunk of an elephant, that lay along the opulent couch as it were two snakes with five heads, smeared with sandal of the colour of hare\u2019s blood, fresh, extremely rare and of a delicious fragrance massaged by women of sovereign beauty with precious unguents, those arms that had caused Yakshas, Pannagas, Gandharvas Devas and Danavas to cry out in terror, that monkey gazed upon as they lay along the couch, like two great and angry reptiles sleeping in a cave on the Mandara Mountain. And with his two great arms, the Chief of the Titans resembled Mount Mandara with its twin peaks.", "The scent of the Mango or Punnaga tree, impregnated with that of the Bakula blended with the savour of viands and the aroma of wine, issued from the vast mouth of that Monarch of Titans during sleep and seemed to fill the whole apartment. His diadem was decorated with rubies and precious stones, gleaming with gold and he was adorned with earrings, smeared with red sandal, his well-developed chest bearing a string of pearls; a white silken cloth, flung aside, revealed his scars and he was covered with a costly yellow coverlet. Like a mass of light he lay, hissing like a serpent so that it seemed as if an elephant lay asleep in the deep waters of the Ganges. Four lamps, set on golden pillars, cast their light to the four sides as lightning reveals the surface of a mass of cloud.", "Then that foremost of monkeys saw the wives of that great monarch of the titans sleeping at the foot of their lord, their faces bright as the moon, wearing precious earrings and fresh garlands. Skilled musicians and dancers, they lay in the arms and on the breast of that Indra of Titans, attired in beautiful raiment, and the monkey gazed on those women wearing golden bracelets and earrings set with diamonds and emeralds, their faces fair as the moon, illumined by the reflection of their glittering earrings, lighting the hall as stars illumine the firmament.", "Overcome with drinking and amorous dalliance, those slender-waisted wives of the King of the Demons lay fast asleep where they had been seated; and one, possessed of lovely limbs, skilled in the dance, slept there, wearied by her graceful motions, whilst another, embracing her Vina, looked like a lotus that had fallen into the water clinging to a passing raft; a third darkeyed maiden held her Mankuka in her lap, as a youthful woman would her child, while yet another with graceful limbs and shapely bosom, slept with her tambourine pressed to her heart, as one embraces his love after a long absence. This one, with eyes like lotuses had fallen asleep clasping her Vina, as a beautiful girl enfolds her beloved one affectionately in her arms. Here one of restrained sense lay beside her lute which she encircled with her arms, resembling one affianced lying by the side of her chosen one; there, one whose limbs gleamed like Kanada gold, dimpled, ravishing, her eyes heavy with wine, though sleeping, was striking her drum. One of slender waist and flawless beauty, worn out by feasting, slept with a cymbal in her lap and yet another held a Dindima and had another slung on her back so that she looked like a young mother with her husband and her child. One, with eyes large as lotus petals, clasping her Adambara tightly to her breast, had fallen asleep under the influence of wine and yet another, her water vessel overturned, resembled a flowery wreath that is sprinkled with water to keep it green; another, falling under the sway of sleep, with her hands covered her breasts resembling two golden cups, and one, with eyes like lotuses, fair as the moon, had fallen asleep embracing one of her companions possessed of lovely hips. Peerlessly beautiful women, clasping musical instruments, pressed them to their bosoms like lovers their chosen ones.", "And that monkey beheld a marvellous bed set apart, on which one of these lovely women lay, richly attired, adorned with pearls and precious gems, who seemed to lend radiance to that magnificent apartment. Clad in silk bright as Kanaka gold, Ravana\u2019s favourite Queen, Mandodari by name, that slender-waisted woman of gracious features, lay fast asleep, adorned with ornaments and, seeing her, that offspring of the Wind-God said to himself: \u201cThis one, endowed with the wealth of youth and beauty may be Sita\u201d and he rejoiced exceedingly. Thereafter, in his delight, he leapt into the air, waving his tail and manifesting his joy by his antics, frolicking, singing, climbing up the pillars from whence he dropped to the ground, thus demonstrating his monkey nature.", "Then that mighty monkey dismissed this thought concerning Sita and began to reflect further:", "\u201cSeparated from Rama, that lovely woman would be unable to sleep, eat or adorn herself nor would she submit to any other, were he King of the Celestials himself, for Rama has no equal even among the Gods; this is therefore some other.\u201d", "In this conviction, that foremost of monkeys began to search the banqueting hall anew, anxious to discover Sita.", "Leaning on their tambourines, drums and Celikas, or stretched on luxurious couches, all these women slept soundly, worn out with playing, singing, dancing and drinking. And that leader of monkeys saw thousands of women beautifully adorned, some having fallen asleep discussing each other\u2019s charms, some debating the art of singing, some skilled in discerning time and place, discoursing on circumstance, some given over to merriment and, elsewhere also, he observed beautiful and youthful women who had fallen asleep talking of beauty, or, full of perspicacity, deciding what was opportune. And in their midst, the Lord of the Titans, resembled a bull in a spacious stall, surrounded by graceful kine. Encircled by those women, that King of the Titans looked like a mighty tusker accompanied by female elephants in the forest.", "In the abode of that powerful Titan King, that Hon among monkeys searched the banqueting hall throughout, furnished with every desirable object and he beheld the flesh of buffalo, deer and bear in separate dishes together with peacock and fowl on golden platters, that had not been broached, and percupine, deer and peacocks, seasoned with curds and sochal salt and goats, leverets and fish half consumed, with portions of dressed venison and sauces. There were wines of superior vintage and rare dishes with salted pies spiced with vinegar and diverse confections capable of stimulating the appetite. Costly bracelets and anklets were scattered here and there and fruit was arranged in small dishes, whilst flowers were spread about, lending the whole floor an air of splendour, and elegant couches and seats set round that place of feasting caused it to shine Hke fire. In addition, meats of every kind and flavour, seasoned with diverse substances and dressed by skilful cooks, were placed round the hall and Hanuman observed delicious beverages made of a variety of ingredients, some from sugar, some distilled from fruit and flowers or impregnated with fragrant powders.", "The vast floor reflected the innumerable garlands, golden vessels, crystal bowls and cups lying everywhere and looked exceedingly beautiful and that mighty monkey saw golden wine jars studded with gems, some of which were full of wine, some half full and some wholly drained; and there were many wines that had not yet been served and various kinds of viands that remained untouched.", "Elsewhere he saw many couches that were unoccupied, and some, where women of unsurpassed beauty slept, clasping each other in their arms. One of these youthful women had forcibly possessed herself of another\u2019s quilt and, wrapping herself therein, had fallen asleep. The gentle breathing of these women barely stirred their attire or the garlands that adorned them but caressed them as it were and a gentle breeze, laden with the odour of sandal and the sweet-tasting Sidhu, with the diverse floral wreaths and flowers, perfumed bark prepared for ablutions and incense, spread over the aerial car, Pushpaka.", "And in that residence of the titan there were women of incomparable beauty, some dark-skinned, some the colour of Kancana gold, who, overcome by slumber and worn out with dalliance, resembled sleeping lotuses.", "Thus that mighty monkey searched every quarter of Ravana\u2019s private apartments without seeing Janaki anywhere and, having scanned the faces of all these women, he was filled with apprehension, fearing lest he had failed in his purpose. Then he reflected: \u201cBeholding the wife of another while she is sleeping, is undoubtedly an infringement of the moral law, verily to look on another\u2019s wife was never my intention but here I have seen one who has lusted after the wives of others.\u201d", "Then another thought came to that sagacious monkey, single-mindedly bent on the execution of his duty: \u201cAll these consorts of Ravana have been beheld by me without their knowledge yet I find no fluctuation in the tenor of my mind. The mind is the motive power of every movement of the senses, whether it be good or evil and mine remains untroubled; further, how could I search for Sita otherwise? It is amongst women that one should look for women; every being is to be sought amongst its own kind, none searches for a woman among deer. Therefore with a pure heart I have explored Ravana\u2019s inner apartment but I have not seen the daughter of Janaka.\u201d", "And Hanuman scrutinized the faces of the daughters of Devas, Danavas and Nagas, without finding Sita and, not finding her in that place, he left the banqueting hall and began to search elsewhere. Leaving that place of feasting, the offspring of the Wind-god began to look for Sita in another quarter.", "Remaining in the precincts of the palace, Hanuman searched the arbours, galleries and the sleeping apartments, eager to discover Sita but without being able to find that lady of gracious appearance there; and, not finding the beloved of that descendant of Raghu, the mighty monkey reflected:\u2014", "\u201cSince, despite mine exertions I am unable to find the daughter of Mithila, assuredly Sita is no longer alive. That youthful and virtuous woman, anxious to defend her honour, has been slain by the wicked Lord of the Titans for remaining faithful to her conjugal duty or the daughter of King Janaka has died of fright on seeing those consorts of the Sovereign of the Titans, who are deformed, sallow-skinned, misshapen and who possess huge heads and monstrous forms. Failing to discover Sita, my valour has been expended in vain and a large part of the term allotted to the monkeys has run out; I dare not present myself before Sugriva, who is powerful and given to meting out harsh punishment. I have explored the inner apartments thoroughly but the gentle Sita was not to be found there and I have spent myself in vain. Further, on my return, the assembled monkeys will enquire of me saying: \u201cO Valiant Hanuman, having reached the further shore, what didst you accomplish there, tell us?\u201d", "Not having seen Janaka\u2019s daughter, what shall I answer? The term fixed having passed, assuredly it is meet that I should fast to death, and what will the aged Jambavan and Angada say with all the assembled monkeys since I have crossed the ocean to no purpose? Yet perseverance is the root of success, perseverance is the root of prosperity, perseverance brings supreme felicity, therefore I will search all those places still left unexplored by me. Moreover it is my intention to put forth fresh efforts and investigate all those regions not yet visited by me and the banqueting halls, the gardens, the sports pavilions, the courtyards, dwellings, highways, alleys and chariots, though already searched by me, shall be examined once again.", "Having thus resolved, Hanuman set about exploring the basements, temples and many-storied dwellings, going up and down, to and fro, opening doors and closing others, entering here and making an exit there, till there was not even the space of four fingers left unscrutinized by him. And he visited the galleries running inside the ramparts and terraces supported by stanchions and the groves and lotus pools and he saw there hideous and monstrous female titans of every shape but not the daughter of Janaka; and the illustrious consorts of Vidyadharas fell under his gaze but not the beloved of Raghava.", "Hanuman beheld there also the daughters of Nagas, of lovely limbs, whose faces shone like the full moon, who had been forcibly brought there by the Lord of the Titans, but not the cherished daughter of Janaka and, not seeing her among all those lovely women, a profound despair seized that warrior born of Maruta.", "Reflecting that the exertions of all those leaders of monkeys and the crossing of the ocean had proved vain, the son of Anila became extremely anxious and descended from that aerial car. Thereafter Hanuman, born of Maruta, grew pensive and a great melancholy invaded his soul.", "Descending on to the ramparts from the aerial car, that leader of monkeys, the agile Hanuman, resembled a flash of lightning athwart the clouds and, having searched the apartments of Ravana without finding Sita, Videha\u2019s daughter, he said to himself:\u2014", "\u201cSeeking the object of Rama\u2019s affection, I have explored Lanka again and again without finding the daughter of Janaka of immaculate form! Many times have the marshes, pools, lakes, streams, rivers, banks, forests and inaccessible mountains been scoured by me without any trace of Sita being found!", "\u201cThe King of the Vultures, Sampati, affirmed that Sita was in Ravana\u2019s palace but I do not see her there, how can this be? Or has the daughter of Videha, Maithili, born of Janaka, who was carried away against her will, being wholly helpless surrendered to Ravana? Or perchance, fearing Rama\u2019s arrows, in his rapid flight, that titan has allowed Sita to slip from his grasp or she seeing herself borne away on the path of the Siddhas and beholding the ocean, has yielded up her life? Who can say whether that noble large-eyed lady has not succumbed on account of the great speed assumed by Ravana and the pressure of his arms?", "\u201cIt may happen that, while Ravana flew over the sea, the daughter of Janaka struggling to free herself, fell into the waves, or alas, far from her lord, seeking to defend her honour, was devoured by that vile Ravana. May not that innocent dark-eyed lady have become the food of those impure consorts of that Indra of demons? Ever absorbed in the contemplation of Rama, whose countenance resembles the moon, has she breathed her last, bewailing her lot and crying: \u2018O Rama! O Lakshmana! O Ayodhya!\u2019, or, having been banished to the dungeons of Ravana\u2019s palace, is that youthful woman grieving like a caged bird? How could the slender-waisted consort of Rama, born of the blood of Janaka, possessing eyes like lotus petals, submit to Ravana? But whether she be slain or is lost or has died, I dare not speak of it to Rama. To tell him would be an offence, yet it is also wrong to withhold it from him; what should I do? I am perplexed 1 In such a dilemna, how shall I act?\u201d", "Thus thinking, Hanuman added:\u2014\u201cIf, without finding Sita, I return to the city of that lord among monkeys, in how far will my courage have availed me? My crossing of the ocean has come to nought as also my entry into Lanka and my survey of the titans. When I come to Kishkindha, what will Sugriva and the assembled monkeys say to me or those twin sons of Dasaratha? If I approach Kakutstha with these fatal tidings saying: \u2018I have not found Sita\u2019, he will give up his life. Hearing these cruel, terrible, heartrending and barbarous words, he will not survive and, when his mind has been withdrawn into the five elements, the sagacious Lakshmana, deeply attached to Rama, will also cease to exist! Then, hearing that his two brothers are dead, Bharata will yield up his life and Shatrughna will renounce his existence also. Beholding their sons dead, their mothers, Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi will undoubtedly surrender their lives and, seeing Rama\u2019s plight, his grateful and loyal friend, Sugriva, will give up his fife. Then the grief-stricken Ruma, distracted and crushed with sorrow, will perish on account of her lord and the Queen Tara, already inconsolable on account of Bali\u2019s end, worn out by suffering will be unable to continue living. The loss of his parents will lead the youthful Angada to the brink of death and, overwhelmed by the passing of their leader, the inhabitants of the woods having been cherished with gentleness, gifts and regard by their illustrious monarch, will strike their heads with their fists and die.", "\u201cThenceforth, those foremost of monkeys will no longer assemble to disport themselves in the woods, among the rocks and caves, but with their sons, wives and servants, in despair on account of their master\u2019s death, will hurl themselves from the height of the rocks into the abysses and chasms. And they will take poison or hang themselves or enter the fire or fast to death or fall on their own weapons. It is certain that a great calamity will follow my return and the House of Ikshvaku and the inhabitants of the forests will meet with destruction.", "\u201cBut, if I do not return, those two virtuous and great carwarriors as also the swift-footed monkeys will continue to live in the hope of receiving tidings of Sita, and I, not having found Sita, shall exist by that which falls to my lot, living a life of privation and subsisting on fruit and roots in die forest.", "\u201cPreparing a funeral pyre on the shores of the sea, in a place abounding in roots, fruits and water, I shall enter the flames or allow myself to die of hunger and, without fail, offer my emaciated frame as food for the birds and beasts of prey. In my belief, this is the death the sages envisaged for themselves; either I must find Janaki or enter the sea.", "\u201cMy bright garland of glory, so nobly plaited and begot of courageous acts has perished because I have not been able to find Sita. I shall therefore become an ascetic living under the trees but return I will not without having seen that darkeyed damsel. If I go back without finding Sita, neither Angada nor the other monkeys will survive. Yet incalculable ills lie in store for one taking his own life; if however I continue to live, I may achieve success, therefore I shall maintain my existence I If I live, the re-union of Rama and Sita may be effected.\u201d", "Revolving these innumerable and painful considerations in his mind, that lion among monkeys sought to prevent himself from being overcome by despair. Summoning up all his courage, that mighty monkey said to himself:\u2014", "\u201cI shall slay Dashagriva the terrible Ravana and thus avenge the abduction of Sita or, crossing the sea, I shall drag him before Rama as a beast is offered up to Pashupati.\u201d", "Reflecting thus, that monkey, who was filled with anxiety and grief, not having been able to find Sita, thought: \u201cSo long as I do not find the illustrious consort of Rama, I shall not cease from searching the city of Lanka on every side. If, according to Sampati\u2019s words, I bring Rama hither, Raghava, not beholding his consort, will burn all the monkeys with the fire of his wrath. Therefore I shall stay here, living a life of abstinence with my senses under control lest all men and monkeys perish through my fault.", "\u201cHere is a great Ashoka grove, containing huge trees, which has not yet been searched by me. Having paid reverence to the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Ashvins and the Maruts, in order to increase the torment of the titans, I shall enter it. Having vanquished the demons, I shall restore the divine Sita, the delight of the House of Ikshvaku to Rama as the fruit of austerity is bestowed on an ascetic.\u201d", "Having thus reflected for a space, the mighty offspring of the Wind-god suddenly rose and said: \u201cSalutations to Rama accompanied by Lakshmana and Anila! Salutations to Candra, Agni and the Maruts 1\u201d", "After paying obeisance to all the Gods as also to Sugriva, the offspring of the Wind-god, surveying the four quarters, in imagination as it were advanced towards that magnificent grove and began to consider what should be done further.", "He reflected: \u201cThis Ashoka Grove which is sacred with its dense thickets must be filled with titans, its trees are surely protected by trained guards and the blessed Vishvatam himself refrains from blowing vigorously here. In Rama\u2019s interests I shall contract my form so that I may not be detected by Ravana. May all the Gods, as also the hosts of sages, confer success on me! May Svyambhu, the Celestial Beings, as also the ascetics, the God of Fire, the God of the Wind, the Bearer of the Thunderbolt, Varuna, the Moon and the Sun, the high-souled Ashvins and all the Maruts grant me success! May all beings and the Lord of all Beings and those unknown, who are met with on the way, confer success on me!", "\u201cWhen shall I behold that noble and irreproachable queen with her arched nose, pearly teeth, sweet smile and eyes resembling lotus petals, bright as the King of the Stars, O when?", "\u201cO how will that frail and virtuous one, ruthlessly borne away by that wicked and vile wretch, the scourge of human beings, who masks his savagery under an alluring disguise, disclose herself to me?\u201d", "Having meditated for a space, Hanuman, who had rejoined Sita in thought, leapt from the rampart on to the surrounding wall and trembling with delight, that mighty monkey, standing there, beheld every variety of tree and flower, it being early spring He saw Sala, Ashoka, Bhavya, Champaka, Uddalaka, Nagavriksha, Mango and Kapimukha trees in flower with clumps of Amras intertwined with hundreds of creepers. And Hanuman, leaping down into that enchanting grove, like an arrow shot from a bow, entered that garden resembling the rising sun which re-echoed to the song of birds, planted with gold and silver saplings and containing flocks of birds and deer with trees of varying fragrance which.filled him with wonder.", "Abounding in trees of every kind, laden with flowers and fruit, where cuckoos called deliriously and swarms of bees hummed, where all creatures expressed happiness in their movements, where the cries of the peacock could be heard and waterfowl teemed, the heart of the beholder was ravished.", "And Hanuman, searching for that princess of beautiful and faultless limbs, woke the birds that had been sleeping sweetly and blown by the wind set up by the wings of those birds in flight, a shower of variegated blossom fell, covering Hanuman, the son of the Wind-god in the midst of the Ashoka Grove lending him the loveliness of a hill covered with flowers. Then all the creatures beholding that monkey, as they darted from all sides, thought: \u201cIt is the God of Spring\u201d.", "Wholly hidden in blossom which had fallen from the trees, the earth looked like a bride covered with jewels and, shaken in diverse ways by the motion of that impetuous monkey the trees rained down a shower of multi-coloured blooms. And those trees, whose tops were stripped of leaves, from which both blossom and fruit had fallen, looked like gamblers who have staked their raiment and possessions only to lose all. Buffetted by Hanuman\u2019s leaping, those lovely trees speedily let their flowers, leaves and fruit fall to the ground and, deserted by the birds, no longer able to seek shelter there, on account of the shaking administered by Maruti, presented their bare branches only, so that the Ashoka grove, battered by the blows of the monkey\u2019s feet and tail, resembled a youthful woman with her locks dishevelled, the brightness of her lips and teeth dimmed, her tilaka mark effaced and her arms and legs scarred. And in his haste, that monkey snapped the clusters of creepers as the wind dispels the clouds during the rainy season.", "Ranging here and there, that monkey observed places that were paved with gold and silver with ponds filled with translucent water, their steps encrusted with valuable gems, pearls and coral, their floors being of crystal and the banks set with trees of Kancana gold which emitted a dazzling light.", "These pools were covered with clumps of lotuses and lilies whilst waterfowl enhanced their beauty and they re-echoed to the cry of Natyuhas, swans and geese; broad and beautiful streams, bordered on every side by trees, fed them with their waters which resembled Amrita and glided under variegated shrubs decorated by hundreds of creepers, the ground being carpeted by rhododendron and oleander flowers.", "Then that foremost of monkeys beheld a high hill, bright as a cloud crowned with lofty peaks, many kinds of trees and filled with caves, and it was one of the wonders of the world 1 And he beheld a river falling from those heights, like a youthful woman tearing herself from her lover\u2019s aims in order to leave him and the branches of the trees, sweeping the water, looked as if the companions of that damsel were detaining her, whilst fuither down, Hanuman beheld that stream returning on its course, as if the maiden, appeased, were reconciled to her beloved.", "Thereafter at some distance from the river, a pool filled with lotuses, frequented by birds of every kind drew the gaze of that lion among monkeys, Hanuman, born of Maruta; and he saw a fountain of fresh water with enchanting steps made of precious gems, its basin strewn with pearls, which was embellished on every side with countless herds of deer, ravishing groves, and mansions built by Vishvakarma himself, adorned with artificial woods and trees laden with fruit and flowers, their branches spreading like umbrellas giving shade, whilst the ground beneath was paved with gold and silver.", "And that great monkey beheld a single golden Shingshapa tree surrounded by a golden dais and he saw many flower beds and trees which resembled flames, the radiance of which rivalled Mount Meru and caused him to think they were made of gold. Seeing those beautiful golden trees, with their flowering crests, buds and shoots agitated by the wind, emitting a sound like the tinkling of many ornaments, Hanuman was astounded.", "Climbing quickly into that many-leafed Shingshapa tree Hanuman reflected: \u201cFrom here I may perchance behold Vaidehi, that unhappy being who sighs for Rama\u2019s presence and who, filled with grief, wanders aimlessly to and fro. Without doubt, this Ashoka Grove embellished by Candana, Champaka and Vakula trees, belongs to the wicked Ravana. Here by this lovely pool frequented by birds, that princess and royal spouse, Sita, will certainly repair. She, the beloved of Raghava, accustomed to wander in the woods, bereft of Rama, will assuredly come hither. That lady, whose eyes resemble a doe\u2019s, tormented with grief on account of separation from Rama, fond of roving in the woods, will certainly walk in this grove. She, the chaste and virtuous wife of Rama, Janaka\u2019s daughter, who ever loved the creatures of the forest, anxious to offer up her devotion, will come to this river of translucent waters, for this purpose.", "\u201cTruly this beautiful grove is worthy to be the abode of that chaste consort of the king of men, Rama. If that goddess, whose countenance resembles the moon, still lives, she will inevitably visit this river of cool waters.\u201d", "Thus reflected the high-souled Hanuman, expecting the consort of that lord of men to appear and, concealing himself in the Shingshapa tree covered with leaves and flowers, gazed out over the whole scene.", "Seated in the tree, glancing round in quest of Sita, Hanuman surveyed the entire grove filled with trees intertwined with creepers and redolent with celestial odours. Manifesting every aspect of beauty, possessing the splendour of the Nandana Gardens, it was inhabited by various animals and birds, embellished by palaces and temples and re-echoed to the call of the cuckoo. Adorned with pools filled with golden lotuses and silvery waterlilies, furnished with seats and cushions, buildings and courtyards, with its ravishing trees laden with fruit and flowers in every season and the blossoming Ashoka trees, it resembled the effulgence of the rising sun.", "Seated there, Maruti never wearied of gazing on those lovely woods, whose foliage was almost concealed by hundreds of birds disporting themselves there and the beauty of those Ashoka trees, bending under the weight of their flowers, so that their blossoming seemed to extend to their very roots, dispelled all sorrow. The entire region seemed ablaze with the brilliance of the Karnikara and Kimshuka trees in flower; the giant-rooted Punnaga, Saptapama, Champaka and Udda-laka blazed forth in blossom and there were thousands of Ashoka trees some of a golden colour, some like flames of fire and some as dark as collyrium so that the whole place resembled the Garden of Nandana or the enchanting domain of Caitaratha or even surpassed them. This celestial unimaginably beautiful region was like a second heaven, having flowers for its constellations or a fifth ocean, its pearls being the blossom scattered there. Planted with trees, which bloomed in every season, emitting honeyed scents, that garden was filled with the cries of birds and beasts and redolent with exquisite scents, a delicious spot, equal to that King of Mountains, a second Gandhamadana.", "Now, in that Ashoka Grove, that lion among monkeys observed, at a short distance, a splendid temple as white as Mount Kailasha, flawless, supported by a thousand pillars, its steps of coral, its floors of refined gold, dazzlingly beautiful, blinding to the eyes and of such a height that it seemed to kiss the sky.", "Then, all at once, he beheld a woman, in soiled raiment, surrounded by female titans and she was emaciated through fasting, sorrowful, heaving frequent sighs, immaculate as the moon\u2019s disc in its first quarter, resplendent with a radiance which now shone but dimly so that she seemed like a flame wreathed in smoke.", "Clad in a soiled robe of yellow silk, divested of every ornament, she resembled a lotus pool stripped of its flowers. Oppressed, racked with grief and tormented, she was like unto Rohini pursued by Ketu. Her face bathed in tears, distressed, worn out by privation, plunged in anxiety and separated from her kith and kin, no longer able to behold Rama and Lakshmana but only the titans, she appeared like a gazelle surrounded by a pack of hounds.", "With her long hair resembling a black serpent, hanging down her back, she looked like the earth with its dark blue forests in the rainy season. That large-eyed lady, worthy of happiness, not having known adversity till that hour, sunk in woe and emaciated was attired in soiled raiment.", "Then Hanuman, beholding her, for many reasons deduced that it was Sita and reflected:\u2014\u201cThat princess, borne away by the titan, able to change his shape at will, must be this woman before me.\u201d", "Her face shone like the full moon and she possessed beautiful brows and gracefully rounded breasts; by her radiance she dispelled the darkness in all regions; her neck was of a bluish tint, her lips like the Bimba fruit, her waist slender and her carriage full of dignity, her eyes, resembling lotus petals equalled those of Rati, the beloved spouse of Manmatha, lovely as the moon, adored by all.", "Now that youthful woman of graceful form was seated on the ground practising austerity like a female ascetic and that timid lady was heaving frequent sighs like the consort of the Serpent King.", "Entangled in a mighty web of sorrow, her beauty was veiled like a flame enveloped in smoke or a traditional text obscured by dubious interpretation or wealth that is melting away or faith that is languishing or hope that is almost extinguished or perfection unattained on account of obstacles or an intellect which is darkened or fame tarnished by calumny.", "Distracted by her separation from Rama, tormented by the presence of the female titans, her eyes, like a young doe\u2019s ranged here and there searching everywhere in her distress. Tears streamed from her eyes with their arched brows and dark lashes and, her features altered, she sighed again and again. That unfortunate one, worthy of every decoration, now bereft of all, covered with stains, resembled the King of the Stars obscured by heavy cloud. Beholding Sita in that pitiable state, Hanuman was perplexed as one whose learning is lost for lack of sustained endeavour and, seeing her without ornaments, he recognised her with difficulty as a text that is wrongly construed. Beholding that large-eyed and irreproachable princess, Hanuman concluded from her many distinctive characteristics that it must indeed be Sita.", "Perceiving on her person such ornaments as had been described by Rama at the time of his departure, such as the Svadangstras and jewelled armlets, which were now darkened by dust and neglect, nevertheless, they appeared to Hanuman to be those mentioned to him and he reflected:\u2014\u201cThose which were cast off by Sita on the way, I do not see but those she preserved are certainly here.", "\u201cThe rich silken mantle shining like Kanaka gold, which she let fall, was found by the monkeys caught in a tree and the valuable ornaments cast off by her fell on the earth with a tinkling sound. The robe she now wears is exceedingly worn but its colour remains and resembles her own radiance. Here is the one for whom Rama has suffered torment through affection, pity, grief and love: through affection in consequence of his beloved spouse being borne away; through pity, by his inability to protect her who is dependent on him; through grief, at her loss, and through love by his separation from her. Verily from the grace of her person and her beauty, that resembles his, this lady of dark eyes must be his spouse.", "She has her mind fixed on him, and he on her, it is on account of this that they are able to survive. Indeed the Lord Rama has achieved a great feat by still existing separated from her and not yielding up his life in grief.\u201d", "Having beheld Sita, the Son of Pavana allowed his thoughts to fly to Rama, to whom he silently offered obeisance, and to that princess also.", "Having offered obeisance to Sita who was worthy of homage, and also to Rama of gentle conduct, that bull among monkeys became absorbed in thought once more.", "Reflecting awhile, his eyes full of tears on account of Sita, that sagacious monkey, Hanuman, gave voice to his distress in the following words:\u2014", "\u201cNone can withstand the force of destiny, since Sita, the consort of the illustrious brother of Lakshmana ever obedient to his preceptors, has met with this misfortune. Conversant with the prowess of Rama and the sagacious Lakshmana, that divine lady is no more perturbed than is the Ganges at the approach of the rainy season. In character, age, conduct and family, they are equal and Raghava is worthy of Vaidehi, that one of dark eyes, who is his.\u201d", "Seeing Sita, radiant as newly minted gold and who resembled Lakshmi beloved of the worlds, Hanuman approaching Rama in thought, said:\u2014", "\u201cOn account of this large-eyed lady, the mighty Bali was slain, and Kabanda, equal to him in strength; for her, the mighty demon Viradha, despite his renowned prowess, also succumbed in the forest under the thrusts of the valiant Rama, as Shambara under Mahendra\u2019s blows. It was for her that fourteen thousand demons of outstanding exploits were pierced by Rama\u2019s arrows resembling tongues of fire in Janasthana. Khara too was brought low on the field of battle; Trishiras was overthrown and the mighty Dushana also by the righteous Raghava. And it was on her account that that supreme and inaccessible kingdom of the monkeys belonging to Bali was acquired by Sugriva, renowned in the Three Worlds; it is for this large-eyed damsel, that the effulgent Lord of the Waters has been crossed by me and this city explored. Methinks that if Rama had turned the whole earth, with its boundaries, upside down for her sake, it were fitting! Were the dominion of the Three Worlds on one side and Sita, born of Janaka, on the other, the former would not equal a fraction of the latter; such is the virtuous daughter of the magnanimous King of Mithila, who is wholly devoted to her lord. She, as a field was being dug, rose from a furrow which the blade of the plough had turned, covered with dust which gleamed like the pollen of a lotus; she, the eldest daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha, who was full of courage and nobility and was never known to retreat in battle; she, the beloved consort of the faithful and dutiful Rama, knower of his own Self, is now in the power of the titans.", "\u201cRenouncing every pleasure, actuated by love of her lord, disregarding the inevitable privations, she entered the beautiful forest to live on fruit and roots, ever engaged in the service of her spouse and considered herself to have attained the peak of felicity there, as if it were the palace itself. This lady, whose limbs resemble Kanaka gold and who was ever wont to smile when conversing, now suffers unimaginable woes and Raghava, like a thirsty man panting for a stream, sighs for the sight of that noble woman oppressed by Ravana. Reunited with her, Raghava will enjoy felicity once more, as a king who has been deprived of his throne rejoices on regaining it.", "\u201cDeprived of all comfort and pleasure, far from her kinsmen, she preserves her life in the hope of seeing Rama and being reunited with him. Oblivious of the titans and the trees covered with fruit and flowers, her spirit is wholly absorbed in the thought of Rama. For a woman the greatest decoration is her lord and Sita, though incomparably beautiful, no longer shines in Rama\u2019s absence. It is only Rama\u2019s heroism that makes it possible for him to continue living separated from his consort and prevents him from being overwhelmed with grief. This lady of dark eyes, resembling the moonlight, worthy of happiness, is now utterly wretched and my heart is troubled. Patient as the earth, this lady whose eyes resemble lotuses, who was formerly protected by Rama and Lakshmana, lying at the foot of a tree, is being guarded by demons of hideous aspect. Like a waterlily snapped by the frost, the daughter of Janaka, her beauty faded, is fainting under the rain of misfortunes and, like a doe separated from the herd, is fallen into this distress. The Ashoka trees with their boughs bending under the weight of their blossom seem to increase her grief, as also the moon of pure beams that is rising in this spring season.\u201d", "Reflecting thus, that valiant monkey, being convinced that it was Sita, stationed himself in the Shingshapa tree.", "Then the moon, pure as a waterlily, rose in the stainless heavens, sailing through the firmament like a swan floating on blue waters. As if to aid him with her light, that pure and clear orb covered the Son of Pavana with her cool rays.", "Thereupon that monkey beheld Sita endowed with a moonlike countenance who, under the load of grief, resembled a heavily laden ship foundering in the waves. And gazing on Vaidehi, Hanuman, born of Maruta, observed a number of grim-visaged titan women at a distance, some with but a single eye or ear, some with ears concealing their visage, some without ears, some with noses on their foreheads, some possessed of disproportionately large heads and long necks, some with sparse hair and others covered with hair so that they appeared to be wrapped in a woollen cloth; the ears and brows of some were set low, and their breasts and bellies protruded; others were knock-kneed, stunted, humpbacked, crooked, dwarfed, unkempt, their mouths set awry, their eyes inflamed, their faces fearful to behold Hideous, irascible, quarrelsome, they were armed with spears, darts, hammers and mallets and some had snouts like bears or the muzzles of deer or the faces of tigers, camels, buffalo, goats and jackals and some had the feet of elephants, camels, horses and the heads of some were sunk in their breasts.", "Some had a single hand or foot, some the ears of asses, horses, kine and elephants or some the ears of monkeys. Some had enormous noses, some crooked noses and some none at all, some had noses like the trunks of elephants, some had their noses fixed in their foreheads, through which they breathed like beasts. The feet of some were like elephants and some had the feet of kine, some were hairy; some had huge heads, gigantic faces and long tongues; some had the heads of goats, elephants, cows, pigs, horses, camels and donkeys.", "These titan women of formidable appearance held spears and maces in their hands, they were ill-humoured and rejoiced in discord. Their hair was black as soot or smoke-coloured, their aspect repellant and they feasted continually, regaling themselves on wine and meat without surcease, their bodies being spattered with blood from the flesh they consumed.", "That foremost of monkeys surveyed those titan women whose appearance caused his hair to stand on end and who were seated in a circle round the many-branched tree under which the divine and irreproachable Janaki stood. And the graceful Hanuman beheld that daughter of Janaka bereft of her radiance, consumed with grief, her locks soiled with dust, like a star which has fallen on the earth its merits exhausted, Sita, famed throughout the worlds for her fidelity, yet with little hope of being re-united with her lord.", "Stripped of her jewels, she whose chief ornament was her devotion to her lord, held captive by Ravana, appeared like a female elephant separated from the herd who has been attacked by a lion or like the moonlight enveloped in cloud at the end of the rainy season. Her beauty dimmed, she resembled a stringed instrument that one has ceased to pluck and has laid aside. Far from her lord, that illustrious one had fallen under the sway of the titans without having merited it. Sunk in an ocean of grief, surrounded by those titan women in the midst of the Ashoka Grove, she looked like Rohini about to be devoured by Rahu and, beholding her there, Hanuman thought she resembled a creeper divested of its blooms. Having lost her radiance, her limbs covered with dust, with her hidden grace she looked like a lotus spattered with mud.", "The monkey, Hanuman, beheld that youthful woman, whose eyes resembled a doe\u2019s, clothed in a soiled and tattered cloth and though that blessed one was shorn of her beauty, yet her soul did not lose its transcendency, upheld as it was by the thought of Rama\u2019s glory and safeguarded by her own virtue.", "Beholding Sita, whose eyes, wide with fear, resembled a doe\u2019s, casting her glances here and there like a fawn and consuming the trees and their leaves with her sighs, like a mountainous wave rising from the ocean of adversity, incomparably beautiful with her slender limbs and graceful form, bereft of ornaments, Maruti experienced a great felicity; and Hanuman wept tears of joy at this fortunate meeting and silently offered obeisance to Rama.", "Having bowed down to Rama and Lakshmana, the valiant Hanuman, filled with happiness on having beheld Sita, remained there wholly concealed.", "Surveying the woods filled with flowering trees, desirous of beholding Sita closely and the night being almost spent, towards dawn, Hanuman heard the chanting of the Vedas by those among the titans conversant with the holy Shastras and the six supplementary portions.", "Then the mighty ten-headed Lord of the Titans awoke to the sound of auspicious music, delightful to the ear and, waking, that great and powerful king, his garlands and attire in disarray, remembered Vaidehi. Passionately enamoured of her, that titan filled with pride could not restrain his desire.", "Thereupon, adorned with every kind of ornament, gorgeously robed, he entered the Ashoka Grove filled with innumerable trees, laden with fruit and flowers of every kind with pools embellished with lotuses and lilies, enlivened by birds of rare beauty ecstatic with love and sculptured wolves wonderful to behold.", "Dashagriva gazed on those avenues with their arches of gold and gems, thronged with deer of every sort and carpeted with the fruit that had fallen on the earth. And one hundred damsels, daughters of the Gods and Gandharvas, followed in the train of the son of Paulastya, resembling the nymphs who follow Mahendra and some carried lamps of gold whilst others bore chanvaras and fans in their hands. Some carrying water in golden ewers, walked ahead, others following with a golden seat and round cushions and one on his right bore a cup encrusted with gems and filled with wine whilst another carried a canopy resembling a swan, golden-ribbed like the moon and having a handle of fine gold.", "In this way, the most beautiful of Ravana\u2019s wives, their eyes heavy with sleep and wine followed their august lord like flashes of lightning following a cloud. Their bracelets and necklets of pearl, swung to and fro, their sandal-paste was effaced and their hair hung loose while drops of perspiration stood on the brows of those women of lovely mien who stumbled on account of the effects of wine and sleep, and the sweat had caused the flowers that adorned them to wither and their locks were full of shreds from their garlands; in this way, those women of tender appearance full of pride and affection, followed the King of the Titans.", "And that powerful lord, the slave of his desires, his heart fixed on Sita, proceeded at a slow pace.", "Then the monkey heard the sound of the bells on the women\u2019s girdles and anklets, and the joy of Maruta beheld Ravana of inconceivable prowess, whose energy and valour were unimaginable, as he entered the gate; and he was illumined on all sides by the innumerable lamps, fed with fragrant oil, which were carried by those damsels and, intoxicated with pride, desire and wine, his eyes of a coppery red, he looked like Kandarpa himself bereft of his bow. He adjusted his magnificent cloak, decorated with flowers, stainless as the foam of Amrita when churned, and which flung back was held by a clasp.", "Hanuman, concealed behind the curtain of leafy branches, stared at him as he approached and from his hiding place, that elephant among monkeys beheld that mighty king, Ravana, surrounded by beautiful and youthful brides, with majestic strides enter that grove, which re-echoed to the cry of deer and birds. Already intoxicated, adorned with priceless ornaments, possessing pointed ears resembling darts, full of energy, that Son of Vaishravas, the Lord of the Titans, appeared surrounded by lovely women, as the moon amidst the stars, and that illustrious monkey, beholding him, reflected:\u2014", "\u201cThis is the long-armed Ravana who was formerly sleeping in that sumptuous apartment in the centre of the city.\u201d", "Then the valiant Hanuman, born of Maruta, despite his great courage and though highly effulgent, found himself eclipsed by Ravana\u2019s glory and effaced himself among the leafy branches. Ravana however, eager to see that dark-eyed Sita of faultless limbs, whose breasts touched each other, and whose tresses were black, strode on.", "Beholding Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, endowed with youth and beauty, wearing gorgeous raiment and priceless jewels, that irreproachable princess trembled like a palm agitated by the wind and, covering her breasts and belly with her hands, seeking to conceal them, shrank away.", "Dashagriva gazed on Vaidehi, who was guarded by companies of female titans and that unfortunate One, given over to grief, resembled a ship foundering in the sea.", "Seated on the naked ground, Sita who was fixed in virtue, resembled a branch severed from a tree that has fallen to earth. Her limbs covered with a soiled cloth, she, who was worthy of ornaments, now no longer adorned, resembled a lotus stalk stained with mud and, though radiant, her beauty was dimmed.", "In imagination, she took refuge with that lion among men, Rama, her mind a chariot drawn by the steeds of resolution and that charming princess, devoted to Rama, emaciated, weeping, separated from her kinsfolk, was a prey to anxiety and grief and saw no end to her misfortune. Rocking herself to and fro, she resembled the female of the King of the Snakes under the spell of an incantation or the planet Rohini pursued by Dhumaketu or a saintly and virtuous woman of a noble house who finds herself, through marriage, placed in a lowborn family. She resembled a great reputation that has been lost or a faith that has been disregarded or a mind that has become clouded or a hope destroyed, a future shattered, an order misinterpreted, a region obliterated at the destruction of the world or an offering rejected by the Gods, a night on which the full moon is obscured by clouds or a lotus pool laid waste, an army bereft of its warriors, a moon under eclipse, a dried up river, an altar which has been desecrated or a flame that has been extinguished or a lotus pool bereft of flowers, its birds struck with terror agitated by the trumpeting of elephants.", "In separation from her lord, consumed with grief, she appeared like a river whose waters have run dry and on account of her limbs not having been washed, she resembled night during the period of the waning moon. That lovely and graceful woman, accustomed to a palace filled with precious gems, now, with wasted limbs, resembled the stalk of a lotus freshly plucked and wilting in the sun.", "As the female elephant which has been captured, chained to a stake, grieving for its mate, sighs again and again, so seemed she. Her long dark tresses, utterly neglected, lay along her back so that she appeared like the earth covered with a dark forest at the end of the rainy season. Tortured by hunger, sorrow, anxiety and fear, emaciated, desolate, weakened by abstinence and given over to austerity, stricken with grief, resembling a goddess, her hands were joined offering prayers to Rama for the destruction of Ravana.", "And beholding that blameless Maithili with her beautiful dark eyes and graceful lashes, Ravana, to his own destruction, sought to seduce her.", "Thereupon Ravana approaching Sita, who was helpless, surrounded by female titans and vowed to a life of austerity, with sweet words and courteous gestures said to her:\u2014", "\u201cO You whose thighs resemble the trunk of an elephant, who, beholding me dost seek to conceal your breasts and your body as if you didst fear me, O Lady of large eyes, I love you. Be gracious to me, O You of charming looks, who art adored by all the world! There is no man present here nor any titan able to change his form at will therefore banish the fear which I inspire in you, O Sita.", "\u201cIt has ever been the unquestioned and special privilege of titans to unite themselves with the wives of others, either taking them of their own free will or bearing them away by force. In spite of this, O Maithili, I shall not lay hands on you since you have no affection for me but, for myself, I am completely under your sway, therefore trust in me and respond to my love. O Goddess, have no fear of me, take courage, O Dear One, and do not let thyself be consumed with grief. To wear but a single plait, to lie on the earth in soiled attire and fast unnecessarily does not become you. In my company, O Maithili, do you enjoy garlands, perfumes, sandal, ornaments, wine, rich beds and seats, singing, dancing and music. You are a pearl among women, do not remain in this condition, adorn thyself as heretofore. Having united thyself with me, O Lady of Lovely Form, what will not be thine?", "\u201cThine enchanting youth is passing away, which like the water of a river, once gone, does not return. O You of Fair Looks, the creator of your loveliness, Vishvakrita, after devising you, ceased from his work for I see none who is equal to you in loveliness and grace! Who, having seen you, resplendent with beauty, could withstand you O Vaidehi? Even Brahma Himself is moved, how much more other beings? O You whose countenance resembles the moon, on whatever part of your body mine eyes rest, my gaze is riveted. O Maithili, do you become my consort and renounce this your folly. Become the foremost queen of these innumerable and lovely women who belong to me. O Timid One, all the treasure I have won throughout the worlds I offer you as also my kingdom. O Sportive Damsel, for your sake, having subjugated the entire earth with its many cities, I will confer them on King Janaka. None on this earth can withstand my prowess; behold mine immeasurable valour in battle I Did not the Celestials and the Demons find me irresistible on the battlefield as I broke through their ranks shattering their standards?", "\u201cTherefore yield to my desire and attire thyself in splendid robes, letting brilliant gems adorn your person. O Timid One, enjoy every comfort and luxury according to your pleasure, divert thyself and distribute land and treasure to others. Live happily depending on my support and exercise supreme authority. By my favour, all your relatives shall share your felicity. Observe my prosperity and glory, O Gentle Lady, what canst you hope from Rama who is clothed in robes of bark? O Fortunate One, Rama has been deprived of his kingdom and is bereft of his might, he practises asceticism, his couch is the bare earth, indeed it is doubtful whether he still lives. O Vaidehi, Rama will never be able to find you, you who resemblest a star veiled by dark clouds preceded by cranes. Raghava will never rescue you from my hands, as Hiranyakashipu was not able to recover his consort Kirti, who had fallen under the sway of Indra.", "\u201cO Lady of Sweet Smiles, O You of lovely teeth and beautiful eyes, you dost ravish my heart as Suparna carried away a serpent. Although your robe is torn and stained and you are stripped of ornaments, seeing you, my mind turns away from all my other consorts. O Daughter of Janaka, do you hold sway over all the women in my harem, who are endowed with every accomplishment. O Princess of raven locks, these women, the foremost among the beauties of the world, shall be your slaves and attend on you as the Apsaras attend on Shri. O Graceful Princess, enjoy the pleasures of the world with me and the riches of Kuvera to the utmost of your desires. O Goddess, neither in asceticism, strength, prowess, wealth nor fame is Rama equal to me. Therefore drink, eat, enjoy thyself and indulge in every pleasure. I shall confer on you immense wealth, nay, the whole world.", "\u201cDo you satisfy all your desires in my company, O Timid One, and let your relatives share your felicity also. Adorned with dazzling golden bracelets, O Beautiful One, in my company range the groves of flowering trees on the shores of the sea where the black bees hum.\u201d", "Hearing the words of that terrible titan, Sita, overwhelmed with grief, answered in a faint and feeble voice. The unfortunate Sita, afflicted and trembling, faithful to her lord and anxious to preserve her virtue, her heart fixed on Rama, placed a straw between Ravana and herself and with a sweet smile answered him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cTake back your heart and set it on thine own consorts. As a sinner may not aspire to heaven, so should you not expect to win me. That which should never be done and is condemned in a woman faithful to her lord, I shall never do. Born in a noble House, I have been joined to a pious family.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Ravana, the virtuous Vaidehi, turning her back on him, continued:\u2014", "\u201cIt is not meet that I become your wife since I am united to another. Do your duty and follow the rules laid down by men of integrity. The wives of others, like thine own, are deserving of protection, O Prowler of the Night. Do you furnish a good example and enjoy thine own consorts. That wretch who, in the inconstancy and levity of his heart, is not satisfied with his own wives, will be brought to misery by those of others. Either no pious men exist here or you dost not follow their example, since your mind is perverse and turns from what is virtuous; or the wise having uttered sage counsel, you, to the destruction of the titans, dost ignore them.", "\u201cProsperity, kingdom and city are all brought to nought in the hands of a vicious monarch who is not master of himself, hence Lanka, overflowing with treasure, having you for her king, will suffer destruction\u2019ere long. O Ravana, that wicked being who brings about his own downfall, succumbs, to the delight of all. When you meetest with thine end, this evil deed will cause the oppressed to say: \u2018Fortunate are we that this great tyrant has fallen.\u2019", "\u201cYou are not able to tempt me with wealth and riches; as the light of the sun cannot be separated from the sun so do I belong to Raghava. Having rested on the arm of that Lord of Men, how should I depend on any other? Like unto the spiritual truth known to a brahmin faithful to his vows, I belong to the Lord of the World alone and am lawfully wedded to him. It is to thine own advantage to restore me to Rama, wretched as I am, like unto a she-elephant anxiously awaiting her mate in the forest. It behoves you to seek Rama\u2019s friendship, that lion among men, if you desires to preserve Lanka and dost not wish to bring about thine own destruction. He is wise, conversant with every duty and ever eager to serve those who seek his protection; form an alliance with him if you desirest to survive. Seek to conciliate Rama, who is full of devotion to those who take refuge in him and humbly conduct me to him once more. If you dost bring me back to the greatest of the Raghus, your well-being is assured but if you dost act otherwise you are doomed. You mayest evade the thunderbolt of Indra, even death himself may overlook you but there will be no refuge for you from the fury of Raghava, that lord of men, when you dost hear the terrible twanging of Rama\u2019s bow resembling the thunderbolt hurled by Indra. Soon shall those arrows, bearing the impress of Rama and Lakshmana, like serpents with flaming jaws, penetrate Lanka and those shafts, decorated with heron\u2019s plumes, shall cover the whole city annihilating the titans.

Live happily with Ravana, the Lord of the Titans as your consort who owns the treasure of the Three Worlds. You are a woman, O Irreproachable Beauty, and for this dost mourn a man who is banished from his kingdom and who leads a life of misery.\u201d", "Hearing the words of those titans, Sita, her lotus eyes filled with tears, answered them, saying:\u2014\u201cWhat you have uttered is immoral and wholly reprehensible and will never find acceptance with me.

Cease from weeping and lamenting and yield thyself up to pleasure and delight, O Sita; disport thyself with the King of the Titans. O Timid Damsel, dost you not know how swiftly the youth of women is gone? Ere it fades, pass your days happily.

Streams of tears bathed her lovely breast and overcome with affliction, she could see no end to her distress.

Happy are those who are able to look upon my lord, whose eyes resemble the petals of the blossoming trees, whose gait is like a lion\u2019s and who is full of gratitude and gentle of speech. Deprived of the presence of Rama of subdued soul, it is as hard for me to breathe as for him who has swallowed a virulent poison and henceforth my life is forfeit. What heinous fault have I committed in a previous existence that I should now have to suffer such cruel misfortune? So intense is my grief that I long to die, but alas, I am surrounded by these titan women and cannot be reunited with Rama. Cursed is the human state, cursed is dependence on others, since one may not yield up one\u2019s life when one so desires it.\u201d", "Her face bathed in tears, with bowed head the daughter of Janaka began to lament once more and, distracted with grief, beside herself, she rolled on the earth like a colt as though she had lost her senses, crying:\u2014", "\u201cI, the spouse of Raghava, who allowed himself to be deceived by the titans able to change their form at will, was seized by the ruthless Ravana who bore me away.

Of what use is existence, wealth or jewels to me, living amidst the demons far from Rama of the great Car?

Woe is me, vile and wicked creature that I am, since I still breathe, in the absence of my lord. Even my left foot shall not touch that Ranger of the Night, how should I feel any love for Ravana, a titan? He, who in his perversity seeks to seduce me, is not conversant with my nature, nor my race, nor the aversion in which he is held by me.

From each dwelling the groans and cries of the female titans, their husbands slain, would have risen, as mine do now or even louder, and Rama, aided by Lakshmana would range the city, slaughtering the titans, for the foe instantly yields up his life, who comes face to face with them. Then Lanka, its streets filled with smoke issuing from the funeral pyres, encircled by wreaths of vultures, would soon resemble a charnel house. Soon shall I be avenged!

The time fixed by that cruel and wicked Ravana is at hand and that vicious wretch has resolved to destroy me. To ignore what is prohibited, is the practice of these base demons. Terrible is the calamity which will follow this outrage; those titans who live on flesh are ignorant of virtue. Assuredly that titan intends me for his morning repast; I am helpless, what can I do in the absence of my beloved? Deprived of my lord\u2019s presence, stricken with grief, not beholding Rama, the corners of whose eyes are red, may I soon see the God Vaivasvata! Nay, the elder brother of Bharata is unaware that I still live, else he and Lakshmana would have scoured the earth for me.

Perchance the fault is mine, and I have lost the right to happiness, I, the lovely Sita, separated from the illustrious Rama.

It may be that the two brothers, those chiefs of men have laid down their arms, they who feed on the roots and woodland fruits, passing their lives in the forest or they have been put to death through treachery by the vile Ravana, the last of the titans. If that be so, then with all my heart I long for death nor is it forbidden me in my distress. Blessed are those high-souled ascetics who are illumined, their senses subdued, for whom there is neither desire nor aversion; for them, neither love nor hate gives rise to joy or pain; they are free; salutations to those great beings!

Thereafter I saw him seated in a chariot drawn by asses, robed in red, with his body stained likewise, quaffing sesamum oil, laughing and dancing, his mind confused, his senses clouded, speeding towards the south. Again I saw Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, stricken with fear, fall headlong on the earth, thereafter leaping up suddenly, terrified, bemused with liquor, staggering about naked like a madman, incapable of speech yet babbling continuously, stinking and foul, resembling hell itself. Then, proceeding towards the south, he entered a lake where even the mud had dried up and a dark woman clad in red, besmeared with mud, placed a rope round the neck of Dasha-griva dragging him to the region of death.", "\u201cThere I beheld the mighty Kumbhakarna and all the sons of Ravana, their heads shaven, besmeared with oil.

Thereafter a great company of titans wearing red garlands and raiment filed past, playing on stringed instruments, dancing and drinking. And I beheld the enchanting city of Lanka, filled with elephants, chariots and horses, her gateways and arches shattered, falling into the sea. And in Lanka, crimson with flames, the female titans were laughing and creating a terrible clamour, quaffing oil.

Her left thigh, like unto the tapering trunk of an elephant, moved convulsively foretelling that she would soon behold Rama and the golden sari, now covered with dust, of the large-eyed Maithili, whose teeth were like the seeds of a pomegranate, slipped from her beautiful shoulders.", "Comforted by these signs and others also, that foretold a happy ending, Sita of lovely lashes resembling a plant dried by the wind and sun, reviving under tardy rain, experienced a great felicity. Then her countenance, her lips like Bimba fruit, her beautiful eyes, the curve of her lashes and her sharp teeth, recovered their beauty once more as the moon issuing from the mouth of Rahu.", "Her despair and exhaustion removed, her fever allayed, her grief was assuaged and her heart filled with joy and that noble lady looked as beautiful as the moon of cool rays in its waxing period.", "The valiant Hanuman who had heard all that Sita, Trijata and the titans had said, gazed on that illustrious damsel who resembled a celestial being from the Nandana Gardens and many thoughts flitted through the mind of that monkey.", "He reflected: \u201cShe, who was sought in every place by thousands and millions of monkeys, is here and it is I who have found her. Engaged as a skilful spy to discover the strength of the enemy I have stolen into the city and know everything concerning the might of Ravana and the resources of the titans as also of their capital. It is for me to console the consort of that immeasurably illustrious prince, who is compassionate to all beings, for she is pining for her lord. I shall seek to gain the confidence of this lady, whose countenance resembles the full moon, who formerly was unacquainted with suffering and who cannot see any end to her woes. If I return, without having comforted that virtuous lady whose soul is overwhelmed with grief, my journey will have been in vain. In sooth, when I have departed, that illustrious Princess Janaki, giving up all hope of deliverance, will yield up her life and that long-armed warrior, whose countenance resembles the full moon, anxious to behold Sita is equally worthy of consolation. To speak to her in the presence of these titans is impossible, what then shall I do? I am in a great dilemna. If I do not give her some reassurance in the last hour of the night, she will undoubtedly give up her life and if Rama enquires of me, \u2018What did Sita of slender waist say?\u2019 what answer can I give to him if I have had no converse with her? If I return without having achieved my purpose regarding Sita, Kakutstha will consume me with his fiery glance, then it were vain to urge my master to take action for Rama\u2019s sake, by placing himself at the head of his forces.", "\u201cI shall take the first opportunity offered by these titan women to reassure that sorely tried lady, yet in this insignificant form and monkey shape, if I assume a human voice and speak in sanskrita like a sage, Sita will deem me to be Ravana and she will be terrified! It is essential however that I express myself in the human tongue, how otherwise can I inspire this irreproachable lady with courage? Seeing my shape and hearing me speak, Janaki, who has been terrorised by the titans, will be seized with an even greater fear and that illustrious and large-eyed Sita will cry out, imagining me to be Ravana, who is able to change his form at will.", "\u201cHearing her cry, the whole company of titans, armed with every kind of weapon, will form themselves into a great mass resembling death itself and, hideous and indomitable, will rush on me from every side and seek to destroy me or take me captive. Then, beholding me leap from branch to branch and climb to the tops of the highest trees, they will become exceedingly alarmed and will fill the woods with their wild cries; thereafter they will call the titans who are engaged in guarding the king\u2019s palace to their aid and, on account of their native excitability, will seize hold of every kind of weapon, spears, darts, and swords and hasten to join in the fray. Surrounded by them on all sides, if I slay that host of titans, exhausted, I shall be unable to cross the ocean or they, outnumbering me, will succeed in capturing me and, being a prisoner, that lady will reap no benefit from my attempt.", "\u201cAlternatively, in their passion for evil doing, they may even slay the daughter of Janaka, which will completely defeat the great design of Rama and Sugriva! Janaki dwells in an inaccessible and secret place surrounded by the sea, guarded on all sides by the titans with all its approaches closed. If I am slain or captured by the titans in combat, I know of no other monkey who can cross the four hundred miles of sea. Even if I destroy thousands of titans, I should not then be able to reach the other shore of the vast ocean. Battles are hazardous and I do not like to engage in so uncertain an enterprise; what wise person would take any risk in a matter of trust? It would be a great error to frighten Vaidehi by addressing her, yet if I do not do so, she will surely perish. Undertakings often fail through an incompetent messenger unable to take advantage of time and place, as darkness is overcome by the rising sun; in such cases, whether it concerns the accomplishment or avoidance of any matter, the most widely planned projects do not succeed. Assuredly a presumptuous messenger ruins all 1 How shall I act therefore, so that my mission does not prove vain? How shall I show myself equal to this charge? How shall the crossing of the ocean not prove to have been useless? How can I persuade Sita to listen to me without inspiring fear in her?\u201d", "Having put all these questions to himself, Hanuman formed the following resolution:", "\u201cI shall speak to her of Rama of immortal exploits, for then his dear consort will not be afraid of me since she is wholly absorbed in the thought of her lord. In a gentle voice, uttering the name of Rama, the foremost of the Ikshvakus of subdued soul and, lauding his piety and renown in sweet accents, I shall induce Sita to listen to me. There is nothing I will not do to inspire her with confidence.\u201d", "Thereupon, the mighty Hanuman, looking down on the consort of the Lord of the World from the branches of the tree where he sat concealed, spoke to her in melodious and candid tones.", "Having examined the matter from every aspect, that intelligent monkey began to pour sweet words into Vaidehi\u2019s ear, saying:\u2014406", "\u201cThere was a king named Dasaratha, the possessor of chariots, horses and elephants, one by nature devout and illustrious, the glory of the Ikshvakus. To harm none was his delight and he was high-minded and compassionate, a true hero of his race that found its splendour and the growth of its prosperity in him. Clad in all the insignia of royalty and majesty, that lion among kings, renowned in the four regions, shed the felicity he enjoyed over all. His beloved eldest son, whose countenance was as bright as the moon, was called Rama, possessor of a keen intellect and the most skilled of archers. Faithful to his vows, the defender of his people, the protector of all beings, upholder of justice, he was the scourge of his foes.", "\u201cAt the command of his aged sire, his word his bond, that hero accompanied by his consort and his brother was banished to the forest. Whilst giving himself up to the chase in that vast solitude, he slew large numbers of valiant titans who were able to change their form at will.", "When Ravana learnt that he had destroyed Janasthana and killed Khara and Dushana, he in fury, bore Janaki away, having lured her lord far into the forest by the aid of Marica in the form of a deer.", "\u201cWhilst searching everywhere to discover the divine and irreproachable Sita, Rama found a friend in the forest, the Monkey Sugriva, Bringing about the destruction of Bali, Rama, the conqueror of hostile cities, conferred the monkey kingdom on the magnanimous Sugriva and by his decree, thousands of monkeys, able to change their form at will, set out to search for that goddess in every region. I am one of those who, at the instance of Sampati, crossed the sea four hundred miles in width, on account of that large-eyed beauty. Hearing of her comeliness, her grace and distinguishing characteristics from Rama, I have been enabled to find her at last.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, that bull among monkeys fell silent.", "And Janaki was extremely astonished, hearing that speech and brushing aside her lovely tangled locks which concealed her face, she looked up into the Shingshapa tree.", "Hearing the words of that monkey, Sita glanced enquiringly to the four quarters and other regions, whilst an extreme delight flooded her whole being as she remembered Rama. Then, glancing from side to side and up and down, she espied the son of Vata, who resembled the rising sun, that minister of the King of the Monkeys of incomparable wisdom.", "Beholding that monkey of pleasing speech, clad in white raiment, resembling a flash of lightning, crouching concealed among the branches, bright as a cluster of Ashoka flowers and like gold refined in the crucible, Sita was greatly agitated.", "Observing that foremost of monkeys of humble mien, Maithili said to herself in extreme surprise: \u201cAh! What a terrible looking monkey, unacceptable and hideous to behold.\u201d Thinking thus, her fears increased and she broke into countless plaintive lamentations. Then the lovely Sita cried out in her terror: \u201cO Rama, O Rama, O Lakshmana!\u201d and the voice of that virtuous princess grew fainter and fainter till, casting her eyes on that excellent monkey once more, who had assumed a reverent attitude, Maithili said to herself: \u201cIt must be a dream.\u201d", "Observing the face of that Indra among Monkeys with its deep scars as has been described and, looking on that excellent ape, the most honourable son of the Wind, the first of the wise, Sita lost consciousness and became like one dead. Thereafter, slowly regaining her senses, she said to herself: \u201cThis vision of a monkey is condemned by the scriptures and is an inauspicious dream! Can all be well with Rama, who is accompanied by Lakshmana and my father King Janaka? Yet it can be no dream for, in the grief and misfortune that overwhelms me, I am no longer able to sleep and, far from him whose countenance resembles the full moon, no joy remains for me. Through constantly thinking and calling on Rama, I imagine I hear and see only those things which are related to Rama. For my love is a torment, my whole being flows towards him, ever absorbed in his rememberance I see and hear him alone. Is it an illusion? This is what perturbs me and makes me uneasy. I deem this to be but a phantom of the mind yet thinking thus, I still behold it, while an imaginary object can never have a form and he who is thus addressing me has a distinct form. Salutations to Vacaspati who is accompanied by the God who bears the Thunderbolt! Salutations to Svyambhu and the God who partakes of offerings! May they grant that the creature who has spoken in my presence, be real and not illusory 1\u201d", "Slipping down from the. tree, Hanuman, whose face was the colour of coral, attired in a humble guise, approached Sita and that mighty son of the Wind with joined palms addressed her in gentle tones, saying:", "\u201cWho art you, O Lady, whose eyes resemble lotus petals, who, wearing a soiled silken garment art supporting thyself by the branch of the tree? O Irreproachable One, why are tears of suffering falling from thine eyes, that resemble the lotus, as water flows from a broken vessel? O Fair One, who art you among the Celestials, Titans, Nagas, Gandharvas, Rakshas, Yakshas and Kinneras? Or do the Rudras claim that you are born of them or the Wind-gods or the Vasus, O Lady of exquisite features? To me you appearest to be of divine origin. Art you Rohini, foremost and most brilliant of stars, who, separated from the moon has fallen from the abode of the immortals? Or art you the lovely dark-eyed Arundhati, who has fled in wrath or in pride from her lord, Shri Vasishtha? Is it for a son, a father, a brother or a husband, whose departure from this world you are mourning, O Lady of slender waist? By your tears and sighs and your lying on the earth, it seems to me that you are not a celestial being and further you dost ever and again call on the name of a king. From the marks on your person I deem you to be the consort or the daughter of a monarch. Art you not Sita, who was ruthlessly borne away by Ravana from Janasthana? May prosperity attend you 1 From your wretched plight, thine unrivalled beauty and thine ascetic garb, I deem you to be Rama\u2019s consort.\u201d", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s words and filled with joy at the sound of Rama\u2019s name, Vaidehi answered him, as he stood beneath the tree, saying:", "\u201cI am the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, foremost among the kings of the world, a knower of the Self, the destroyer of hostile armies. I am the daughter of King Janaka, the magnanimous sovereign of Videha and my name is Sita, the consort of the highly intelligent Rama, who is endowed with wisdom. For twelve years I dwelt in Raghava\u2019s abode, experiencing every earthly delight and satisfying every desire. In the thirteenth year, the king, with the approval of his ministers, resolved to install Rama, the joy of the House of Ikshvaku on the throne.", "As they were preparing to anoint Rama as heir-apparent, Queen Kaikeyi addressed her lord, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I will neither eat nor drink of that which is served to me each day but shall put an end to my existence if Rama be installed. Let the boons that, in gratitude, you didst grant me, be redeemed and let Raghava repair to the forest\u2019.", "\u201cThe king, faithful to his bond, recollected the boons made to the queen and hearing those cruel and unpleasing words was lost in grief. Then that aged monarch, adhering firmly to his vow, weeping, besought his eldest son to renounce the throne. That illustrious prince to whom the words of his sire were more to be prized than the throne, inwardly assenting, promised to obey. Rama, ever a giver, seeking no return, truthful, never uttering a falsehood even were his life to be made forfeit, is essentially brave. Laying aside his costly attire, the highly glorious Rama with his whole heart, renounced the kingdom and gave me into his mother\u2019s keeping, but I, assuming the garb of an ascetic, quickly prepared to accompany him to the forest, for, separated from him, I could not bear to dwell even in the celestial regions. Then the fortunate Saumitri, the enhancer of his friends\u2019 delight, donning robes of bark and kusha grass also prepared to follow his elder brother. In deference to the will of our sovereign, firm in our vows, we entered the dark and unknown forest. While that one of immeasurable effulgence was dwelling in the Dandaka Forest, I, his consort, was carried away by the Titan, Ravana of perverse soul. Two months is the time fixed by him, after which I am to die.\u201d", "Hearing the words of Sita, who was stricken with grief, Hanuman, the foremost among monkeys, in order to reassure her, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Divine Vaidehi, by Rama\u2019s decree I have come as a messenger to you; he is safe and enquires as to your welfare. Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who is versed in the Veda, conversant with the use of the Brahmastra, the foremost of the learned, offers salutations to you, O Queen 1 The highly resplendent Lakshmana too, the most powerful and cherished companion of your lord, in the midst of his burning anxieties, bows before you and wishes you well.\u201d", "Hearing of the welfare of those two lions among men, Sita, trembling with delight, said to Hanuman:\u2014\u201cVerily the wise say that happiness visits a man even if it be at the end of a hundred years.\u201d", "Thereupon Sita and Hanuman began to converse with delight and mutual confidence. Hearing Sita speak in this wise, Hanuman, the son of Maruta drew nearer to her who had been overwhelmed with grief and, as he did so, she grew apprehensive and reflected:\u2014\u201cAlas! Why have I entered into converse with him? It is Ravana in another guise!\u201d Thereupon, letting go the Ashoka branch, Maithili of faultless limbs, exhausted with suffering, sank down on the earth.", "Then that long-armed monkey bowed unto Janaka\u2019s daughter, who, filled with terror, did not dare raise her eyes to him, yet, seeing him bowing humbly before her, Sita, whose face resembled the moon, sighed deeply and said to him in gende accents:\u2014", "\u201cIf you are Ravana\u2019s self, who has assumed a perfidious guise in order to increase my distress, it is a vile act. You are he, who, renouncing his own shape, appeared to me in Janasthana as a mendicant, O Ranger of the Night. O You, wearing shapes at will, it does not behove you to torment me, who am distressed and emaciated with fasting.", "\u201cYet you canst not be he whom I fear, since my heart feels delight in seeing you. If you are truly Rama\u2019s messenger, may good betide you! You are welcome, O Best of Monkeys for it is sweet to me to hear of Rama. Set forth the virtues of Rama, O Monkey, and ravish my soul, O Gentle One, as the current of a river bears away its banks. O how sweet a dream does an inhabitant of the woods bring to me so long after mine abduction! If I might only see the valiant Raghava accompanied by Lakshmana once more but even a dream denies me this delight. Can it be a dream? To see a monkey in dream does not give rise to happiness yet I am happy now 1 Is my mind not deranged or has fasting disturbed the humours of my body and caused this delusion or is it perchance a mirage? Nay, it cannot be an hallucination for I am in full possession of my senses and perceive this monkey clearly.\u201d", "Such were the thoughts that haunted Sita, as also that the titans were able to change their form at will, which convinced her that this was the King of the Titans himself. Having arrived at this conclusion, the daughter of Janaka, of slender waist, ceased to converse with the monkey but Hanuman, divining what was passing through her mind, consoled her with sweet words, enhancing her delight saying:\u2014", "\u201cBright as the sun and like the moon, beloved of all, that sovereign of the world is as munificent as Kuvera. In valour resembling the glorious Vishnu, of sweet and truthful speech like unto Vacaspati, handsome, illustrious and fortunate like the God of Love, the just dispenser of punishment to evil-doers, he is the foremost of car-warriors in the world.", "\u201cHe in whose arms the whole world takes refuge, that magnanimous Raghava was lured away from the hermitage by means of Marica in the form of a deer, thus allowing Ravana to bear you away. Soon shall that mighty hero destroy Ravana in combat with his fiery shafts discharged in anger. It is he, who has sent me with these tidings. Worn with grief at your separation, he enquires as to your welfare, as also the highly resplendent Lakshmana, enhancer of Sumitra\u2019s delight, who offers salutations to you. The king of the monkey hosts, Sugriva by name, who is Rama\u2019s friend, also pays homage to you; Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva have you ever in mind; though subject to the titans, by good fortune you dost still live, O Vaidehi.

I have come here to see you, depending on my own prowess, I am not he whom you deemest me to be. Do you renounce your doubts, and have confidence in my words.\u201d", "Hearing that lion among monkeys discoursing on Rama, Vaidehi spoke to him in sweet and gentle accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhere didst you encounter Rama and how didst you come to know Lakshmana? How did men and monkeys come to form an alliance? O Monkey, describe the distinctive characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana once again and so dispel my grief. Speak to me of Rama\u2019s grace and form, his arms and thighs, as well as Lakshmana\u2019s.\u201d", "To these questions of Vaidehi, Hanuman, born of Maruta, began to give a detailed description of Rama and said:\u2014", "\u201cBy good fortune, recognising me to be a messenger of Rama, O Vaidehi, whose eyes are as large as lotus petals, you have asked me to describe the person of your lord as well as that of Lakshmana. O Large-eyed Lady, hear me while I tell you of those marks of royalty I have observed in the persons of Rama and Lakshmana. O Daughter of Janaka, Rama has eyes like unto lotus petals, his countenance resembles the moon and he is endowed with great beauty and virtue. In radiance like the sun, in patience resembling the earth, in wisdom like unto Brihaspati, in renown equal to Vasava, he is the protector of all beings and the upholder of his race, the guardian of law and tradition and the scourge of his foes. O Lovely One, Rama is the preserver of the people and the four castes, he inaugurates and establishes the social order, he is worshipped by all like the sun and is an observer of pious vows; he knows well the proper time to pay honour to holy men and is conversant with the path of right action.", "\u201cBorn with royal prerogatives, the servant of the brahmins, learned, endowed with nobility, humble, he is the scourge of his foes. Versed in the Yajur Veda, honoured by those conversant with the Vedas, he is proficient in archery and possesses a thorough knowledge of the Vedas and Vedangas. Broad shouldered, long-armed, handsome, possessing a conch-shaped neck his ribs are well covered and muscular and his eyes are red; such is Rama renowned among men. The tone of his voice resembles the Dundubhi, his skin is smooth, his three limbs, thigh, fist and wrist are hard, and the others, long, his navel, abdomen and breast are well-proportioned and high. The rims of his eyes, his nails and palms are red, his voice and gait grave; there are three folds in the skin of his body and neck; the lines on the soles of his feet and breast are deep; his neck, back and thighs are muscular; his hair is coiled in three circles; his thumb is marked with four lines indicating his deep knowledge of the Vedas; there are four lines on his forehead, the sign of a long life; he is four cubits in height; his arms, thighs and cheeks are plump; wrists, knee-joints, hips, hands and feet are well-proportioned, his four front teeth have auspicious marks; his gait is like a lion\u2019s, a tiger\u2019s, an elephant\u2019s or a bull\u2019s; his lips and jaws are fleshy, his nose long, his face, speech, down and skin, cool; his two arms, little fingers, thighs and legs, slender; his countenance, eyes, mouth, tongue, lips, palate, breast, nails and feet resemble lotuses; his forehead, neck, arms, navel, feet, back and ears are ample. He is gifted with grace, renown, and radiance; his lineage is pure on both sides; his armpits, abdomen, breast, nose, shoulders and forehead are elevated; his fingers, hair, down, nails, skin, eyesight and intellect, clear and sharp. Raghava delights in what is just and true, he is filled with energy and is well able to judge how to act under all circumstances; he is benevolent to all.", "\u201cHis brother Saumitri, whose mother is second in rank among the queens, whose glory is immeasurable, resembles him in beauty, devotion and good qualities; he is of a golden complexion whereas Rama is dark of hue. Those two tigers among men, who yearn to see you once more, scouring the earth for you, met with us in the forest. Ranging the earth in search of you they beheld the King of the Monkeys, who had been banished by his elder brother, at the foot of the Rishyamuka Mountain that is covered by innumerable trees. We were in attendance on the handsome Sugriva, Lord of the Monkeys, who had been driven from the kingdom by his elder brother and, beholding those foremost of men, clad in bark, bearing splendid bows in their hands, that monkey fled to the summit of the mountain, distracted with terror. Thereafter he sent me out to meet them in all haste and, at Sugriva\u2019s command, I approached those two princes, those lions among men, with joined palms.", "\u201cDistinguished by their handsome features, those two heroes, being informed of what had taken place, were well pleased and I, placing them on my shoulders, transported them to the crest of the hill where the magnanimous Sugriva was to be found. There I related all to Sugriva and they conversed together and a great friendship grew up between those illustrious persons, the King of the Monkeys, and those monarchs among men. Then they comforted each other, narrating their respective misfortunes and Lakshmana\u2019s elder brother consoled Sugriva who had been banished by Bali of great prowess on account of the love of a woman. Thereafter, Lakshmana related the suffering and loss that had befallen Rama to Sugriva, who, hearing this recital from his lips, was bereft of his radiance like the sun under eclipse. Then gathering together all the ornaments that you didst let fall on the earth when the Titan bore you away, the monkeys brought them to Rama with delight, but they were ignorant of where you were.", "\u201cAll those ornaments which had fallen tinkling to the ground, and had been collected by me, I gave over to Rama, who was beside himself with grief and, clasping them to his breast, that God of divine beauty, the son of Dasaratha, inflamed with grief, with many groans bewailed his loss. For a long time that magnanimous hero lay crushed under the weight of his affliction and I addressed many words of comfort to him, persuading him to rise. Whereupon Rama with Saumitri, gazing again and again on those precious objects, gave them over to Sugriva. In thine absence, O Noble Lady, Raghava is consumed with grief, like a volcano burning with perpetual fire. On account of you, sleeplessness, sorrow and care consume the magnanimous Rama, as the sacred fires bum down a temple in which they are enclosed. The pain of your separation has shattered him as a violent earthquake shatters a great mountain. O Daughter of a King, he wanders among the enchanting woods, on river banks and by the side of waterfalls but nowhere finds delight. O Daughter of Janaka, ere long, Ramacandra will undoubtedly bring about the destruction of Ravana with all his kith and kin, and that foremost of men will soon liberate you.", "\u201cIt was thus that Rama and Sugriva entered into a friendly alliance to encompass Bali\u2019s destruction and institute a search for you. Thereupon, returning to Kishkindha with those two heroic princes, that lord of monkeys slew Bali in battle and having struck him down by his prowess in fight, Rama made Sugriva king of all the monkeys and bears. Such was the alliance between Rama and Sugriva, O Goddess, know then that I am Hanuman who have come as their deputy. When he had recovered his kingdom, Sugriva, gathering all the great and powerful monkeys together, sent them forth to every region to seek for you. Under the commands of their king, Sugriva, those mighty monkeys, equal to the Indra of Mountains, scoured the land on every side. Since that time, in fear of Sugriva, those monkeys have been exploring the whole earth; I am one of those. The mighty and illustrious son of Bali, Angada by name, set out with a third part of the army under him; many were the days and nights we spent overwhelmed with distress, having lost our way on the foremost of mountains, Vindhya. Despairing of accomplishing our purpose and the time appointed having passed, in fear of that lord of the monkeys, we resolved to give up our lives. Having searched the mountains and the inaccessible fastnesses, the rivers and waterfalls without finding any trace of you, we made up our minds to die. Thereafter we began our final fast on the summit of the mountain.", "\u201cSubmerged in an ocean of grief, Angada lamented unceasingly, reflecting on thine abduction, O Vaidehi, on the death of Bali, on our resolution to die of hunger and on the death of Jatayu. Whilst we were fasting thus, waiting for death, having given up all hope of carrying out the behests of our lord, to the good fortune of our enterprise, there appeared, a mighty vulture, the brother of Jatayu, by name Sampati.", "Hearing of his brother\u2019s death, he cried out in anger:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018By whom was my younger brother slain and where does he dwell? I wish to hear this from you, O Excellent Monkeys!\u2019", "\u201cThereupon, Angada related all in detail to him and how that Titan of terrible form destroyed Jatayu on thine account in Janasthana. In his grief for Jatayu\u2019s death, that son of Aruna told us that you wast to be found in Ravana\u2019s abode, O Exquisite Damsel!", "\u201cHearing the words of Sampati, our joy was extreme and led by him we all rose up and, leaving the Vindhya Mountain came to the shores of the sea. There a cruel anxiety seized the monkeys anew, eager as they were to find you, but I was able to dispel that sharp anguish of the monkey host, who beholding the main had lost heart. Then, removing their fear I leapt a hundred leagues over the sea and entered Lanka by night, which was filled with titans; there I beheld Ravana and saw you overcome with grief, O Irreproachable Lady!", "\u201cNow I have told you all, do you, in your turn speak to me, O Goddess! I am the messenger of the son of Dasaratha and have come here to you, to carry out Rama\u2019s purpose. Know me to be Sugriva\u2019s minister and the Wind-god\u2019s son! All is well with your lord, Kakutstha, the foremost of those bearing weapons, as also with Lakshmana possessed of auspicious marks and ever engaged in the worship of his superiors and the well-being of his lord.", "\u201cI have come here at Sugriva\u2019s command and have accomplished the journey alone. Changing my form at will, I have scoured the southern region and, in my eagerness to find you, have sought you on every side. With tidings of you, I shall by divine grace be able to dispel the grief of the monkey host, who have been lamenting on your account and my crossing the ocean will not have been in vain. I shall win renown for having found you, O Goddess and the highly powerful Raghava will rejoin you without delay, having first slain Ravana, the king of the Titans with his sons and relatives.", "\u201cMount Malyavat is the highest of mountains, O Vaidehi, and there dwells my sire, Kesarin. Obedient to the will of the divine Sages, he once repaired to Gokama and at that sacred spot belonging to the Lord of the Rivers, brought about the destruction of the Titan, Samvasadana. I was born of the consort of Kesarin, O Maithili and my name is Hanuman; I am known throughout the world for my exploits. To inspire you with confidence, I have described the virtues of your lord. Ere long, O Goddess, Raghava will certainly take you hence.\u201d", "Reassured by the proofs given to her, Sita, exhausted by suffering, recognised Hanuman to be Rama\u2019s messenger.", "Then Janaki, in an excess of joy, allowed tears of felicity to fall from her eyes fringed with dark lashes. The gentle countenance of that large-eyed damsel with her reddened eyes shone like the moon released from Rahu\u2019s hold.", "Taking him for a real monkey at last, she reflected in herself: \u201cHow could it be otherwise?\u201d", "Then Hanuman again addressed that lady of charming mien, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI have told you all, now have confidence in me, O Maithili! What more can I do for you and what is your pleasure, ere I return? When the Asura, Samvasadana was destroyed in combat by the foremost of monkeys at the behest of the celestial sages, I was born of Vayu, O Maithili, and though a monkey, I am his equal in prowess!\u201d", "The exceedingly mighty son of Pavana, Hanuman, in order to increase Sita\u2019s confidence in him, again addressed her in reassuring words, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Fortunate One, I am a monkey, the messenger of the sagacious Rama; behold this precious ring on which his name is engraved! O Goddess, it was given to me by that magnanimous hero so that you should have faith in me. Take heart therefore, may good betide you! Soon shall there be an end to your grief!\u201d", "Then Janaki, taking the jewel that had adorned the finger of her lord, was overcome with joy, as if he himself were present. Her gentle countenance with its large eyes began to sparkle with delight resembling the moon released from Rahn\u2019s hold. Blushing with pleasure on receiving this token from her lord, that youthful woman, in her satisfaction, began to look on that great monkey as on a friend and paid tribute to him in the following wise:\u2014", "\u201cO Foremost of Monkeys, verily you who have entered this city of Ravana\u2019s alone, art full of courage, valour and address. With admirable tenacity you have traversed the ocean, four hundred miles in breadth, the abode of great monsters, reducing it to the measure of a cow\u2019s hoof. I do not look on you as an ordinary monkey, O Lion among Forest Dwellers, since you dost not stand in awe of Ravana. O Best of Monkeys, you have merited associationship with me, since Rama die knower of Self has dispatched you as his messenger. It is certain that the invincible Rama would never have sent you to me without first testing your prowess. By good fortune the virtuous and truthful Rama as also the illustrious Lakshmana, enhancer of Sumitra\u2019s delight, are well, yet if Kakutstha live untouched by ill, how is it that he does not bum up the earth encircled by the sea in his wrath like the fires at the dissolution of the worlds? Those two heroes are able to subdue the Gods themselves and yet they refrain from action; I deem therefore that my sufferings are still not at an end! Is Rama not disquieted; is he not torn with anxiety on my account? Is that son of a king making every preparation to deliver me? Is he sorrowful and pre-occupied? Has he lost sight of his ultimate purpose; is he fulfilling his duty with fortitude? Is that slayer of his foes, desirous of victory, propitiating his friends with forbearance and gifts and employing the threefold means of dealing with his enemies? Does he show goodwill to his friends and have they confidence in him? Does he ally himself with those of good repute and do they pay him honour? Does that son of a king seek the favour of the Gods; does he depend on them for his power and fortune? Has Rama\u2019s affection for me decreased as a result of my living far from him? Will he deliver me from this peril? Is he not unstrung by this extreme misfortune, being accustomed to felicity and unused to adversity? Has he received frequent good tidings of Kaushalya, Sumitra and also Bharata? Is not Raghava, worthy of honour, overcome with grief at my absence? Is he reflecting on how he may rescue me? Will not Bharata, ever devoted to his brother, send out a great army led by experienced generals for my sake? O Foremost of Monkeys, will not the King of the Monkeys, the fortunate Sugriva, come to mine aid at the head of a host of valiant monkeys using their teeth and nails? Will not the heroic Lakshmana, the increaser of Sumitra\u2019s delight, skilled in the use of weapons, destroy the titans with his shafts? Shall I not see Rama strike down Ravana on the battlefield ere long with his friends and kinsfolk by means of Rudra\u2019s weapon? Is the golden countenance of Raghava, fragrant with the scent of lotuses, not dimmed under adversity, like a lotus deprived of water under the burning sun? Does he still retain his fixity of purpose, he who, for the sake of righteousness, without regret renounced the throne and on foot entered the forest with me? Neither for his mother nor his father nor for any other does he bear the love that he cherishes for me. I shall only live as long as I hear of him,\u201d", "Having addressed these words, full of meaning and sweetness to that monkey, that charming lady became silent so that she might hear more of her lord.", "And listening to Sita, Maruti, of immeasurable prowess, with joined palms paid obeisance to her and spoke again, saying:", "\u201cO Illustrious Princess, the lotus-eyed Rama does not know that you are here and for this reason has not delivered you as Purandara rescued Saci. Learning this from me, Raghava will instantly come hither with his great army of bears and monkeys and, having triumphed over the invincible ocean, the abode of Varuna with his terrible shafts, Kakutstha will rid the city of Lanka of all the titans. Even if death himself or the Gods or the mighty titans seek to bar his passage, he will destroy them all. O Princess, in thine absence, Rama stricken with grief is no longer able to find rest, like an elephant who is attacked by a lion. O Goddess, I swear to you by the Mandara, Malava, Vindhya, Meru and Dardura Mountains and all the fruits and roots, that you shalt soon behold Rama\u2019s lovely countenance with his beautiful eyes, lips like unto the Bimba fruit, and charming earrings, who resembles the risen moon. Soon you shalt see Rama on Mount Prasravana, O Vaidehi, like Shatakratu seated on Airavata. Eschewing flesh and wine, Rama subsists on the fruits and roots of the forest alone, carefully prepared by Lakshmana of which he partakes at the fifth period of the day. So absorbed is he in the thought of you that he no longer drives away flies, insects and worms from his body. Sunk in his reflection, lost in grief, he is wholly absorbed in your contemplation. Rama, the foremost among men no longer sleeps but should his eyelids dose in weariness he starts up crying: \u2018O Sita!\u2019 in gentle accents. Whenever he beholds a fruit or flower or any other object dear to women, he sighs \u2018O My dear Love!\u2019. O Goddess, that prince unceasingly calls on you, crying: \u2018O Sita\u2019, and in order find to you has resorted to every means.\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s praises, Sita was greatly delighted, but grieved also to learn of his pain so that she resembled the autumn moon entering a dark doud to re-appear once more.", "The moon-faced Sita, hearing this speech, addressed Hanuman in words, fraught with piety and sound judgment:\u2014", "\u201cO Monkey, you have revealed to me that Rama is wholly pre-occupied with my remembrance and also that he is plunged in grief, which is as nectar mingled with poison. Whether man be at the height of his power or in the abyss of sorrow, death draws him as with a cord. Living beings are unable to escape their destiny, O Excellent Monkey, behold how I, Rama and Saumitri are sunk in misery! As a wreck floating on the waters seeks to reach the shore, so does Raghava seek to come to the end of his woes.", "\u201cAfter destroying the titans, slaying Ravana and laying Lanka waste, will not my lord see me once again? Do you tell him to hasten, for at the end of this year I must die. This is the tenth month and two alone remain, that is the term fixed for me by that evil wretch, Ravana. His brother Bibi-shana made great entreaty to him to restore me, but he paid no heed to his proposals. Ravana does not look with favour on my release for death lies in wait for him, driven on, as he is, by fate. O Warrior, on her mother\u2019s request, Kala, Bibishana\u2019s eldest daughter told me of this. There is an old and trusty titan, named Avindha, full of wisdom, virtue, intelligence and nobility, highly revered by Ravana, who prophesied the imminent destruction of the titans by Rama, but that perverse wretch disregarded his salutory words. O Best of Monkeys, I still hope that my lord will soon be re-united with me, for my heart is pure and Rama\u2019s virtues are infinite. He is endowed with endurance, courage, compassion, gratitude, energy and strength, O Monkey. What foe would not tremble before him, who slew fourteen thousand demons in Janasthana without his brother\u2019s aid? That lion among men cannot be surpassed by the titan warriors; I am conversant with his powers as Saci is with Indra\u2019s. O Monkey, that sun, Rama, with his innumerable arrows as his rays, will dry up the lake of hostile titans!\u201d", "Speaking thus, Sita, overwhelmed with grief at the thought of Rama, her face bathed in tears, was again addressed by Hanuman, who said to her:\u2014", "\u201cNo sooner shall I have spoken to Raghava, than he will hasten hither at the head of a powerful army composed of bears and monkeys or shall I deliver you this very day from the grasp of those titans and these present afflictions? Do you climb upon my back, O Irreproachable Lady, and bearing you on my shoulders, I will cross over the sea; verily I am able to carry away the City of Lanka together with Ravana himself. This day, as Anila bears the sacrificial offerings unto Shakra, I shall bring you back to Raghava on the Prasravana Mountain, O Maithili! To-day you shalt behold Rama, who is accompanied by Lakshmana, preparing to destroy the enemy, as Vishnu engaged in the destruction of the Daityas and you shalt see that mighty hero, eager to behold you, on that solitary mountain, resembling Purandara on the head of the King of the Serpents.", "\u201cO Lovely Goddess, mount on my shoulders, do not hesitate and be united with Rama, as Rohini is restored to Shashanka, as Saci to Indra, or Savarshala to the Sun. I shall cross the ocean by the aerial path 1 O Fair One, bearing you away from here, none of the dwellers in Lanka will be able to follow me. I shall return as I came, O Vaidehi, bearing you through space.\u201d", "Hearing these astonishing words, Maithili, trembling with joy, said to Hanuman: \u201cHow canst you hope to carry me so great a distance, O Hanuman? This demonstrates your monkey nature! How dost you deem it possible that your little body should convey me from here to my lord, that king among men, O Monkey?\u201d", "At these words Hanuman reflected: \u201cThis is the first affront I have suffered! Vaidehi is unaware of my prowess and strength. She shall learn that I am able to assume any shape at will 1\u201d Thinking thus, that foremost of monkeys, Hanuman, the scourge of his foes, showed himself to Sita in his true form.", "In order to inspire Site with confidence, leaping down from the tree, that monkey began to expand in size and grew equal to the Meru or Mandara Mountain or a flaming brazier and that lion among monkeys, of a coppery countenance, his body like a mountain, with nails and teeth like diamonds, standing before Site, said:\u2014", "\u201cI am capable of uprooting Lanka with its hills, woods, fields, palaces, ramparts and gates and its monarch also! Take heart therefore O Queen, do not delay further, O Vaidehi! Come and dispel the grief of Raghava as also Lakshmana\u2019s.\u201d", "Seeing the son of the Wind-god grow to the size of a mountain, the daughter of Janaka, whose eyes resembled lotus petals, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cO Mighty Monkey, now I recognise the extent of your powers and your speed which equals the wind, also your radiance like unto fire. How should an ordinary monkey have reached this land beyond the infinite ocean? I know that you are able to take me from here and bear me away, but, O Foremost of Monkeys, I must consider if the consequences are to mine advantage. Furthermore, is it fitting for me to go with you? Your speed equal to the wind may render me giddy and I might fall from your back whilst you were proceeding high over the ocean. Flung into the sea filled with sharks, crocodiles and giant fish, I should certainly become the chosen prey of those monsters. Nay, I cannot go with you, O Destroyer of Your Foes and for you undoubtedly there is also grave danger. When the titans see you bearing me away, they will pursue you at the wicked Ravana\u2019s command and, surrounded by those warriors furnished with spears and maces, carrying a woman, you will be beset with peril, O Hero! Fully armed, in great numbers, those titans would pursue you, who art unarmed; how couldst you then resist them and protect me? And when you are engaged in combat with those terrible demons, O Foremost of Monkeys, I, stricken with fear, will slip from your back. Those terrible, huge and powerful titans would then end by overcoming you in the conflict, O Excellent Monkey. Or turning my head, whilst you are engaged in fight, I should fall and those wicked titans would bear me away and bring me hither or, wresting me from your grasp, tear me to pieces. Victory or defeat is uncertain in combat! If I died under the threats of the titans, O First of the Monkeys, all thine efforts to deliver me will have been in vain. Though you are well able to destroy all the titans, Rama\u2019s fame would thereby suffer decrease or the titans, bearing me away, would confine me in a secret place unknown to the monkeys or to Rama. Then, all thine efforts to rescue me will have been fruitless, but if Rama returns with you, great will be the chances of success.", "\u201cO Great-armed Warrior, the lives of Raghava, of his two brothers and of King Sugriva depend on me. Having given up hope of delivering me, worn out with grief and anxiety, those two brothers with all the bears and monkeys would end their existence. O Monkey, furthermore, being wholly devoted to my lord, I am unable to touch the body of any save Rama. When t was forced into contact with Ravana\u2019s limbs, I was helpless and without a defender and was no longer in control of my person. If Rama comes to destroy Ravana and the titans and takes me away from here, it will be a feat worthy of him! I have heard of that hero\u2019s great exploits and have myself witnessed them, nor can Devas, Nagas nor titans equal Rama on the field of battle!", "\u201cWho, having beheld him in combat, wielding his marvellous bow, endowed with a valour and strength like unto Indra\u2019s, could withstand Rama who is accompanied by Lakshmana and who resembles a fire fanned by the wind? O Foremost of Monkeys, who would seek to oppose Rama, accompanied by Lakshmana, resembling elephants intoxicated with Mada juice, showering shafts like the rays of the sun at the time of the dissolution of the worlds? O Best of Monkeys, do you bring my dear one and Lakshmana with the Lord of the Monkey Hosts, here with all speed. On account of separation from Rama, I have long been consumed with grief, now, O Valiant Monkey, make me happy once more.\u201d", "Highly gratified by Sita\u2019s words, that lion among monkeys answered thus:\u2014", "\u201cO Fair Lady of auspicious presence, you have spoken in accord with your feminine nature and with the modesty of one devoted to her lord! As a woman, it would not be possible for you to cross the sea, four hundred miles in width on my back and the plea that you have made, saying \u2018I may not touch the body of any save Rama\u2019 is worthy of you, O Goddess, consort of that magnanimous One. Who but you would utter such words, O Janaki? Truly Kakutstha shall hear from beginning to end all you have said and done in my presence, O Princess. For many reasons did I speak to you thus, O Lady, anxious as I was to compass Rama\u2019s design, and my heart troubled with feelings of affection. Further it was with great difficulty that I penetrated into the City of Lanka and traversed the ocean and debating what was meet for me to do, I addressed you in this wise. I wished to bring you back to the one who is the delight of the House of Raghu this day! It was my devotion for him and in regard for you, that I uttered those words. As, however, you are unable to come with me, O Irreproachable Lady, do you give me some token which will inspire Rama with faith in me.\u201d", "Being thus addressed by Hanuman, Sita, who resembled the daughter of the Gods, answered him in faint accents, her voice broken with sobs:\u2014\u201cThis is the most perfect token you canst take to my dear lord! Do you say this to him:\u2014", "\u2018O Rama, when we formerly resided at the foot of the Cittra-kuta Mountain in the eastern region, not far distant from where the ascetics dwelt, in a place rich in roots, fruit and water near the river Mandakini, whilst ranging the flowery groves, redolent with fragrance, you, having sported in the lake, rested all dripping on my breast. At that moment a crow, approaching, sought to peck me and I threw a stone at it; nevertheless that ferocious devourer of offerings, determined to wound me, would not leave its prey and in my wrath I removed my girdle, in order to strike the bird and my robe slipped down. On seeing this, you didst laugh at me, whereat I blushed with shame and indignation. Harassed by that crow, who was wild with hunger, I took refuge with you, and exhausted, threw myself into thine arms as you were seated there. Though I was still vexed, you didst pacify me by your laughter and my face being bathed in tears, gently dried my eyes; thus I was seen by you, greatly enraged by the crow, O Lord. Exhausted, O Rama, I slept for a long time on your breast, and you in your turn, didst sleep on mine, O Elder Brother of Bharata. Then, as I awoke, that crow approached me once more and, as I rose from thine arms, tore my breast with its beak, O Raghava.", "Thereupon, at the shedding of blood, you didst wake and beholding my breast lacerated, O Long-armed Hero, highly incensed and hissing like a serpent, you didst speak thus:\u2014", "\u201cO You, whose thighs resemble the trunk of an elephant, who has wounded your breast? Who seeks to play with an angry five-headed serpent?\u201d", "\u201cThereafter, looking round, you didst perceive that crow, who, with sharp and bloody talons stood before me. That bird, prince of winged creatures, was the son of Indra and with the swiftness of the wind, it disappeared into the earth. Then you, O Long-armed Warrior, thine eyes rolling in fury, resolved to destroy that crow and, plucking a blade of kusha grass, from where you had lain, transformed it into Brahma\u2019s shaft and it burst into flame, like unto the fire of death before the bird. Hurling that fiery brand, it followed that bird high into the sky and, pursued by the fiery dart, the crow flew this way and that, thus traversing many regions and ranging through the Three Worlds, repulsed by his sire and the sages; at last it sought refuge with you, falling on the earth and beseeching mercy of you. Though worthy of death, you, O Kakutstha, ever willing to succour all beings, out of compassion, spared him.", "Then, speaking unto the one who was exhausted and distressed, you didst say:\u2014", "\u201cThis weapon of Brahma may never remain ineffective, therefore say what is now to be done?\u201d", "Then the crow answered:\u2014\u201cI will give up my right eye,\u201d whereupon Ramacandra destroyed the right eye of that crow. Having sacrificed the right eye, his life was spared and, paying obeisance to Rama, as also to King Dasaratha, the crow, delivered by that warrior, returned to his abode. O You, who, on my behalf, didst discharge the Brahma-weapon, even at a crow, why dost you leave him who bore me away, unpunished? O Foremost of Men, show your compassion to me and inspire me with hope. I am conversant with your great energy, thine immense endurance, thine amazing strength, thine irresistible power unfettered by the limitations of time and space, incapable of being disturbed, you who art deep like the ocean, lord of the earth and the equal of Vasava himself!

Full of deference for the aged, dignified and brave, measured in speech, the foremost of those dear unto that king\u2019s son and worthy of his father-in-law, he who even undertakes these tasks to which he is not equal, whose presence causes Rama to forget his sire, who is dearer to him than I; Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, to him do you offer obeisance from me and repeat my words to him.

Seeing that jewel, Rama will instantly believe your words.\u201d", "Receiving the marvellous pearl, the Prince of the Monkeys inclined his head to that exalted one and prepared to depart.", "Beholding that foremost of monkeys expanding his form and, charged with energy, preparing to leap, her face bathed in tears, in a voice choked with sobs, Sita said to him:\u2014", "\u201cO Hanuman, do not fail to offer my good wishes for their welfare to those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who resemble two lions and to Sugriva also and his court. Do that which will cause the long-armed Raghava to deliver me from this ocean of affliction, where I am held prisoner. On your return, when you are near him, tell him of my harsh and bitter affliction and the threats of the titans! May prosperity attend you, O Chief of the Monkeys.\u201d", "Having received these instructions from the princess, the monkey, his purpose accomplished, exceedingly exultant, reflecting that little remained for him to do, had already crossed the northern region in thought.", "Having been honoured by Sita, the monkey, leaving that place, began to reflect on what little remained for him to do since he had discovered that dark-eyed Princess.", "Dismissing the three means to success, the fourth now appeared to him as appropriate and he reflected in himself: \u201cBecause of their nature, one may not enter into negotiation with the titans nor do gifts avail with the wealthy; one is unable to sow dissension among those who are proud of their strength, there remains therefore prowess as applicable here. In these circumstances, valour is the only resource. When these titans see the foremost of their warriors fail in combat, their martial ardour will be subdued. He who accomplishes his main purpose and compasses innumerable other engagements without jeopardising the original enterprise, is a skilful messenger. He who employs all his resources to execute a minor task, has no sagacity, but the one who uses countless means with the minimum effort, is wise. Though my mission has been fulfilled, yet if, returning to the abode of the King of the Monkeys, I have ascertained the strength of the foe and ourselves in the field, I shall have truly carried out his commands. How shall I act so that my presence here proves fruitful? How can I provoke an encounter with the titans and what can I do so that that Ten-necked One will be made to measure his strength with mine own? Coming face to face with Dashagriva on the field accompanied by his counsellors, his army and charioteer, I shall easily read his intentions and then take my leave.", "\u201cI shall now proceed to lay waste this magnificent grove, resembling the Nandana Gardens, that ravishes the eye and where every variety of tree and creeper, is found, as the forest fire consumes the dead trees and this destruction will incite Ravana\u2019s fury. Thereafter the King of the Titans will call upon his immense army furnished with tridents and iron pikes, and the horsemen, chariots and elephants, of which it is composed, and a formidable struggle will ensue. Then I shall fight with all my strength against those titans and having defeated the assembled forces of Ravana, I shall return safely to the King of the Monkeys.\u201d", "Thinking thus, Maruti, like a raging tempest, with immense energy began to root up the trees with his powerful and sinuous thighs, breaking them down, as also the creepers of that grove, where the trumpeting of maddened elephants could be heard.", "With its trees uprooted, its foundations shattered, the crests of the hills broken away and all that was fair laid waste, the copper-tinted buds, the trees and creepers withering away, that grove appeared as if a fire had consumed it and the flowering sprays blown hither and thither, resembled women with their robes in disarray. With its grassy dells and charming pavilions ruined, tiger, deer and birds emitting cries of fear and the edifices crumbling, that great demesne was bereft of beauty. And that grove, belonging to the women of the inner apartments, where they were wont to sport, with its avenues of Ashoka trees and its creepers, now laid waste by that monkey, was transformed by him into a heap of ruins.", "Then having given that powerful lord of the earth cause for severe displeasure, that monkey, eager to fight against those countless valiant titans single-handed, stationed himself at the gate, blazing with effulgence.", "Meanwhile the cries of birds and the crash of falling trees, struck terror into the hearts of the inhabitants of Lanka. Wild beasts and birds fled hither and thither in terror on every side and inauspicious omens appeared.", "Waking from sleep, those grim-visaged titan women beheld the grove devastated by that mighty and heroic monkey and, in order to inspire them with fear, that long-armed one, full of energy, began to increase in size and they, observing that immense ape, as high as a hill, of unimagined power, enquired of Janaka\u2019s daughter, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWho is this being? From whence and wherefore has he come hither? Why did he converse with you? Tell us, O Large-eyed Lady, have no fear O Dark-eyed Lovely One.\u201d", "Thereupon, the virtuous Sita, of faultless limbs, answered them saying:\u2014\u201cSince the titans are able to change their form at will, by what means should I be able to recognise them? You know what he is and what he is about 1 Without doubt, serpents know the secret of the serpent\u2019s tail! As for me, I am terrified nor do I know what he is but believe him to be a titan, who has come hither, able to change his form at will.\u201d", "Hearing Vaidehi\u2019s words, the titan women fled with all speed, a few only remaining, whilst some hastened to inform Ravana of what had taken place.", "Thereafter those female titans of hideous aspect, approached the King of the Titans and informed him of that monstrous and formidable monkey in the Ashoka grove, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO King, there is a monkey of immense size, endowed with immeasurable strength, who, having held converse with Sita, remains there. We besought the daughter of Janaka whose eyes resemble a doe\u2019s, to inform us who this monkey was but she would not disclose it. It may be that he is an emissary of Indra or Kuvera or even of Rama himself, who is anxious to discover where Sita is. This being of strange aspect, has completely destroyed your wonderful pleasure garden that was filled with beasts of every kind. There is not a single quarter that has not been laid waste by him, save the place where the divine Janaki abides, whether to preserve her or for reasons of exhaustion, we know not, but since he is a stranger to fatigue, we deem it is on account of this woman. And the Ashoka tree, covered with buds and lovely foliage, under the shade of which Sita is sheltering, has been spared by him. It behoves you to inflict some severe penalty on this formidable being, who has held converse with Sita and destroyed the grove. O Lord of the Hosts of Titans, who would dare to converse with her for whom thine heart yearns without suffering death?\u201d", "Hearing the words of the demons, Ravana, the King of the Titans, his eyes rolling in rage, flamed up like a funeral pyre and, in his wrath tears fell from his eyes like drops of burning oil from a lighted lamp.", "Then that mighty monarch ordered those titans named Kinkaras, whose strength equalled his own, to seize Hanuman whereupon eighty thousand of those retainers speedily issued from the palace, bearing maces and iron hooks in their hands. Possessing huge stomachs and large teeth, formidable to look upon, filled with valour and martial ardour, they were all burning to lay hold of that monkey. Approaching Hanuman who was standing at the gate ready to fight, those powerful titans rushed upon him like moths on a flame. Equipped with maces of different kinds and gold-encircled bracelets, with arrows bright as the sun, hammers, axes, spears, darts and lances, they surrounded Hanuman and began their attack. Then he, full of strength and courage, resembling a hill, lashing his tail, began to roar, waving it to and fro, and expanding in size, that son of the Wind-god filled Lanka with his bellowing. On account of the noise of the swishing of his tail and his roaring, the birds began to fall from the air and he proclaimed in a loud voice:\u2014\u201cVictory to the mighty Rama and the valiant Lakshmana! Victory to Sugriva, protected by Raghava! I am the servant of the Sovereign of Koshala, Rama, of imperishable exploits, I am Hanuman, the destroyer of hostile armies, the offspring of Maruta. A thousand Ravanas cannot stand before me in combat, when I crush them beneath a myriad trees and rocks! Under the very eyes of the titans, I shall destroy the City of Lanka and, paying obeisance to Maithili, depart, my purpose being accomplished I\u201d", "On hearing his shouts, the titans were seized with terror and they beheld him standing aloft like a great evening cloud and, knowing now that that monkey had been despatched by his master, under the command of their lord they began to assail him on all sides with every kind of formidable weapon.", "Surrounded by those warriors, that mighty monkey seized hold of an iron bar that stood near the gate, and lifting it, struck those Rangers of the Night, and he appeared like Vinata\u2019s offspring carrying away a struggling serpent. Grasping the weapon, that valiant monkey began to destroy those demons, moving here and there in the air, as Indra of a thousand eyes crushed the Daityas with his thunderbolt.", "Having slain the titans, that heroic and powerful son of Maruta, thirsting for combat, stationed himself at the gate.", "Thereafter the few titans, who had escaped, informed Ravana of the destruction of his servants and, hearing that a mighty host of demons had been slain, the king, his eyes rolling in wrath, commanded the son of Prahasta, who was endowed with matchless courage, invincible in battle, to go forth.", "Having slain the Kinkaras, Hanuman, reflecting awhile, thought to himself:\u2014\u201cI have laid waste the grove but I have not destroyed the sacred temple, I shall now demolish this sanctuary.\u201d", "Thinking thus, the son of Maruta, displaying his prowess, bounded to the temple that was as high as the peak of Mount Meru, and scaling that edifice, that resembled a mountain, that chief of the monkeys, manifested a great effulgence, equal to the radiance of the sunrise. Thereafter he began to destroy that lofty sanctuary which shone with a glory equal to the Pariyatra Mountain. Assuming immense proportions, the illustrious son of Maruta, in his intrepidity, caused Lanka to tremble, filling it with his roaring and, at that terrifying and deafening clamour, the birds and the guardians of the temple, fell to the ground, their senses overcome.", "Thereupon Hanuman cried out: \u201cVictory to Rama, skilled in the use of weapons and to the courageous Lakshmana! Victory to King Sugriva, Rama\u2019s henchman! I am Hanuman, the destroyer of hostile armies, son of Maruta, and the servant of Rama, King of Koshala, of immortal exploits! When I hurl down trees and rocks, not even a thousand Ravanas can withstand me in combat. Having destroyed the City of Lanka and paid my obeisance to the daughter of the King of Mithila, my purpose fulfilled, I shall depart.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, the colossal leader of the monkeys, standing on that edifice, emitted a roar and the hideous clamour struck terror into the hearts of the titans.", "In consequence of that great tumult, a hundred temple guards sallied forth, bearing every kind of weapon, dart, scimitar, arrow and axe; and surrounding Maruti struck him with clubs and bars encircled with golden bands. Hurling themselves on that excellent monkey with arrows bright as the sun, that host of titans resembled a mighty whirlpool in the Ganges.", "Thereat the son of the Wind, the mighty Hanuman, waxing wrath, taking on a formidable aspect and tearing up from that sanctuary a huge pillar plated with gold, which emitted a hundred rays, spun it round rapidly with great energy, so that the fire generated therefrom set the temple ablaze. Seeing that monument in flames, the leader of monkeys having despatched a hundred titans, resembled Indra slaying the demons with his thunderbolt and, standing in space, he cried out exultingly:\u2014", "\u201cThousands of leaders of monkeys, resembling myself, valiant and brave, are scouring the whole earth under Sugriva\u2019s command. Among these, some are as strong as elephants, others ten times as strong, some have the energy of a thousand elephants, some of a whole herd and some have the strength of the wind, while a few possess a strength that may not be measured. Such are the monkeys, armed with teeth and claws, that in hundreds and thousands and millions, will accompany Sugriva when he comes to exterminate you all. Then neither the city of Lanka nor any of you nor Ravana himself will survive, since they have incurred the wrath of that hero of the House of Ikshvaku.\u201d", "Under the order of the King of the Titans, the valiant son of Prahasta, Jambumalin of large teeth, went out bearing his bow. Wearing garlands and red attire with a crown and brilliant ear-rings, that invincible warrior of immense stature, rolling his eyes ferociously drew his great bow, furnished with shining arrows, equal to Indra\u2019s, with a noise like thunder. Then the entire sky and the four quarters at once re-echoed to the sound of the stretching of that bow.", "Beholding him advance in a chariot yoked to asses, Hanuman, endowed with great vigour, emitted cries of exultation. Thereat the highly powerful Jambumalin riddled him with whetted shafts, piercing the face of that leader of monkeys with a crescent-shaped arrow, his head with one furnished with plumes and his arms with ten having iron tips. Struck by those arrows, his coppery countenance shone like an autumn cloud lit by the rays of the sun and his ruddy face, stained with vermilion, resembled a red lotus in the sky, sprinkled with drops of gold.", "Wounded by those shafts, that mighty monkey was enraged and seeing a great rock of vast size lying near, he raised it up and hurled it against his adversary with violence, who countered it with ten of his shafts. Perceiving this feat brought to nought, Hanuman, in fury, tore up a mighty Sala tree and began to whirl it in the air, whereupon the highly powerful Jambumalin, seeing that great monkey spinning the Sala tree, let loose innumerable shafts, severing it with four arrows and piercing the arms of that monkey with five others, his belly with a further dart, thereafter piercing him between the breasts with ten more.", "His body, covered with darts, a prey to violent anger, Hanuman, seizing a club, spun it with extreme velocity, allowing it to fall on the huge chest of his adversary, whereupon neither his head, arms, thighs, bow, his chariot, his steeds nor arrows could be distinguished, and that mighty car warrior, Jambumalin, dropped to the earth, like an oak that has been felled, his limbs and ornaments crushed.", "Then Ravana, hearing that Jambumalin had been slain, as also the powerful Kinkaras, was overcome with wrath. Rolling his eyes inflamed with fury, that Lord of the Titans instantly issued a command that the sons of his ministers, who were endowed with exceeding valour and strength, should go forth to the attack.", "Then under the command of that Indra of Titans, the sons of his ministers, seven in number, resembling the fire in splendour, set out from the palace. Escorted by a large army, famished with bows, fall of energy, skilled in the use of weapons, they, the flower of warriors, were each burning for victory. Mounted in great chariots plated with gold, surmounted by banners, yoked to horses, they created a noise resembling thunder. Of unequalled courage, stretching their bows inlaid with refined gold, like unto flashes of lightning athwart the clouds, those warriors sallied forth.", "Their mothers nevertheless, knowing of the death of the Kinkaras, were overcome with anxiety as also their friends and kinsfolk.", "And, exhorting one another, clad in golden armour, they rushed on Hanuman, who stood erect at the gate. From their thundering cars, they loosed innumerable shafts like clouds in the rainy season, and, covered by that hail of missiles, Hanuman\u2019s body was concealed, as the King of the Mountains is obscured by rain.", "Then that monkey evaded those arrows and their swiftly moving chariots by executing countless skilful evolutions in the air and appeared like Indra sporting with his archers, the clouds. Sending up a mighty shout which struck terror into the great host, that valiant monkey leapt on the titans. The scourge of his foes struck some of them with the palm of his hands and others with his feet; some he hit with his fists and some he tore with his nails, striking them down with his chest and thighs, while some fell to the ground by the force of his cry. Felled to the earth, those warriors lay dying and the entire army fled to the four quarters, filled with terror. Elephants trumpeted and horses fell slain; the ground was strewn with the broken fragments of chariots, seats, banners and canopies; rivers of blood could be seen flowing on the highways and Lanka re-echoed with fearful cries.", "Having slaughtered those mighty titans, that heroic monkey, burning with courage, desiring to measure his strength against other demons, stationed himself at the gate once more.", "Learning that the sons of his ministers had fallen under the blows of that great monkey, Ravana, with a darkened countenance, concealing his fears, formed a resolution which he deemed would prove decisive.", "Thereupon Dashagriva commanded the leaders of his forces, Virupaksha, Yupaksha, Durdharsha, Praghasa and Basakama, masters of strategy, endowed with the speed of the wind, brave and skilful warriors, to take Hanuman captive, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou Generals, who are full of valour, set out at the head of your troops with your fleet of horses, chariots and elephants and take this monkey prisoner. Approaching that dweller of the woods, exercise great circumspection and act with due consideration for time and place. Having regard to his conduct, I do not judge him to be a monkey, he being endowed with extraordinary prowess. I deem him to be a higher being and not a monkey; perchance he is an emissary created by Indra by virtue of his penances in order to destroy us. Under my command, you have all triumphed over Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Devas, Asuras and great Rishis; undoubtedly they are plotting some treachery against us, therefore seize this being by force. O Generals, let each go forth at the head of a mighty host, attended by horses, chariots and elephants and take this monkey prisoner. In former times I have seen monkeys endowed with immense energy, like Bali, Sugriva, the exceedingly powerful Jambavan, the General Nila and others, such as Dvivida, yet there was nothing alarming in their gait, their energy, their prowess, their intelligence, their conduct or their capacity to assume different forms, this, however, is some great being masquerading as a monkey. Even though the Three Worlds with Indra, the Gods, the titans and men cannot resist you on the field of battle, great efforts will be needed to lay hold of him. Nevertheless, even a seasoned warrior, desiring to triumph in combat, is not able to defend his life without exertion, for the outcome of a battle is uncertain.\u201d", "Obedient to the commands of their lord, all those valiant titans, resplendent as fire, attended by their troops, threw themselves in all haste into their chariots with sharp and pointed weapons and on to their swift steeds and elephants maddened with ichor.", "Then those warriors beheld that mighty monkey, shining like the sun that rises with its diadem of sparkling rays, and seeing him stationed at the gate, possessed of immense strength and speed, highly intelligent and brave, with his vast stature and huge arms, they were afraid and assailed him from all sides with their dreadful weapons.", "Then Durdharsha discharged five white iron, and yellow pointed arrows at Hanuman\u2019s forehead, possessing the lustre of lotus petals, and his head being pierced with those shafts, that monkey leapt into the air making the ten cardinal points ring with his cry, whereupon that powerful and heroic warrior Durdharsha, standing in his chariot with his bow stretched, advanced, letting fly a hundred arrows at once. Thereupon, Hanuman, like unto the wind driving away clouds, intercepted those arrows while coursing in the sky, and sore beset by Durdharsha,the offspring of the Wind expanded in size, emitting loud roars, and thereafter, with a great bound swooped on the chariot of Durdharsha with extreme force, like a succession of lightning flashes striking a mountain. Thrown from his car, his eight steeds mangled, the pole and the shaft broken, that warrior fell to the earth, slain.", "Then Virupaksha and Yupaksha, seeing him lying on the ground, waxing wrath sprang up and advanced on Hanuman dealing blows with their maces, striking the chest of that long-armed monkey as he stood in space; whereupon he meeting the shock of their assault, evaded their arrows and, that exceedingly powerful monkey, the son of Anila, swooped down on the earth like an eagle; thereafter seizing and uprooting a Sala tree, assailing those two titans with blows, that offspring of the Wind-god slew those two mighty and heroic demons.", "Then learning that those three titans had been slain by the monkey, endowed with great swiftness, the courageous Praghasa rushed upon him laughing scornfully and the audacious Basakarna enraged, armed with a spear, also advanced towards him. Then each from his side attacked that lion among monkeys. Praghasa assailing him with a sharp-edged axe and Basakarna with his spear and, with his body streaming with blood, his limbs lacerated by their blows, that monkey, highly enraged looked like the rising sun.", "Thereafter that heroic monkey, Hanuman, breaking off the peak of a mountain, together with its beasts, snakes and trees, crushed those titans, grinding them to dust; and having slain those five generals, that monkey proceeded to destroy the remaining host. As the Thousand-eyed Deity destroyed the Asuras, so did Hanuman, the horses with horses, the elephants with elephants, chariots with chariots, and warriors with warriors and the pathvays were choked with elephants, shattered chariots and the bodies of the titans. Having destroyed those heroic generals with their forces and vehicles, that hero, resembling Time, pausing at the destruction of the worlds, rested at the gate.", "Hearing that those five generals with their forces and vehicles had been struck down by Hanuman, the King of the Titans glanced at the youthful Aksha, who full of martial ardour sat before him; and that impetuous warrior, armed with a bow inlaid with gold, responding to his glance, leapt up like a flame that blazes forth when fed with clarified butter by the foremost of sages in the sacrificial chamber.", "And he ascended a chariot, acquired at the price of accumulated sacrifice, plated with refined gold, dressed with flags embroidered with pearls, yoked to eight steeds swift as thought, unconquerable by Gods or titans, surmounting every obstacle, flashing like lightning, of superb workmanship, able to travel through space, equipped with quivers, arrows, eight swords, darts and lances in orderly array, bound with golden ropes, shining with its myriad weapons, bearing golden garlands, rivalling the radiance of the sun and moon. Filling the firmament, the earth and its mountains with the sound of horses, elephants and great chariots, Aksha, at the head of his forces, advanced on that monkey, who was stationed on the gate.", "Coming before that monkey, Aksha, with the gaze of a lion, in which admiration and respect were mingled, measured Hanuman with his glance, who resembled the fire at the dissolution of the worlds intent on destroying all creatures. Thereafter that mighty son of Ravana, reflecting on the exceeding valour of that monkey, his prowess in regards to the enemy and on his own strength, swelled up with pride and resembled the sun at the end of the world cycle. Then summoning up his courage, enraged, he took his stand resolutely in the field, and with concentrated mind challenged Hanuman, irresistible in combat and of unimaginable prowess, directing three whetted shafts upon him.", "Observing that audacious monkey, indifferent to fatigue, accustomed to overcoming his foes and proud, Aksha took up his bow, holding his arrows in his hand. Wearing a corselet and bracelets of gold, with marvellous earrings, endowed with martial ardour, Aksha rushed on that monkey and a terrific struggle ensued which was unparalleled on earth and struck terror even in the Gods and titans. Witnessing that mighty conflict between the monkey and the youthful titan, the earth cried out, the sun ceased to pour down its warming rays, the wind no longer blew and the mountains shook; the whole firmament was filled with the sound and the ocean was convulsed. Then that hero, skilled in directing his aim, fixed his shafts and loosing them pierced that monkey in the forehead with three steel pointed winged arrows plated with gold and resembling venomous snakes.", "Wounded by those murderous darts, his eyes blinded by the blood flowing from his brow, Hanuman resembled the rising sun, having arrows for its rays. Beholding that offspring of the foremost of monarchs with his splendid weapons upraised and his marvellous bow, that valiant counsellor of the Lord of the Monkeys rejoiced and in his ardour put forth his whole strength. Resembling the sun crowned with an aureole of rays as it rises over the peak of the Mandara Mountain, Hanuman, inflamed with ire, filled with strength and energy, consumed the youthful Aksha with his forces and vehicles by his fiery glances.", "Thereupon that titan, from his bow equal unto Indra\u2019s charged with innumerable darts, let fall a mighty shower of arrows on the foremost of monkeys in the fight, as a cloud looses its waters on a lofty mountain.", "Seeing the youthful Aksha on the field, seething with wrath and filled with valour, energy and strength, furnished with arrows, that monkey shouted aloud in exultation and, as an elephant draws near to a pit concealed in the grass, so did Aksha, in the inexperience of his youth, giving rein to his fury, proud of his valour, approach that incomparable warrior in conflict. Hanuman struck by those shafts, emitted a loud roar resembling a thunder cloud and, assuming a formidable aspect, full of vigour, agitating his legs and arms, churned up the air.", "Leaping upwards, that valiant titan, raining arrows, hurled himself upon Hanuman and that foremost of titans, exceedingly skilled, greatest of car-warriors, Aksha, burning with courage, covered him with a hail of shafts, as a cloud covers the mountains with hailstones. Evading those arrows by darting between them, that heroic monkey, with the speed of the wind, swift as thought, began to range the path of the air. Casting glances full of pride on Aksha, who was armed with bow and arrows, burning to fight and, filling the sky with his countless excellent shafts, that offspring of the Windgod became thoughtful and his breast, pierced by the shafts of that youthful and powerful hero, he emitted a great shout. Recognising the skill of Aksha, he pondered on the warlike qualities of that warrior, reflecting:\u2014", "\u201cThis great and powerful warrior, like an infant sun in splendour, has accomplished deeds incapable of being performed by a boy; I am loath to slay one who has shown himself equal to every martial feat; he is high-souled, filled with valour, concentrated and able to endure extreme hardship in war, worthy of being honoured by the great Sages, Nagas and Yakshas; his strength and courage lend him a noble assurance and standing before me, he looks me straight in the eyes. Forsooth the heroism of this audacious being would shake the soul of the Gods and titans themselves. Verily he is an adversary not to be despised, his prowess increases as he fights; if I disregard him, he will defeat me, therefore I must destroy him for a spreading fire may not be neglected.\u201d", "Reflecting thus on the strength of his foe and his own, that powerful one, endowed with energy, resolved to slay his adversary. Thereafter that valiant monkey, born of Pavana, coursing through the air, struck those eight excellent steeds of immense size capable of bearing a heavy burden in combat with the palm of his hand and, that great chariot, overturned by the blow administered by the counsellor of the King of the Monkeys, its pole shattered, the shafts riven, the steeds slain, fell to the earth from the sky.", "Thereupon, abandoning his car, bearing his bow and sword, that warrior leapt into the air, as an ascetic consequent on his penances ascends to heaven on leaving the body.", "Rising into the sky frequented by the King of the Birds, the wind and the Celestials, that monkey, with a single bound, seizing hold of his legs, as Garuda catches hold of a snake, with a strength equal to his sire\u2019s, spun him round and round and threw him violently on the earth. With his arms, thighs and chest crushed, vomiting blood, his bones and eyes pulverised, his joints dislocated, his sinews torn, he fell to earth slain by the Son of the Wind.", "Thereupon that mighty monkey trod his rival underfoot, striking terror into the heart of the King of the Titans, and all the Rishis, Cakracaras, Bhutas, Yaks has, Pannagas and Suras assembled with their leader Indra, who gazed with wonder on the simian slayer of that youthful titan. And Hanuman, having destroyed the stripling Aksha, whose eyes were inflamed with blood on the field of battle, returned to the gate once more and waited there like Death at the time of the destruction of all creatures.", "The youthful Aksha having been slain by Hanuman, Ravana, controlling his agitation, filled with anger, commanded Indrajita, who resembled a god, to take the field, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou are the foremost of those bearing arms and hast afflicted even the Gods and Asuras in war; you are renowned among warriors and hast acquired divine weapons by the grace of Brahma; you are invincible in combat, even against the Maruts led by Indra himself. There is none in the Three Worlds who does not tire in battle, save you. You are preserved by your prowess in arms and your valour is your shield; being versed in the knowledge of time and place, you are exceedingly experienced and no feat is impossible for you to accomplish in the field, who art full of forethought; there is none in the Three Worlds but is conversant with thine austerities equal to mine own, as also your prowess and the strength of thine arms in combat, nay, depending on you, I have no anxiety regarding the outcome of the fray.", "\u201cIn truth I did not put the same reliance on those who have succombed that I now place in you, O Destroyer of Your Foes, neither in the Kinkaras nor in Jambumalin, the son of my counsellor nor in the five generals going forth at the head of their troops with innumerable forces, accompanied by horses, elephants and chariots nor in the youthful, dearly beloved, Aksha, slain by that monkey. O Hero, you surpassest them all, therefore, reflecting on thine own strength, with all haste act in such a manner that the destruction of the army may be avoided. O Foremost of those bearing arms, considering thine own prowess and that of thine adversary, who now reposes quietly after creating carnage among these hostile hosts, act so that his might may be subdued. Powerful forces can serve no purpose here, for great armies flee before Hanuman nor do maces avail; the speed of Maruti is irresistible and, like unto Agni, he may not be slain by weapons. Therefore, revolving all these things in your mind and reflecting on the divine quality of your bow, with the intention of bringing about a successful issue, strive with determination to overcome your foe by frustrating his attacks. Assuredly it was not my will to expose you to this hazard, O Foremost among those endowed with intelligence, yet this course of action is approved by warriors and is in accord with the duty of kings. In war one must be versed in the traditions as also in the rules of military science in order to emerge triumphant from the struggle.\u201d", "Hearing the words of his sire, Indrajita, whose prowess was equal to that of the son of Daksha, circumambulated him and inspired with martial ardour, prepared to fight. Overwhelmed with homage by his cherished companions, who had assembled there, he set out for battle. And the resplendent son of the King of the Titans, whose eyes resembled the petals of a lotus, bounded impetuously forward, like the ocean at the time of the full moon. Thereafter, Indrajita of matchless prowess, equal unto Indra, ascended his chariot, swift as the eagle or the wind, moving freely, drawn by four lions with pure white teeth.", "Standing in his chariot, that most skilled of archers, fully conversant with the use of weapons, the foremost of warriors drove rapidly to where Hanuman was to be found.", "Hearing the rumbling of wheels and the twanging of the bowstring, the delight of that monkey was redoubled, whereupon Indrajita, seizing his bow and steel-pointed arrows, versed in the art of warfare, proceeded towards Hanuman and as he advanced light-heartedly, his weapons in his hand, the four quarters grew dark and jackals set up a hideous howling. Nagas, Yakshas, Maharishis, Cakracaras and Siddhas assembled and the sky was filled with birds emitting piercing cries.", "Seeing that chariot bearing down on him, the standard of Indra unfurled, that monkey raised a great shout and expanded his body; whereupon, Indrajita in his celestial car, drew back his marvellous bow, emitting a sound like thunder and those two powerful heroes closed in conflict, the monkey and the son of the King of the Titans, like unto God and demon.", "Indifferent to danger they began to fight and that mighty monkey evaded the impetuous army of that valiant archer and consummate warrior in his great car, by executing a myriad evolutions in the air with indescribable agility. Thereupon, the heroic Indrajita, slayer of his foes, began to discharge his marvellous superbly-fashioned sharp steel-pointed and winged arrows, tipped with gold, swift as lightning. Hearing the rumbling of that chariot, the rolling of the drums together with the sound of the stretching of the bow, Hanuman leapt hither and thither and that mighty monkey, evading the rain of arrows, skilfully eluded that dexterious bowman, whose target he was, and stretching out his arms, Hanuman, the son of Anila, turning aside from those missiles, leapt into the sky. Thus those skilful and spirited warriors, exceedingly swift in motion and versed in the art of warfare, engaged in combat to the wonder of all beings. Nor was the titan able to take Hanuman unawares nor Maruti surprise Indrajita, as they hurled themselves on one another with a courage worthy of the Gods.", "Observing him unscathed although the target of his infallible arrows, Indrajita, controlling his senses, engaged in profound concentration of thought on Hanuman, and finding him incapable of being slain, he began to consider how he could be bound fast and that most experienced of warriors, full of exceeding energy, discharged that powerful weapon conferred on him by Brahma on that illustrious monkey. Knowing him to be incapable of being slain, Indrajita, skilled in strategy, bound that offspring of the Wind-god with the aid of that weapon.", "Struck by the titan with the Brahma-weapon, that monkey fell to the earth unconscious, but knowing himself to be bound by a shaft belonging to the Lord, he did not experience the least pain and though bereft of strength, that monkey bethought himself of Brahma\u2019s blessing. Then that heroic monkey began to recollect the boons conferred on him by Brahma and thinking of that weapon bestowed by the Self-create, consecrated by mantras, he reflected: \u201cI may not release myself from these bonds in virtue of the power of that Guru of the World. Further, this subjugation has been ordained by Him and must be endured by me.\u201d", "Thereupon, reflecting on the power of that weapon and the compassion of the Grandsire of the World towards him, also of the possibility of deli vet ance, that monkey submitted himself to Brahma\u2019s decree.", "He thought: \u201cThough made fast by this weapon, I experience no fear; the Grandsire of the World, Mahendra and Anila will protect me; in sooth I deem it to be to mine advantage to fall into the hands of the titans and thus come face to face with their great king, therefore let mine enemies take me captive!\u201d", "Having thus resolved, that destroyer of his foes, full of circumspection, lay motionless and being ruthlessly pinioned by the titans, he responded to their threats and abuses by leonine roars. Beholding that subduer of his foes lying motionless, the titans bound him with plaited ropes of hemp and bark and he willingly allowed himself to be tied and insulted by his foes in order that he might converse with the King of the Titans, should he, out of curiosity, desire to see him. Bound with ropes, the monkey was no longer under the sway of the Brahma-weapon, for, he being secured by other bonds, it was rendered void. Beholding that excellent monkey bound with bark, the valiant Indrajita recognised him to be freed from that supernatural weapon and became pensive, saying aloud:\u2014", "\u201cAlas, those titans have rendered my exploit useless, not being conversant with the power of mantras and that Brahmaweapon being rendered void, no other is effective, thus we are all placed in a great predicament for this weapon may not be loosed twice.\u201d", "Though delivered from the power of that weapon, Hanuman betrayed it by no sign, despite the suffering caused by the fetters that bound him and he allowed himself to be ill-treated by the titans and assaulted by those cruel demons who struck him with their fists and dragged him before Ravana. Freed from the Brahma-weapon, yet bound by hempen ropes, that powerful and heroic monkey was paraded by Indrajita before Ravana and his court. And those titans related to the king everything concerning that foremost of monkeys, who resembled a maddened elephant that has been bound.", "On seeing the foremost of monkeys made captive, those warlike titans enquired saying:\u2014\u201cWho is this? Who has sent him? From whence has he come? What is his mission? Who are his supporters?\u201d and others exclaimed angrily: \u201cKill him! Bum him 1 Devour him!\u201d", "Having come some way, Hanuman observed elderly attendants seated at the feet of their sovereign and he gazed with admiration on the palace decorated with gems.", "Then the exceedingly powerful Ravana beheld that foremost of monkeys dragged hither and thither by those hideous titans, and Hanuman gazed at the Lord of the Titans, who was like unto a blazing sun in his might and glory.", "Seeing Hanuman, that Ten-headed One issued orders to his chief ministers, distinguished for their lineage and character, who stood before him and commanded them to interrogate that monkey. Thereupon, questioned in turn by them concerning the purpose of his coming, Hanuman answered:\u2014\u201cI am a messenger, I come from King Sugriva.\u201d", "Pondering on the exploits of that one of exceeding prowess, Hanuman gazed with winder on the King of the Titans, whose eyes were red with anger and who was blazing with rare and dazzling gold, adorned with a splendid diadem studded with pearls and excellent ornaments of diamonds and precious stones created by the power of concentrated thought. Attired in costly linen, daubed with red sandalpaste painted with variegated devices, he looked splendid with his reddened eyes, fierce gaze, brilliant sharp teeth and protruding lips.", "To that monkey, that Ten-Headed One, who was resplendent and of great energy, resembled the Mandara Mountain with its summits infested with innumerable snakes or a mass of blue antimony. A string of pearls gleaming on his breast, his countenance possessing the lustre of the full moon, he resembled a cloud illumined by the rising sun. With his great arms laden with bracelets, smeared with sandal paste, his fingers, like five-headed serpents covered with sparkling rings, he was seated on a superb and marvellously inlaid crystal throne studded with gems and covered with rich hangings. Women, sumptuously attired, surrounded him, chowries in their hands and he was attended by four experienced counsellors, Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva and the minister Nikumbha who stood round him like the four seas surrounding the earth; and other counsellors too waited upon him as do the Gods on their King.", "Then Hanuman gazed on the Lord of the Titans, clothed in extreme splendour, resembling the peak of Mount Meru surrounded by thunder clouds and, though suffering at the hands of those titans of dreadful prowess, Hanuman experienced extreme astonishment at the sight of that monarch and beholding the effulgence of that Lord of the Titans, dazzled by his magnificence, he became absorbed in thought.", "\u2018What splendour, what power, what glory, what majesty\u2019, he reflected, \u2018nothing is lacking! Were he not evil, this mighty monarch of the titans could be the protector of the celestial realm and Indra himself, but his cruel and ruthless deeds, abhorrent to all, render him the scourge of the worlds as also of the Gods and demons; in his anger he could make an ocean of the earth!\u2019", "Such were the diverse thoughts of that sagacious monkey on beholding the immeasurable power and might of the King of the Titans.", "Beholding that tawny-eyed one standing before him, the mighty-armed Ravana, the terror of the worlds, was seized with violent rage. Gazing on that lion among monkeys radiating splendour, his mind filled with apprehension, he reflected:\u2014", "\u201cIs this the blessed Nandi, who has come hither, he who formerly cursed me when, on Mount Kailasha, he became the object of my mockery? Or is he perchance Vana Bali\u2019s son in the form of a monkey.\u201d", "His eyes red with anger, the king then addressed the foremost of his counsellors, Prahasta, in words that were opportune and fraught with good sense, saying:\u2014", "\u201cDemand of this perverse wretch, whence he has come, for what reason he laid waste the grove and why he slew the titans? What is his purpose in entering this impregnable citadel and why did he attack my retainers? Interrogate this scoundrel concerning these matters!\u201d", "At these words of Ravana, Prahasta said to Hanuman:\u2014\u201cO Monkey, be of good courage, you have nought to fear! If it be Indra who has sent you to Ravana\u2019s abode, tells us frankly! Have no anxiety, you shalt be liberated! If you are from Vaishravana, Yama or Varuna and have penetrated into our city disguising your real form or if you have been dispatched by Vishnu, hungry for conquest, then tell us. Your form alone is that of a monkey, not your prowess. Unfold all this unto us faithfully, O Monkey and you shalt instantly regain your freedom but if you liest, you shalt pay for it with your life! Therefore tell us why you have entered Ravana\u2019s abode.\u201d", "Thus addressed, the foremost of monkeys answered the Lord of the Titans, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI am not from Shakra nor Yama nor Varuna nor am I allied to Kuvera nor am I sent by Vishnu. I am truly a monkey as I appear to be, who have come here in order to behold the King of the Titans and for this purpose I destroyed the grove. To preserve my life I fought with the titans who, full of valour, presented themselves before me. Neither weapons nor chains can subdue me, even those of the Gods and titans themselves, I having received this boon from the Grandsire of the World. It was because I desired to see the king that I suffered myself to be overcome by the Brahmaweapon. Though I was not under the spell of that weapon, yet I permitted the titans to capture me in order to further Rama\u2019s design for which purpose I have entered the king\u2019s presence. Knowing me to be the messenger of Raghava, whose power is limitless, listen to my words, which will prove to thine advantage, O Lord.\u201d", "Seeing the mighty ten-headed Ravana, that intrepid monkey addressed him fearlessly, in words fraught with penetration, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI have come here at the command of Sugriva, O Lord of the Titans I As a brother, that Sovereign of the Monkeys offers salutations to you. Hear the counsel of a brother, the magnanimous Sugriva; his words are in accord with justice, advantageous and salutary both in this world and hereafter.", "King Dasaratha, the master of chariots, elephants and horses, in splendour equal to Indra, was the friend of all and like unto a father to his subjects. His eldest son, mighty-armed, the darling of his sire, at his command, entered the Dandaka Forest with his brother Lakshmana and his consort Sita. His name is Rama and he is exceedingly valiant and ever abides in the path of virtue. His faithful consort, Sita, the illustrious daughter of the high-souled Janaka, King of Videha, vanished in the forest of Janasthana. Seeking for that princess, the king\u2019s son with his younger brother came to Rishyamuka and met with Sugriva. That King of the Monkeys promised to undertake the search for Sita and Rama agreed to aid him in recovering the monkey kingdom. Thereupon, slaying Bali in combat, that king\u2019s son established Sugriva on the throne, as lord of all the bears and monkeys. Bali, that bull among monkeys, formerly known to you, was slain by Rama with a single arrow in the fight, whereupon the Lord of the Monkeys, Sugriva, true to his vow, eager to find Sita, dispatched monkeys in all directions. Hundreds, thousands and millions of monkeys are exploring every region high and low, even up to the heavens and some resemble Vainataya and some the wind and those highly energetic monkeys course hither and thither without rest, incapable of being stayed. I am named Hanuman, the beloved son of Maruta and, in order to find Sita, I have crossed four hundred miles of sea. Having passed over the ocean, wandering through your palace, I observed Janaka\u2019s daughter.", "\u201cIt does not become you, who art conversant with what is meet and proper and hast enriched thyself by your penances, to bear away another\u2019s wife, O Eminently Sagacious One. Intelligent beings, such as you, should not commit acts prohibited by the law of righteousness which lead to ruin 1 Who, even among the Gods and titans, can withstand the shafts loosed by Lakshmana or those of Raghava in his wrath? Nay, in the Three Worlds, there is none who may affront Rama with impunity. Following the path of duty and profit, do you ponder these words fraught with advantage to you in the three divisions of time and restore Janaki to Rama, that lion among men!", "\u201cI have seen Sita and achieved that which was difficult to compass, as for what remaines to be done, Rama himself shall accomplish it. I have beheld her in thine abode, suffering grievously; you are seemingly unaware that you harbourest a five-headed serpent in your mansion. Even as food mixed with poison may not be digested even by Gods or titans, so is she. It is not worthy of you to bring to nought that merit acquired by extreme mortification, as also a long and prosperous life. You deemest thyself by your penances, to have won immunity from death even from Gods, Immortals or titans, but Sugriva is neither a God nor an Immortal nor a titan. Raghava, O King, is a mortal and Sugriva, the Lord of Monkeys, therefore how will you preserve your life? The fruits of virtue do not blend with those of vice nor does equity destroy iniquity, Till to-day you have plucked the fruit of your merits but soon you will reap the fruit of thine evil deeds. Having learnt of the destruction of Janasthana, the death of Bali and the alliance of Rama and Sugriva; ponder on these things to thine own advantage. I am undoubtedly able to destroy Lanka with its horses, chariots and elephants single-handed yet I have not received the mandate to do so. In the presence of the troops of monkeys and bears, Rama vowed to slay his foes, those who bore Sita away. Assuredly, in doing injury to Rama, even Indra himself could not dwell in peace, how much less one like you. This Sita, who is known to you and who stays in thine abode is the night of death that will bring about thine end and that of Lanka. Beware of placing your neck in the noose of death in the form of Sita. Consider how you mayest save thyself. You shalt behold this marvellous city with its palaces and highways consumed by Sita\u2019s power and the flames fed by Rama\u2019s wrath. Do not therefore abandon friends, ministers, kinsfolk, brothers, sons, servants, wives and Lanka to this fate. O Indra among Titans, follow this good counsel since it is offered to you by one who is a monkey, the servant and messenger of Rama.", "\u201cHaving wholly annihilated the worlds and their inhabitants with all that moves or does not move, the illustrious Raghava could re-create them all. Among the chiefs of the Gods, Titans, Yakshas, Danavas, Nagas, Vidyadharas, Gandharvas, wild beasts, Siddhas Kinneras or birds, in no way nor anywhere, at no time, among any beings, has any been found, who could stand against Rama whose valour is equal to Vishnu\u2019s. Since you have offered that lion among kings, Rama, this affront, your life is forfeit!", "\u201cDevas, Daityas, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Nagas and Yakshas are all unable to hold their own in combat with Rama, the Protector of the Three Worlds, O King of the Titans! Even were it the Four-headed Brahma, Svyambhu Himself or the Three-eyed Rudra, the destroyer of Tripura, or the mighty Indra, Chief of the Gods, not one of them could withstand Raghava in the field.\u201d", "Hearing this distasteful yet excellent speech of that bold and fearless monkey, the Ten-Necked One, his eyes rolling in anger, ordered him to be put to death.", "Hearing the words of that high-souled monkey, Ravana, in a transport of fury, ordered him to be put to death. This decree however, issued by the King of the Titans in his perversity on one who had proclaimed himself to be a messenger, did not meet with the approval of Bibishana.", "Knowing that Lord of the Titans to be exceeding wrath and the affair about to be concluded, that prince, firm in justice, began to consider what should now be done and that subduer of his foes, having resolved how to act, addressed his elder brother in words which were essentially true and mild, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO King of the Titans, control thine anger and with a tranquil mind hear me, extend your favour to me. Righteous monarchs, being conversant with the laws of cause and effect, do not take the life of a messenger. O Valiant Prince, it is contrary to justice, opposed to social usage, and unworthy of you to bring about the death of this monkey. You are versed in the moral code, dost recognise an obligation, canst distinguish between high and low, dost carry out your kingly duties and art aware of the ultimate purpose of life. If the wise, such as you, suffer themselves to be mastered by anger, then the study of the scriptures is only a weariness of the flesh. Be pacified therefore, O Slayer of thine Enemies, O Unconquerable Sovereign of the Titans and consider what is meet and just in dealing out punishment to a foe.\u201d", "Hearing Bibishana\u2019s words, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, in a violent rage, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Scourge of Your Foes, to slay an evil-doer is no sin, therefore I shall make an end of this worker of iniquity.\u201d", "Hearing this infamous and unscrupulous speech, essentially perverse, Bibishana, who was the foremost of those endowed with wisdom, answered in words fraught with integrity, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lord of Lanka, King of all the Titans, be gracious unto me and listen to that which embodies the significance of virtue and profit. Under no conditions is an envoy put to death, this is the unanimous verdict of the good. Undoubtedly this is a formidable adversary and he has inflicted immeasurable injury on us, yet men of honour do not sanction the slaying of a messenger though innumerable punishments have been ordained for them. Mutilation of the body, the whip, stripes, shaving of the head, branding, one or all of these may be inflicted on a messenger but of punishment by death, none has ever heard. How can a hero such as you are, whose mind is swayed by a sense of duty and who is discriminating and conversant with what is noble and ignoble, suffer himself to be overcome by anger? The virtuous do not give way to wrath! You have no equal among those who rule over a people and you are able to comprehend the import of the scriptures; you surpassed! the titans and the Gods. Invincible to the Gods and titans who are endowed with prowess, martial ardour and intelligence, you have oft-times in battie routed the King of the Celestials and other monarchs. Fools who, even in thought seek to injure you, who art a great and intrepid warrior, who hast fought with Daityas and Devas, heroic, intrepid and unconquerable, are already deprived of their lives. I see no justification for putting this monkey to death. It is on those who sent him, that the punishment should fall. Whether he be honest or not, the responsibility rests with them. Advocating another\u2019s interests and dependent on them, an envoy does not merit death. Further if this one be killed, no other sky-ranger may present himself to us, therefore, O Conqueror of Hostile Citadels, do not seek to take his life; direct thine efforts against the Gods and their leader. O You who lovest warfare, if he be slain, I see none who can incite those two haughty princes to take arms against you. It is not fitting for you, whom the Gods and titans cannot conquer, to rob the Nairritas, whose delight you are, of the opportunity of witnessing that encounter! They are devoted to your welfare, courageous, disciplined warriors distinguished for their great qualities, intelligent, renowned for their burning ardour and fine bearing. Therefore let some of these, setting out under thine orders to-day, seize those two princes and establish your supremacy among your foes.\u201d", "On this, Ravana, that sagacious Lord of the Titans, the formidable foe of the celestial realm, recognised the wisdom of the inspired words uttered by his younger brother.", "Hearing the words of his high-souled brother, spoken in consonance with time and place, Dashagriva answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou have spoken truly, the slaying of a messenger is to be deprecated, it is therefore necessary to inflict some punishment other than death on him. In the case of monkeys, the tail is unquestionably the most cherished embellishment, therefore let it be set on fire and, having been burnt let him go, whereafter his friends, kinsfolk and allies as all those dear to him shall behold him degraded and mutilated.\u201d", "Then the Lord of the Titans issued this command: \u201cWith his tail in flames, let him be led through the city of Lanka and its highways.\u201d", "Hearing his words, the titans in their savage fury began to wrap the tail of Hanuman in cotton rags and thus swathed, that colossal monkey increased in size like unto a fire in a forest fed by dry wood. And having soaked the cloths in oil, the titans set them on fire and Hanuman, filled with rage and indignation, his face shining like the rising sun, lashed out at them with his blazing tail, whereupon that lion among monkeys was secured more tightly by the assembled demons. Accompanied by women, children and the aged, those rangers of the night gathered to enjoy the spectacle and the valiant Hanuman, who was bound, began to reflect on the matter and thought to himself:\u2014", "\u201cAssuredly, though fettered, the titans are not able to prevent me from breaking my bonds and leaping amongst them creating fresh carnage, still it is in the interest of my master that I have taken this journey and it is under the orders of their lord that they have bound me, I shall not therefore resist them. From the point of view of stature, I am well able to engage all these titans in battle but for love of Rama I shall suffer this outrage. I shall survey Lanka anew, since during the night I was not able to view the fortifications, it proving too difficult. The night having passed I shall behold Lanka by day. Let them bind me anew; even though they inflict pain on me by the burning of my tail, my mind is not troubled.\u201d", "Meanwhile the titans seizing hold of that great monkey of formidable aspect who was full of courage, an elephant among apes, exultant, advanced joyfully, proclaiming his misdeeds with conches and trumpets and those demons of cruel exploits dragged Hanuman, the conqueror of his foes, through the city, he willingly submitting himself to them.", "Thereupon, passing through the titan\u2019s capital, that great monkey surveyed those marvellous palaces, covered highways, well laid out squares and streets flanked with mansions and cross roads, lanes and alleys, as also the interior of the dwellings and on the terraces and roads and along the royal highways all those titans cried out: \u201cThis is a spy!\u201d", "Then those hideous titan women informed the divine Sita of these unpleasant tidings, saying:\u2014\u201cO Sita, that red-faced monkey, who had converse with you, is being led through the streets, his tail ablaze.\u201d And hearing those words, Vaidehi remembering her own abduction, overcome with grief, having duly purified herself, called upon that God who nourishes himself on the sacrifices and urgently implored him to show his favour to that mighty monkey. And the large-eyed Sita, standing before the fire said: \u201cIf I am possessed of true devotion to my lord and have practised penances, if I have been a chaste wife, then do you prove cool to this monkey. If the sagacious Rama still has any compassion for me, if my merits are not wholly exhausted, then do not bum Hanuman.\u201d", "Whereupon Anala of ardent rays, as if communicating with that lady, whose eyes were like a doe\u2019s, blazed up and, at the same time, Hanuman\u2019s sire, in order to please that goddess, blew on that flaming tail with ice-cold breath and the monkey, whose tail was ablaze, thought:\u2014\u201cHow is it that this fire, blazing up, does not burn me? I see a great flame, yet feel no pain, even as if the snow had fallen upon it. In sooth this is a wonder due to Rama\u2019s power which I witnessed when crossing the main. If the ocean and the virtuous Mainaka acted in such a manner, in reverence for him, what will the God of Fire not do? It is on account of Sita\u2019s virtue, Raghava\u2019s power and my sire\u2019s affection for me, that Pavaka does not burn me.\u201d", "Thereafter that elephant among monkeys reflected:\u2014\u201cWhy should a warrior such as I, suffer himself to be bound by these vile titans? It is meet that I should manifest my valour and avenge myself!\u201d", "Then that impetuous and mighty monkey snapped his bonds and springing into the air uttered a shout and that offspring of the Wind-god reached the gate of the city which was as high as the peak of a mountain and where no titans were to be found. Then, he who resembled a great hill, assumed a diminutive form and casting off his fetters became free, whereupon he expanded to the size of a mountain once more. Looking about him he observed an iron bar lying at the gate and the long-armed Maruti, seizing hold of that weapon, employed it for slaying the guards. Having destroyed them, in his ardour, that one of exceeding prowess, with the burning plume of his tail resembling an aureole, looking like the glorious sun surrounded by rays, cast his eyes over Lanka.", "Surveying Lanka, that monkey, having attained his purpose, began to consider what he should do further and reflected in himself:\u2014\u201cWhat more remains for me to do to afflict the titans? The grove laid waste, those vile titans slain, a part of the army destroyed, nothing is left for me but to demolish their citadel. With their fort destroyed, it were easy to bring my labours to an end; with a little effort I can complete my task and obtain the price of my trouble. The Bearer of Sacrificial Offerings that flames on my tail must be propitiated by me, I shall therefore bum up these excellent buildings.\u201d", "Thereat, with his tail in flames, which lent him the appearance of a cloud charged with lightning, that great monkey began to range the roofs of the dwellings of Lanka. Glancing round, passing from mansion to mansion, with a calm mind he encircled those stately edifices and gardens and leaping impetuously towards the palace of Prahasta, that one of exceeding prowess in strength resembling the wind, set fire to it. Thereafter the mighty Hanuman bounded to the mansion of Maha-parshva lighting a fire equal to that at the end of the world. Then that monkey of immense energy leapt on the residence of Vajradanshtra and on those belonging to Shuka and the intelligent Sarana. In the same way that leader of monkeys burnt down the habitations of Indrajita, Jambumalin and Sumali and those of the titans Rashmiketu, Suryashatru, Hrasvakama, Damshtra, Romasha, Yuddhonmatta, Matta, Dvajagriva, Vidyujjihva and Hastimukha and the dwellings of Karala, Vishala, Shonitaksha, Kumbhakarna, Maharaksha, those of Narantaka, Kumbha, Nikumbha and the magnanimous Yajnashatru and Brahmashatru.", "That mighty bull among monkeys thereafter set fire to the accumulated treasure of those affluent titans and having passed over the other dwellings that powerful and auspicious one approached the residence of the King of Titans. Then the virtuous Hanuman, emitting loud cries, resembling a cloud at the dissolution of the world, with the tip of his blazing tail set fire to that foremost of buildings decorated with every variety of gems resembling Mount Meru or Mandara, enriched with sumptuous decoration.", "Fanned by the wind, the flames spread everywhere, casting livid gleams like the Fires of Time and those palaces, enriched with gold, decorated with pearls and gems, richly bejewelled, toppled to earth, crumbling to dust like the mansions of the Celestials, who have fallen from heaven their merit exhausted. Then there arose a mighty uproar among the titans, who fled in all directions unable to preserve their dwellings, bereft of their treasure, crying out:\u2014\u201cVerily it is the God of Fire himself in the form of a monkey!\u201d", "Some of the titan women with babies at their breasts ran shrieking from their homes and some, enveloped in flames, their hair in disorder, fell from the high balconies like flashes of lightning in the sky. And Hanuman saw various metals flowing in a molten mass, mixed with diamonds, coral, emeralds, pearls and silver, streaming from the palaces and, as fire is not sated in consuming wood and straw, neither did Hanuman weary of slaying those leaders of titans nor the earth from receiving their corpses. As Rudra consumed the Demon Tripura so did that impetuous and mighty monkey burn up Lanka and, from the summit of that mountain where Lanka stood, that dreadful conflagration kindled by the intrepid Hanuman shot forth in tongues of flame. Resembling the fires at the destruction of the world, the smokeless conflagration, lit by Maruta blazed up to the skies aided by the wind, feeding on the dwellings of the titans and their bodies like sacrificial offerings and, with the fierce ardour of a million suns, it consumed Lanka wholly as with increasing volume the fire cleaves the mundane Egg with a sound resembling innumerable thunderclaps. That fire of incalculable fury, rising into the sky, with its flames resembling Kimshuka flowers, its clouds of smoke like unto the blue lotus, looked exceedingly beautiful.", "\u201cVerily this is the God who bears the thunderbolt, Mahendra, the Chief of the Thirty or Yama or Varuna or Anila. This is no monkey but the God of Death himself who has come! Or perchance it is a manifestation of Brahma\u2019s wrath, the fourfaced God who, in the form of a monkey has come hither to destroy the titans or is it the supreme power of Vishnu, unimaginable, unutterable, infinite and unsurpassed, which, by his Maya, has assumed the form of a monkey?\u201d", "Thus did the chief titans speak, being assembled and, seeing their city suddenly consumed by fire with its inhabitants, horses, chariots, flocks of birds, beasts and trees they began to lament, crying:\u2014\u201cO My Father, O My beloved Son, O My dear One, O My Friend! Woe, alas! O My Lord, our spiritual merit is exhausted!\u201d Thus amidst, a frightful clamour, did the titans cry aloud, and Lanka, encircled with flames, her heroes slain, her warriors succumbing to the swift wrath of Hanuman, appeared to have fallen under a curse. In the midst of the tumult Hanuman with pride, surveyed Lanka bearing the marks of that violent blaze and its terror-stricken demons as Svyambhu surveys the final destruction of the world.", "Having demolished the grove planted with rare trees and slain those powerful titans in combat and burned that city filled with splendid palaces, that monkey born of Pavana rested.", "Having dispatched those titans in great numbers, destroyed the dense woods and spread the fire amongst the titan dwellings, the illustrious Hanuman became absorbed in the thought of Rama.", "Thereupon all the Celestials lauded that prince among monkey warriors endowed with immense energy, equal to Maruta in swiftness, that sagacious and excellent son of Vayu. And all the Gods, the foremost of the Ascetics, the Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Pannagas and Bhutas experienced an exceeding and indescribable joy.", "And having devastated the forest, slain the titans in conflict and burnt the great city of Lanka, that mighty monkey, seated on the roof of the foremost of buildings, spreading the rays of his flaming tail like a aureole, resembled the sun encircled with a nimbus. Then having consumed the city of Lanka, that great monkey quenched the fire of his tail in the sea.", "Beholding Lanka consumed by fire, the Gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas and great ascetics were struck with amazement.", "Seeing Lanka consumed by fire and that city with its terror-stricken titans filled with tumult, the monkey Hanuman became thoughtful and a great anxiety invaded his mind.", "He reflected:\u2014\u201cIn burning Lanka, I have without doubt done something reprehensible! Blessed are those great souls, who, in their wisdom extinguish the anger born within them as a fire is quenched by water. What evil is not committed by those who give way to wrath? In anger one may even slay one\u2019s spiritual preceptor; nor does he who is enraged, refrain from affronting virtuous men. He who gives way to wrath is unable to discriminate as to when it is fitting to speak or when to be silent; there is no iniquity that cannot be perpetrated by him. He is truly said to be a man, who, controlling himself, subdues the anger rising within him as a snake casts off its slough. Woe is me, wretched and shameless doer of evil that I am, who, forgetting Sita, have slain my lord by fire. Should that noble daughter of Janaka have perished in this conflagration, which has wholly consumed the city of Lanka, I have frustrated the purpose of my master; Sita having been burnt, I have marred my lord\u2019s design. To burn down Lanka is a trifling occurrence, but suffering myself to be overcome by anger I have cut at the very root of my mission. Assuredly Janaki has perished for there remains no corner of Lanka that has not been laid waste, the entire city lies in ashes. Since I have sacrified everything through my lack of understanding, I shall yield up my life this instant, either I shall throw myself into the fire or into the jaws of Vadava, or give my body to the denizens of the deep. Living, I am not able to face the King of the Monkeys or those two tigers among men, having marred their purpose. Through my culpable anger I have manifested my undisciplined simian nature to the Three Worlds. Woe to the unbridled passion, uncurbed and unrestrained, under which I failed to protect Sita when it was in my power to do so. She, having perished, those two heroes will die also and on their ceasing to exist, Sugriva will yield up his life with all his kinsfolk. On hearing these tidings, how shall the virtuous Bharata, devoted to his brother or Shatrughna, survive? Then on the extinction of the illustrious race of Ikshvaku, their subjects will be overcome with grief.", "\u201cUnfortunate am I, whose merits have been annulled through being false to the ties of duty and advantage, suffering myself to be dominated by a corrupting passion, thus becoming the destroyer of creatures!\u201d", "Immersed in these melancholy reflections, Hanuman recollected certain auspicious signs that he had previously observed and said to himself:\u2014", "\u201cIs it possible that that Lovely One, protected by her own spiritual merit, has happily escaped death? Fire cannot bum fire! Nay, Pavaka would not dare to approach that virtuous one, preserved by her own purity, who is the consort of one of immeasurable glory. That Bearer of Sacrificial Offerings has not burned me owing to Rama\u2019s power and the virtue of Vaidehi. How should she therefore, the object of worship of those three brothers, Bharata and the others and the beloved of Rama\u2019s heart, perish? Since it is the nature of fire to bum, he who reigns invincible as master everywhere yet who has not burned my tail, why should he consume that exalted One?\u201d", "Thereafter Hanuman remembered with wonder how the Mainaka hill had appeared to him in the ocean and he reflected: \u201cBy virtue of her asceticism, sincerity and undeviating devotion to her lord, she is able to consume fire itself but it cannot consume her.\u201d", "Pondering thus on the magnitude of the divine Sita\u2019s spiritual merit, Hanuman heard the high-souled Caranas conversing thus:\u2014", "\u201cAssuredly Hanuman has accomplished a difficult feat in igniting a fierce and terrible fire in the dwellings of the titans. The hosts of women, children and the aged are fleeing away and the tumult re-echoes as in a cavern; the city of Lanka with its towers, walls and gateways is wholly consumed but Janaki still lives, a great wonder!\u201d", "Such were the words, resembling ambrosia, which fell on Hanuman\u2019s ears and from that instant, happiness flooded his heart once more. On account of the auspicious portents, his own conclusions, the merits of Sita and the words of the saints, Hanuman was delighted beyond measure. Thereupon that monkey, having attained his end, knowing the princess to be safe, resolved to leave Lanka after seeing her once more.", "Paying obeisance to Janaki seated at the foot of the Shimshapa tree, Hanuman said to her: \u201cBy the grace of heaven I find you unharmed!\u201d", "Looking on him again and again as he stood ready to depart, Sita, inspired by conjugal affection, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cIf, O Child, you judgest it opportune, then, O Irreproachable Friend, remain here in some hidden spot to-day; to-morrow, having rested, do you set out. Your proximity, O Monkey, will make me forget mine overwhelming grief awhile. You will go, O Great Monkey and it is doubtful whether I shall still be living on your return, O Foremost of Monkeys! In thine absence my torments will increase and falling into one misfortune after another, I shall be consumed with grief and sorrow. Further, O Hero, this fear is ever present with me; how will the most valiant Sugriva or that host of bears and monkeys cross the impassable ocean or those two sons of men supported by those powerful monkeys? Three beings alone are able to bound over the deep, Vainateya, you and Maruta.", "\u201cIn the face of this insurmountable obstacle, in your consummate experience dost you see any possibility of success? O Destroyer of Hostile Warriors, you alone art competent to perform this task, you shalt attain renown by your prowess; yet, if Kakutstha, the scourge of his foes were able to lay Lanka waste with his forces and bear me away, it would be worthy of him. Therefore do that which will enable the magnanimous Rama to manifest his prowess in conformity with a warrior\u2019s nature.\u201d", "Hearing these words full of loving solicitude, reason and significance, the valiant Hanuman answered:\u2014", "\u201cO Noble Lady, that lord and foremost of monkeys, Sugriva, endowed with power, has resolved to deliver you. Attended by thousands of billions of powerful monkeys, he will not delay in coming hither, O Vaidehi, and those foremost of men, the flower of the human race, Rama and Lakshmana, coming here, will afflict Lanka with their arrows. Having destroyed the titans and their adherents, the son of Raghu, O Exceedingly Fair One, shall bear you away and bring you to his capital. Take heart, therefore, O Gentle One and await that hour 1 Soon shalt you see Rama strike down Ravana on the field of battle. The Lord of the Titans slain with his sons, ministers and people, you shalt be re-united with Rama, as Rohini with the moon. Ere long Kakutstha will appear accompanied by the foremost of monkeys and bears and, triumphing in the fight, shall remove your grief.\u201d", "Having thus consoled Vaidehi, Hanuman, born of Maruta, prepared to depart, offering salutations to her and, having comforted her and displayed his surpassing strength by rendering that city desolate, having thwarted Ravana and exhibited his immeasurabke power, Hanuman, paying obeisance to Vaidehi, intent on returning, resolved to cross the ocean once more.", "Then the repressor of his foes, that powerful monkey, eager to see his lord, ascended the foremost of mountains, Arishta, covered with dark groves of Padmaka trees, resembling a mantle which, with the clouds clinging to its sides, seemed to expand with joy under the sun\u2019s rays; the metals scattered here and there appeared to be its eyes and the solemn sound of its torrents resembled its voice chanting the Veda; the waterfalls, the singing of its song and the tall Devadaru trees caused the mountain to resemble a giant with uplifted arms, the thundering of the torrents were its cries re-echoing round about and the autumnal woods agitated by the wind made it appear as if it trembled; as the breeze whistled through the reeds, it seemed to be piping while great and venomous serpents created the illusion of its hissing in anger. With its ravines shrouded in mist, investing it with a solemn air, as if it were deeply absorbed in contemplation and the clouds moving here and there on its slopes lending it the appearance of walking; with its peaks towering heavenwards, so that it appeared to be yawning, it was bristling with escarpments and filled with innumerable caves. Planted with Sala, Tala. Kharjura, Tamala, Kama and Vanisha trees with a myriad creepers laden with flowers and abounding in herds of deer and containing innumerable streams, with countless crags, rich in minerals, intersected by rills, frequented by Maharishis, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinneras and Uragas, impenetrable on account of the thorns and briars, its caves were filled with lions, and tigers and other beasts abounded there and that mountain was furnished with trees having delicious fruit and roots.", "Then the foremost of monkeys, the son of Anila, ascended that mountain burning to behold Rama once more and, wherever he placed his foot on those enchanting slopes, the rocks crumbled and broke away with a thundering sound.", "Having scaled the Indra of Mountains, that mighty monkey gathered up his strength, desirous of crossing from the southern to the northern shore of the salty sea and, reaching the summit, he beheld that formidable expanse of water inhabited by dreadful monsters. Then the son of Maruta, with the swiftness of the wind as it blows through space, leapt from the southern region to the northern shore and, pressed under foot by that monkey, the mountain giant re-echoing to the cries of countless denizens sank into the bosom of the earth with its peaks toppling and its trees overturned. Borne down by Hanuman\u2019s prodigious bounds, trees laden with blossom fell to the ground as if struck by Indra\u2019s thunderbolt and the dreadful roar of great lions lurking in the caverns rent the skies as they were crushed by the falling mountain. Vidya-dharas, their raiment tom and their ornaments in disorder, fled in terror from that place and large and powerful serpents, filled with poison, shooting out their tongues, lay in coiled heaps, their heads and necks crushed. Kinneras, Uragas, Gandharvas, Yakshas and Vidyadharas, deserting that mountain, returned to the celestial realm and that mighty hill, measuring forty miles in extent and thirty in height, was levelled to the earth with its trees and lofty summits", "Then that monkey, desirous of crossing over the salty sea, whose shores were threatened by the tides, rose into the air.", "Like a winged mountain, with one impetuous bound, Hanuman sailed over the airy sea, whose serpents were the Yakshas and the full-blown lotuses; the Gandharvas the moon was the lily on those enchanting waters, the sun its waterfowl, Tishya and Shravana its swans and the clouds its reeds and moss; Pumavasu was the whale and Lohitanga the crocodile; Airavata the spacious island; Swati, its decoration in the form of a swan; the breezes were its billows and the rays of the moon its cool and peaceful waves.", "Unwearyingly, Hanuman swallowing up that space adorned with the sun and stars, skimmed past the King of the Planets. Cleaving the clouds and crossing that ocean without fatigue, he beheld great masses of cloud, white, roseate, purple, blue, yellow and black, looking exceedingly beautifiil and he, entering and re-emerging from them, looked like the moon, when it is lost to sight and becomes visible again. Coursing through those massed clouds in his white attire, that hero could at times be seen and again was hidden in the sky, like unto the moon. Borne through space, that son of the Wind constantly dispersed the groups of clouds, sailing on and on, emitting loud roars resembling thunder and, having slain the titans, rendered his name famous, laid the city of Lanka waste, harassed Ravana, inflicted defeat on those mighty warriors and paid homage to Vaidehi, he was now returning full of glory, across the sea.", "And that one endowed with prowess, paid homage to the foremost of mountains, Mainaka, as he sped on like an arrow loosed from the bowstring. Approaching from afar, he observed that lofty Mountain Mahendra, like a great cloud and that mighty monkey, having a lusty voice resembling thunder, filled the ten cardinal points with his roars.", "Reaching the southern shore, eager to see his friends once again, he began to wave his tail to and fro and emit loud cries and as he proceeded in the path of Supama, the clamour rent the skies and it appeared as if the firmament and the sun\u2019s disc were shattered.", "Thereupon those mighty warriors on the northern shore of the ocean, anxiously awaiting the Wind-god\u2019s offspring, heard the sound created by the thighs of Hanuman proceeding at great speed, resembling clouds blown by the wind and those rangers of the woods, who had been dispirited, heard the roars of that monkey which were like unto thunder. Hearing that clamour raised by Hanuman, those monkeys who were eager to see their friend once again, were greatly excited and Jambavan, the foremost of the monkeys, his heart exultant, addressing them all, spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cUndoubtedly Hanuman has been wholly successful in his enterprise; if it were not so he would not have raised this clamour.\u201d", "Thereupon the monkeys, hearing the violent movements of that magnanimous one, as also bis shouts, highly delighted, leapt up and in their joy, bounding from rock to rock and from crest to crest, eager to behold Hanuman, climbed to the tops of the trees waving their clean apparel.", "And the roaring of the mighty Hanuman, born of Maruta, resembled the wind whistling through a mountain gorge. Seeing that great ape, who, alighting, shone like a mass of clouds, all the monkeys stood before him with joined palms, whereupon that valiant monkey, high as a hill, leapt down on to the Mahendra Mountain covered with trees and, overflowing with felicity, he alighted on that lofty and enchanting peak, like a winged hill, whose pinions have been dipt and who has fallen from the sky.", "Then instantly all the monkeys with glad hearts began to gather round the magnanimous Hanuman, encircling him, their faces shining with joy, drawing near to him in the excess of their felicity. Then offering obeisance to him they brought roots and fruits to that greatest of monkeys, born of Maruta. In their delight, some emitted shouts of joy and the foremost of the monkeys brought branches of trees so that he might be seated.", "Meanwhile that mighty ape, Hanuman, paid obeisance to his elders and the aged with Jambavan at their head, as wdl as Prince Angada. And honoured by them all, as he had merited to be and overwhelmed by courtesies, he informed them briefly:\u2014\u201cI have seen the Goddess!\u201d Then taking the hand of Bali\u2019s son, he sat down in the enchanting grove on the Mahendra Mountain and, questioned by them, he joyfully addressed those foremost of monkeys, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIn the midst of the Ashoka grove, I observed Janaki; that irreproachable one is guarded by dreadful titan women. That damsel is wearing a single plait of hair and constantly sighs for Rama\u2019s presence. She is faint on account of fasting, stained with dust, emaciated, and wears matted locks.\u201d", "Those foremost of monkeys, hearing the words of Maruti: \u201cI have seen her\u201d, sweet as Amrita, intoxicated with joy began to shout and emitting cries of pleasure raised ululations. Some waved their tails to and fro, others raised them up lashing them or bounded to the summit and with delight touched the fortunate Hanuman, that chief of monkeys.", "And when Hanuman had spoken, Angada, in the midst of those valiant monkeys, paid tribute to Hanuman in excellent words, saying:\u2014", "\u201cFor valour and courage you have no equal, O Monkey, since you have crossed the immense ocean and hast now returned. You alone hast given us back our lives, O Great One. By your grace, our purpose accomplished, we can rejoin Raghava. O What devotion you have shown to your master 1 What prowess I What endurance! By the grace of heaven, you have seen the divine and glorious consort of Rama. By the grace of heaven, Kakutstha will abandon the grief that Sita\u2019s absence has caused him!\u201d", "Thereafter, surrounding Angada, Hanuman and Jambavan, the monkeys full of joy brought large rocks and, seated thereon, eager to hear how he had crossed the main and seen Lanka, Sita and Ravana, they waited with joined palms, their eyes fixed on Maruti.", "And the youthful Angada, surrounded by innumerable monkeys, resembled the Chief of the Gods enthroned in heaven amidst the myriad hosts.", "When the glorious and renowned Hanuman with the illustrious Angada, who was adorned with bracelets were seated, that elevated and mighty peak shone with splendour.", "Thereafter, on the summit of Mount Mahendra, those monkeys, their eyes fixed on the mighty Hanuman were filled with delight and when all those high-souled and happy monkeys were seated, Jambavan, glad at heart, enquired of the great and fortunate offspring of the Wind concerning the success of his mission, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHow didst you discover that noble lady; how does she fare there; how does that cruel Ten-headed One bear himself towards her? Do you truthfully relate all this unto us, O Mighty Monkey!", "\u201cHow wast you able to trace the divine Sita? What did she reply to thine enquiries? Having learnt all, we can take counsel as to what should be done! Do you tell us also what, on our return, we should say and what we should conceal, O You who art well able to subdue thyself!\u201d", "Thereupon, that messenger, his hair standing on end with joy on hearing these words, inclining his head in token of his reverence for Sita, answered:\u2014", "\u201cIn your presence I leapt from the summit of the Mahendra Mountain into space with a concentrated mind, desirous of reaching the southern shore of the sea. In my course, a formidable obstacle presented itself to my view and I beheld a great mountain having a golden peak, divine and splendid, which obstructed my path. Approaching the sun-like summit of that mighty mountain, reflecting: \u2018I will shatter this\u2019, I struck it with my tail and that peak which shone like the sun, broke into a thousand fragments.", "Seeing its condition, that great mountain addressed me in sweet accents, bringing as it were refreshment to my soul, and said:", "\u201c\u2018Know me, O My Son, to be the brother of your father Matarishvat, famed as Mainaka, dwelling in the deep. Formerly, all the larger mountains were furnished with wings and ranged over the earth causing devastation everywhere. Hearing of the conduct of those mountains, Mahendra, that blessed One, by whom Paka was chastised, with his thunderbolt severed the wings of those mountains by thousands but I was delivered by thine illustrious sire and that high-souled Wind-god cast me into the sea, the abode of Varuna. O Subduer of your Foes, I am willing to render assistance to Raghava, Rama is the foremost among virtuous men and is as powerful as Mahendra himself\u2019.", "\u201cHearing the words of the magnanimous Mainaka, I confided my purpose to him and he gave me leave to depart. Then, counselling me to proceed, he vanished in his human form and in the shape of a mountain became submerged in the sea.", "\u201cFor a long time I travelled onward with speed till I observed the divine Surasa, Mother of Serpents, in the midst of the ocean and that Goddess addressed me saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018You are destined by the Celestials to be my food, O Best of Monkeys, I am about to devour you since you have been assigned to me\u2019.", "\u201cHearing this, I, with humility, turning pale, made obeisance to her with joined palms and uttered these words:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Rama, the fortunate son of Dasaratha, the Scourge of his Foes, withdrew to the Dandaka Forest with his brother Lakshmana and Sita; his consort was borne away by the wicked Ravana; I am proceeding to her on Rama\u2019s behest. In this matter you should assist Rama. Having seen Mithila\u2019s daughter as also her lord of imperishable exploits, I shall return and enter your mouth, this I promise you\u2019.", "\u201cThus accosted by me, Surasa, able to change her form at will, said:", "\u2018None is able to pass by me, this is the boon I have received\u2019.", "\u201cThus addressed by Surasa, I attained the magnitude of ten yojanas and then another ten, but her mouth assumed even greater proportions. Seeing her jaws thus dilated, I instantly assumed a tiny form measuring a thumb\u2019s size and quickly entered her mouth, emerging immediately, whereupon the divine Surasa, taking on her normal shape, said to me:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Best of Monkeys, O Dear One, go, accomplish your mission and restore Vaidehi to the magnanimous Rama. Be you blessed, O Mighty One! I am pleased with you!\u2019", "\u201cThen all beings praised me saying: \u2018Excellent! Excellent!\u2019 and I again leapt into the infinite blue like unto Garuda, when suddenly, without anything being visible, my shadow was held fast. Stayed in my course, I surveyed the ten cardinal points unable to discover who held me prisoner.", "Then the thought came to me:", "\u2018What is this obstacle that has risen in my path? I cannot discern its nature!\u2019", "And as I looked down bewildered, I beheld a dreadful demon lying in the waves, thereupon that monster, laughing scornfully, addressed these inauspicious words to me, who though undaunted, remained motionless:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Whither art you bound, O You of gigantic form? Do you become my food, who am hungry, and gratify this body deprived of sustenance for a long period.\u2019", "Saying:\u2014\u2018Be it so\u2019 I expanded my body to more than the capacity of her mouth but she increased the size of her huge and dreadful jaws in order to swallow me nor could she comprehend that I was able to assume different shapes at will. In the twinkling of an eye, abandoning my vast size, I, extracting her heart, flew into the sky.", "\u201cThrowing up her arms, that cruel demon sank under the salty waves like a mountain, whereupon I heard the harmonious voices of those magnanimous beings stationed in the air, saying:\u2014", "\u2018That dreadful demon Sinhika has been swiftly slain by Hanuman.\u2019", "\u201cThat monster destroyed, I recalled to mind the urgency of my mission, and the delay that had occurred in discharging it and, after traversing a great distance, I beheld the southern shore of the ocean and the mountain on which Lanka was situated. The sun having set, I penetrated the abode of the titans unnoticed by them and, as I did so, a woman resembling the clouds at the end of the world period rose before me, breaking into laughter.", "Striking that exceedingly dreadful form, having flames for her hair, who had sought to take my life, with my left fist I thrust her aside and entered there at dusk, whereupon that one, affrighted, addressed me saying:\u2014", "\u2018I am the city of Lanka, O Warrior! Vanquished have I been by your prowess, you shalt also triumph over all the titans!\u2019", "\u201cMeanwhile I sought for Janaka\u2019s daughter all through the night, penetrating into Ravana\u2019s inner apartments, but did not find her there. Not finding Sita in Ravana\u2019s palace, I was submerged in a sea of sorrow and in the midst of my distress I saw an enchanting grove with a mansion surrounded by a lofty golden wall. Having scaled that enclosure I beheld a grove of Ashoka trees in the midst of which a great Shimshapa grew. Ascending it, I observed a thicket of golden aspens and hard by the Shimshapa tree, I beheld that supremely beautiful one, dark blue of hue, whose eyes resembled lotus petals, clad in a single piece of cloth. Emaciated with fasting, her hair soiled with dust, Sita, fixed in devotion to her lord, was surrounded by cruel and hideous titan women living on blood and flesh, as a doe encircled by tigresses. Wearing a single plait, absorbed in the thought of her lord, lying on the earth, her limbs wasted, she resembled a lotus at the advent of winter. Deprived by Ravana of the object of her desire, she had resolved to die.", "\u201cBeholding that lady, whose eyes resembled a doe\u2019s, the illustrious consort of Rama, I remained seated in the Shimshapa tree.", "\u201cThereafter I heard a great clamour mixed with the jingling of girdles and anklets, issuing from the palace of Ravana and, exceedingly agitated, contracting my body, I concealed myself like a bird in the thick foliage of the Shimshapa tree. Thereupon the mighty Ravana accompanied by his consorts came to the place where Sita was and, seeing the Lord of the Titans, Janaki of lovely hips, shrank into herself, concealing her breasts with her arms and, in great dread and extreme confusion, glancing here and there and finding no refuge, that unfortunate being was seized with violent trembling.", "\u201cThen Dashagriva, inclining his head, bowed to the feet of the princess, who was overcome with extreme grief and said to her:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Fair One, do you regard me with favour! If, O Sita, through pride, you dost refuse to honour me, at the end of two months I shall drink your blood!\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words spoken by the wicked Ravana, Janaki growing exceedingly wrath, answered with dignity:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Vilest of Titans, having uttered such a speech to the consort of Rama of immeasurable prowess, to me, the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha of the Ikshvaku line, why has your tongue not fallen out? O Vile Wretch, great indeed was your valour to bear me hence far from the illustrious Rama, in his absence! You are not even worthy to be the slave of Raghava, that invincible, loyal, courageous and illustrious warrior!\u2019", "\u201cThus addressed in harsh terms, Dashagriva blazed up with wrath like a fire on to which a brand has been cast and, rolling his eyes in rage, clenching his right fist he prepared to strike Mithila\u2019s daughter.", "\u201cThen all the titan women cried out: \u2018Hold! Hold!\u2019 and from their midst, the wife of that evil wretch, the lovely Mandodari, ran towards him and with gentle words, inspired by the love she bore him, contrived to pacify him.", "\u201cShe said:\u2014", "\u2018You whose valour is equal to Mahendra\u2019s, what need hast you for Sita? Divert thyself with me, who am in no way inferior to her or do you disport thyself with the daughters of the Gods, the Gandharvas or Yakshas. What is Sita to you?\u2019", "\u201cThereafter, that company of women raised up that powerful Ranger of the Night and conducted him back to his residence.", "\u201cRavana having departed, those titan women of hideous aspect, railed at Sita in harsh and cruel terms, but Janaki paid no more heed to their speech than to a straw, and their taunts were lost on her; and those titan women, who fed on flesh, failing in their attempts, informed Ravana of Sita\u2019s unconquerable resolution, whilst others, tired of tormenting her, giving up hope, exhausted, lay down to rest.", "\u201cAnd while they slept, Sita, devoted to her lord, gave voice to bitter lamentation in the extremity of her distress.", "\u201cThereafter, rising in their midst, Trijata spoke, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Devour me this instant, if you will, but do not lay hands on the dark-eyed Sita, daughter of Janaka, the virtuous daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha. In truth I have had a fearful dream, causing the hair to stand on end, presaging the destruction of the titans and the triumph of this one\u2019s lord. It is for us to seek the grace of Vaidehi, who alone I deem, can defend us from Raghava. Let us therefore relate this dream to her, for one who is the object of such a vision, being freed from her distress, will attain the height of felicity. By bowing low in submission, we shall earn the favour of Janaki, who alone can deliver us from this great peril!\u2019", "\u201cThereat that chaste and youthful woman, on hearing of the coming victory of her lord, rejoicing, said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018If Trijata speak truly, then indeed will I protect you all.\u2019", "\u201cObserving Sita\u2019s unfortunate plight, I became absorbed in thought and my mind was perturbed. Then I cast about as to how I might find some means of speaking to Janaki and I began to extol the race of Ikshvaku.", "\u201cHearing the words I uttered embellished with the praises of those Rajarishis, that exalted lady, her eyes suffused with tears, enquired of me saying:\u2014", "\u2018Who art you; how and on whose behest hast you come hither? From whence comes thine attachment to Rama? It behoves you to relate all to me.\u2019", "\u201cListening to her speech, I made answer to her in this wise:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Goddess! Rama, your consort, has found an ally endowed with supreme prowess, named Sugriva, who is the redoubtable and powerful King of the Monkeys. Know me to be his servant, Hanuman, who has come hither to you, dispatched by your lord of imperishable exploits. O Illustrious Lady, that highly effulgent son of Dasaratha, foremost of men, has sent this ring as a token to you. O Queen, what is your behest? Shall I bring you back to Rama and Lakshmana on the northern shore of the ocean?\u2019", "\u201cHearing this, Sita, the delight of Janaka, reflected within herself awhile and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Suffer Raghava to destroy Ravana and himself carry me hence.\u2019", "Inclining my head to that noble and irreproachable lady, I requested some token from her which might enhance the delight of Raghava, whereupon Sita said to me:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Take this excellent jewel for which you shalt be highly regarded by that One of mighty arms.\u2019", "\u201cThereupon, that princess of lovely limbs gave me a marvellous jewel and in a voice strangled with sobs, bade me farewell.", "I bowed to that daughter of a king with deep respect and, circumambulating her began to consider returning home, but she, having searched her heart, addressed me once again, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Hanuman, do you relate my story to Raghava in such wise that those two heroes, Rama and Lakshmana, will come here instantly accompanied by Sugriva, or else, having but two months to live, Kakutstha will see me no more, like one without a protector.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these dreadful words, a wave of anger surged over me and I instantly resolved on what I should do. Thereupon, expanding my body to the size of a mountain, burning to fight, I laid waste the grove. Then all the beasts and birds began to flee away in fear and those terrible titan women awoke and beheld the devastation.", "Observing me, they all assembled and instantly ran in haste to inform Ravana, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Valiant Sovereign, this thine inviolable grove has been destroyed by a wretched monkey who sets your prowess at nought. Slay that perverse creature instantly, who thus affronts you, lest he escape!\u2019", "\u201cOn this, the King of the Titans, Ravana, sent out innumerable warriors called Kinkaras and eighty thousand of those titans, armed with spears and maces, were slain by me in the grove with an iron bar. Then a few, who survived, quickly went to Ravana to inform him of the destruction of his troops.", "\u201cThereupon I resolved to destroy the marvellous palace with its monument and slew the guards stationed there. In my fury I laid this building, the ornament of Lanka, low, whereupon Ravana sent out the son of Prahasta, Jambumalin with a company of titans of grim and fearful aspect.", "\u201cWith my formidable mace I slew that mighty and skilful warrior with his retinue and Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, on hearing this, dispatched the highly powerful sons of the ministers followed by a regiment of infantry but with my iron bar I sent them all to the abode of death.", "\u201cLearning that, despite their ardour, I had struck down the sons of his ministers on the field, Ravana quickly ordered five of his heroic commanders to set out at the head of their troops, but I slew them all, whereupon Dashagriva sent out his highly powerful son, Aksha, with countless titans, to engage me in combat. Then that youthful son of Mandodari, a skilful warrior sprang into the air and I seized him by the feet, whirling him round and throwing him on the earth.", "\u201cThereat the ten-necked Ravana, full of ire, hearing of the downfall of Aksha, sent his second son Indrajit, full of courage and martial ardour, against me and I, rendering the prowess of all those titans ineffectual, experienced extreme delight. Nevertheless, that long-armed warrior in whom Ravana had supreme confidence, inflamed with wine, continued to fight at the head of his warriors.", "\u201cAnd he, realising that I was invincible and seeing his forces routed, made me captive by aid of the Brahma-weapon, whereupon the titans bound me with ropes and taking hold of me brought me before Ravana.", "Then that One of vicious soul entered into conversation with me and enquired of me regarding my coming to Lanka and why I had slain the titans, whereto I replied:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I have done all this for Sita! To find her I came hither 1 I am the son of Maruta, the monkey Hanuman! Know me to be Rama\u2019s messenger and the minister of Sugriva. It is to carry out Rama\u2019s design that I stand before you!

It is therefore fitting that we should assist him by every means and by virtue of this contract I have despatched Hanuman unto you as envoy. Do you therefore speedily return Sita to Rama, ere those valiant monkeys overthrow your forces. Who is not conversant with the monkeys\u2019 prowess, whose aid has been solicited even by the Gods themselves?\u2019", "\u201cSpeaking thus to Ravana, he bent his furious glances on me as if he would consume me and that ruthless titan ordered me to be put to death, being unaware of my power.", "\u201cMeanwhile his high-souled brother Bibishana, endowed with great sagacity, interceded for me in the following wise; saying:", "\u2018O You Foremost of the Titans, abandon your resolve, which is not in accord with the royal code. The death of an envoy is not sanctioned by royal tradition, O Titan. A messenger simply communicates the mandate of his master I O You of incomparable prowess, there is no warranty for his destructon, yet, if his guilt be considerable, he may be mutilated.\u2019", "\u201cAt these words of Bibishana, Ravana issued this command to the demons: \u2018Set fire to the monkey\u2019s tail!\u2019", "\u201cOn this behest, those titans wrapped my tail in hemp and cotton rags and they, in well-wrought armour struck me with their clenched fists and sticks and set fire to my tail. Bound and fettered with ropes by the titans, I submitted to it, resolving to set fire to the city. Thus pinioned and enveloped in flames, those warriors, shouting, led me along the royal highway to the gates of the city. There, contracting my body I assumed a diminutive form and casting off my bonds, I seized an iron bar and assailed those titans, thereafter with one bound vaulting the gate, I rapidly burnt down the whole city and its gates and towers with my flaming tail, resembling the fire that consumes all beings at the end of the world.", "\u201cSeeing Lanka in flames I reflected with anxiety that Janaki must without doubt have perished since there was no comer of the city that had not been reduced to ashes. Thinking thus, overcome with grief, I overheard the Caranas saying in auspicious accents:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Janaki has not perished in the flames!\u2019 and hearing these wonderful words, proclaimed by their enchanting voices, I regained my courage. I was thereafter reassured by many auspicious signs, that Janaki had been saved from the flames and though my tail was on fire, I had not been consumed! My heart was filled with joy and the wind spread its delicious perfumes. By virtue of these propitious manifestations, by my confidence in Rama\u2019s prowess and in Sita and the words pronounced by the great sages, felicity filled my soul. Then, re-visiting Vaidehi once again, I took leave of her and, scaling the Mount Arishta, leapt in this direction in order to see you all once more. Following the path of the wind, sun, moon and the Siddhas and Gandharvas, I found you here.", "\u201cBy the grace of Rama and your prowess, I have carried out Sugriva\u2019s charge to the uttermost. I have related all to you in detail and it now remains for you to accomplish what is still to be done.\u201d", "Having completed his narrative, Hanuman, born of Mamta, added these significant words:\u2014\u201cFruitful have been the endeavours of Rama and Sugriva! Having witnessed Sita\u2019s constancy, I am happy at heart! By the power of her penances, the most illustrious Sita is able to uphold the earth or consume it with her ire, 0 Monkeys. The power of Ravana also, created by austerities, is great and it is because of this that he was not destroyed when he laid hands on Sita. Nay, the flame to which one reaches out is not so greatly to be feared as is Sita\u2019s wrath.", "\u201cIt now behoves all the mighty monkeys and others, with Jambavan at their head to take part in this expedition, the purpose of which is now known to you, in order to behold Vaidehi re-united with those two princes.", "\u201cAlone I was able to enter Lanka, inhabited by titans and have afflicted that city by my prowess, as also Ravana and his people. What more could I not do therefore with the courageous and powerful Plavagas, endowed with heroism and martial prowess, strong and eager for victory?", "\u201cI shall destroy Ravana with his entire army, his sons, brothers and followers in combat. I shall destroy all the titans and circumvent those invisible weapons and other missiles, bestowed on Indrajita by Brahma, Rudra, Vayu, Varuna, scattering them and slaying the titans; with your sanction my prowess will bring them under restraint. Hills and mountains torn up by me will I discharge continuously, which even the Gods themselves cannot withstand, how much less those rangers of the night? Were the sea to overflow or Mount Mandara move from its place, Jambavan will never be daunted by an enemy host in conflict. And that heroic monkey, the son of Bali, is alone able to destroy the entire host of Rakshasas. With the movement of his vigorous thighs, the powerful Nila could overthrow Mount Mandara itself, how much more the titans on the field of battle. Amongst the Celestials, the Titans, Yakshas, Gandharvas, serpents or birds, show me any who could withstand Dvivida? Nor do I know any who could resist those two sons of the Ashvins, endowed with supreme energy, the foremost of monkeys, in the arena.", "\u201cSingle-handed I have laid Lanka low and, setting it on fire have reduced it to ashes. On every highway I proclaimed aloud:", "\u2018May Victory crown the invincible Rama and Lakshmana! May the King Sugriva, whose support is Raghava, prosper. I am the servant of the King of Koshala, the offspring of Pavana! I am Hanuman!\u2019 I have announced this everywhere.", "\u201cIn the centre of the Ashoka grove of the vicious-souled Ravana, the virtuous Sita waits forlornly at the foot of the Shimshapa tree surrounded by titan women, emaciated with sorrow and suffering, resembling the orb of the moon bereft of its splendour in the midst of cloud. Spuming Ravana, whose powers have rendered him arrogant, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka of fair limbs, remains undeviatingly faithful to her lord. Wholly devoted to Rama, the lovely Vaidehi, thinks of him alone, as Poulomi, Purandara. Clad in a single garment, soiled with dust, I beheld her in the grove surrounded by titan women who were heaping insults upon her. Her hair, dressed in a single braid that unfortunate being was absorbed in the thought of her lord. Lying on the earth, pale as a lotus at the approach of winter, separated by Ravana from the object of her love, she had resolved to yield up her life.", "\u201cWith difficulty I was able to re-kindle Sita\u2019s hopes by addressing that damsel, whose eyes resemble a doe\u2019s, and relating all to her. And she, hearing of the alliance between Rama and Sugriva became happy and, fixed in her devotion, her conjugal affection reached its zenith. Fortunate is that ten-necked demon that she has not destroyed him, due to the boon he received from Brahma; but it is for Rama that the destruction of that monster is reserved.", "\u201cAlready greatly reduced, Janaki grows frailer every day, in Rama\u2019s absence, as learning wanes that is prosecuted on the first day of the lunar fortnight.", "\u201cThus lives Sita worn out by grief! It is for you to take counsel as to what it is proper to do in the matter.\u201d", "Hearing these words, the son of Bali, Angada, said:\u2014", "\u201cThe sons of the Ashvins are exceedingly powerful and proud of the boon conferred on them by the Grandsire of the World, who in order to honour the Ashvi rendered those two monkeys incapable of being slain by any. This unique privilege inflamed their pride and those two powerful warriors, having overcome the mighty celestial host, drank up the nectar of immortality. These two, inflamed with ire, are able to destroy the entire city of Lanka with its horses, chariots and elephants, what of other monkeys? I myself am capable of destroying the city with its titans and the mighty Ravana! How much more so if I am accompanied by powerful warriors, masters of themselves, well-armed, skilful and desirous of victory?", "\u201cWe have heard that the courageous son of Vayu alone set fire to Lanka. He has seen the divine Sita but has not brought her back. I deem it unfitting that warriors as renowned as you are acquaint Rama of this. There are none in leaping and in prowess, whose skill and bravery equal yours in the worlds of the Immortals or amongst the Daityas, O Foremost of Monkeys. Few have escaped the carnage wrought by Hanuman, therefore it only remains for us to slay Ravana and the rest of the titans and bring back the daughter of Janaka, placing her between Rama and Lakshmana! What need have we to trouble those other residents of Kishkindha? It is for us to proceed to Lanka and, having slain the titans, return to Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva.\u201d", "Such was the project of Angada, whereupon Jambavan, the foremost of monkeys, in his wisdom, cheerfully made answer in words fraught with good sense, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Great Monkey, O You of supreme understanding, we have received a mandate from the King of the Monkeys and the virtuous Rama to explore the southern region to its utmost confines, but we have not been commanded to bring back Sita nor would it find favour with that lion among monarchs, Rama, if we did so, for he, proud of his lineage, has vowed before all the leading monkeys that he will himself deliver her. How should his words be rendered null and void? What is the use of undertaking that which is not conducive to his pleasure? This display of our prowess will prove fruitless, O Foremost of Monkeys 1 Let us therefore return to where Rama, with Lakshmana and the illustrious Sugriva can be found and inform them of the result of our quest.", "What you have proposed finds favour with us, O Prince, yet it is by adhering to Rama\u2019s design that you should look for success.\u201d", "All the heroic monkeys headed by Angada and the great ape Hanuman highly approved Jambavan\u2019s words and, those foremost of monkeys led by the son of Vayu leaping down from the summit of the Mahendra Mountain, bounded forward. Resembling the mountains Meru and Mandara, they appeared like elephants maddened with ichor, covering the whole of space as it were with their shadow, their eyes fixed on the highly powerful Hanuman gifted with velocity, having control of his senses and honoured by the Siddhas. Resolved on bringing about the success of Rama\u2019s design, proud of the results obtained, desirous of communicating their auspicious tidings, all those virtuous inhabitants of the forest, eager to assist Rama and avid for combat, jumping and frisking, reached Madhuvana.", "And they came to that celestial grove protected by Sugriva, planted with countless trees, enchanting to look upon, where none might enter. And Sugriva\u2019s maternal uncle, the mighty monkey Dadhimukha guarded that picturesque and spacious garden belonging to the Lord of Monkeys. Extremely anxious to partake of the fruits of that beautiful orchard, those tawny-coloured monkeys, greatly delighted, craved permission of the prince to taste the honey, yellow as they. Then he graciously allowed those venerable monkeys, headed by Jambavan, to drink of the honey.", "Thereupon, under Angada\u2019s command, authorised by that youthful son of Bali, those monkeys ascended the trees, swarming with bees, feasting on the fruit and roots and, in an access of intoxication, began to frolic here and there.", "Singing, laughing, dancing, bowing, declaiming, running, capering and clapping their hands, some supported others, some quarrelled and some talked at random. Some leapt from tree to tree, springing down from the highest branches, some bounded into the air or chased each other round the trees from rock to rock, responding to each other\u2019s songs and laughter, groans and lamentations, exchanging blow for blow.", "Then a general confusion arose amongst that host of monkeys and there were none who were not inebriated or inflamed with excitement.", "Seeing the wood laid waste, the trees stripped of their leaves and flowers, Dadhimukha was filled with anger and sought to restrain them. But that heroic and elderly monkey, the protector of the wood, was in turn upbraided by those insolent monkeys whereupon he grew even more determined to defend the forest that was entrusted to his care against them. Thereafter he spoke to some in harsh terms without fear or forethought and struck others with the palm of his hands, approaching some threateningly and others with soothing words.", "They, however, excited with liquor, restrained by Dadhimukha, began to ill-treat him brazenly without reflecting that the fault lay with them, scratching him with their nails, biting him with their teeth, assailing him with blows of their hands and feet, and knocking him senseless laid waste to the whole of Madhuvana.", "Then Hanuman said to those monkeys: \u201cO Monkeys, gather honey undisturbed! I will drive away anyone who hinders you!\u201d", "Hearing these words, Angada, that prince of monkeys, gaily echoed his advice, saying: \u201cDo you all drink honey. We should be guided by all that Hanuman does, who has accomplished his purpose; even if it be improper, I am in accord with it!\u201d", "Listening to Angada, those foremost of monkeys all cried out:\u2014\u201cExcellent! Excellent I\u201d, praising the prince again and again. Thereafter they surged into the Malin wood with the violence of a torrent and, having penetrated into those orchards, they drove away the guards by force. Happy in the thought that Hanuman had discovered Maithili and having had tidings of her, with the consent of Angada they drank the honey and feasted on the fruits.", "Hurling themselves on the guardians of that orchard who approached them in hundreds, they overwhelmed them with blows and beat them off. Collecting honeycombs, a drona in size with their hands, those monkeys, yellow as honey themselves, drank the nectar and threw away the combs; some in frolic pelted each other with wax or piling up the branches sat down under the trees; some, heavy with drink, heaped leaves on the earth and lay down exhausted whilst others, stimulated by the intoxicating nectar, reeling, struck out at their companions wildly. Singing at the top of their voices, some imitated the roar of lions and some whistled like birds, others, drunk with honey, slept on the ground; some roared with laughter or burst into tears, some babbled wildly whilst others tried to interpret their utterances.", "Meanwhile the guards of the forest, the servants of Dadhimukha, set upon by those terrible monkeys, crushed between their knees, fled in all directions. Wrought up with fear, they approached Dadhimukha and said:\u2014\u201cEmpowered by Hanuman, those terrible monkeys have, despite us, laid waste to Madhuvana and, crushed between their knees, we all but gave up our lives.\u201d", "Highly incensed, Dadhimukha, beholding the destruction in the Madhu Wood, which had been entrusted to his guards, consoled his subordinates, saying:\u2014\u201cProceed to that place and fall upon those insolent monkeys; I myself shall soon follow and drive away by force those who are drinking the honey.\u201d", "Hearing the words of their master, those valiant monkeys returned to Madhuvana and Dadhimukha, in their midst, accompanied them with great speed, bearing huge trees. Arming themselves with rocks, trees and stones, all those monkeys, highly incensed, proceeded to where the Plavam-gamas were to be found, where, biting their lips in anger, they remonstrated with them again and again, seeking to suppress them by force.", "Then all those monkeys, headed by Hanuman, beholding Dadhimukha greatly enraged, drove him back with violence and, as the mighty Dadhimukha of huge arms advanced bearing a tree in his hands, the powerful Angada incensed, intercepted him with his hands and, beside himself with inebriation, without showing the least mercy, though he merited it being his great-uncle, threw him to the ground with violence. Then that monkey, his arms and thighs broken and his face mutilated, bathed in blood, fell senseless for a space, thereafter, disengaging himself with difficulty, that foremost of monkeys withdrew to a distance and addressed his attendants, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLet us all proceed with haste to where the thick-necked Sugriva, resides with Rama. I shall relate all Prince Angada\u2019s misdeeds to him and filled with ire that Sovereign will punish all the monkeys. The enchanting Madhu Wood, enjoyed by his forefathers, inviolate even to the Gods, is greatly beloved by Sugriva and he will mete out heavy punishment to those perverse wretches avid for honey and will slay those who have disobeyed their sovereign, with their friends and kinsfolk. Then shall my wrath, which I am unable to restrain, be appeased.\u201d", "Speaking thus to the guards of the forest, Dadhimukha, their leader, departed with them with all speed and in the twinkling of an eye, reached the place where that sagacious offspring of the Sun, Sugriva, was.", "Beholding Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva, that great and heroic monkey, Dadhimukha, descending from the sky, alighted on the ground and with a sorrowful mien placing his joined palms to his forehead, touched Sugriva\u2019s feet.", "Seeing that monkey prostrating himself, his forehead touching the earth, Sugriva, his heart moved, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cRise, Rise! Why art you lying prostrate at my feet? Speak without fear! Why hast you come hither? It behoves you to make your purpose plain. Is all well in Madhuvana? I wish to know everything, O Monkey!\u201d", "Thus reassured by the magnanimous Sugriva, the highly sagacious Dadhimukha rose and spoke as follows:\u2014", "\u201cO Lord, that wood which neither you nor Bah suffered to be enjoyed by the monkeys, has been laid waste by them! Seeking to drive them away with my attendants, they, disregarding me, continued to feast there merrily. I resisted their depredations with the assistance of my guards, but without showing any consideration for me, O Prince, those savages continued their orgy. These attendants of mine, assaulted by them, were driven from the wood and those countless powerful monkeys, their eyes inflamed with anger, broke their arms and feet and, crushing them between their thighs, flung them into the air. You are the living lord of these warriors who have been assaulted by those monkeys, who even now are pillaging Madhuvana and quaffing the honey.\u201d", "While Sugriva listened to these tidings, the sagacious Lakshmana, Slayer of his Foes, enquired of him saying:\u2014\u201cO King, who is this monkey, the guard over the forest who has come to you and what distress has led him to speak thus?\u201d", "Being thus addressed by the high-souled Lakshmana, Sugriva, skilled in converse, answered:\u2014", "\u201cO Noble Lakshmana, this is Dadhimukha and this heroic monkey informs me that those war-like forest dwellers led by Angada have drunk the honey and eaten the fruits of the orchard. Such an escapade would not have been indulged in by those who had failed in their mission. Assuredly they have been successfill since they have devastated the wood. It is for this reason that they have beaten with their knees those who have obstructed their revelry and have disregarded the valiant Dadhimukha whom I myself appointed as guardian to my orchard. In sooth, Hanuman and none other must have discovered the divine Sita. Hanuman alone could accomplish such a feat. The success of that enterprise depended on the sagacity of that foremost of monkeys endowed with courage, strength and learning. Where Jambavan and Angada are the leaders and Hanuman the moving spirit, success is assured. Assuredly Madhuvana has been laid waste by those heroic monkeys led by Angada. Having explored the southern region, on their return this orchard excited their cupidity, whereupon they plundered it and drank the honey, assaulting the guards and beating them with their knees. This monkey, the gentle-voiced Dadhimukha, renowned for his prowess has come to communicate these tidings to me. O Mighty Saumitri, undoubtedly Sita must have been found else these monkeys would never have destroyed the wood bestowed on us by the Gods.\u201d", "Hearing these words pleasant to the ear falling from Sugriva\u2019s lips, the virtuous Lakshmana and Raghava were overcome with joy and the illustrious Sugriva, exultant on receiving these tidings from Dadhimukha, answered that guardian of the forest, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHighly gratified am I that those warriors, being successful, have eaten the honey and fruit! One should bear with the arrogance of those who have been victorious. Return to the Madhu Wood immediately and send all those monkeys with Hanuman at their head, here 1 With these two descendants of Raghu, I wish to interrogate those deer of the branches without delay, who, with the boldness of lions have fulfilled their task, in order to learn if they have discovered Sita.\u201d", "Beholding those two princes, their eyes dilated with joy, in the height of felicity, the King of the Monkeys, realising the success of his enterprise was near, experienced extreme satisfaction.", "Thus addressed by Sugriva, the monkey Dadhimukha cheerfully offered obeisance to him and gave salutations to Raghava and Lakshmana. Thereafter, having honoured Sugriva and those powerful sons of the House of Raghu, escorted by his attendants, he sprang into the air. Departing with the same speed by which he had come, he descended from the sky and, alighting on the earth, entered the Madhu wood. There he beheld those foremost of monkeys, now sober, spending the hours happily, having relieved themselves, the outcome of drinking honey, and approaching them, that hero with joined palms addressed Angada in the following words:\u2014", "\u201cO Noble Prince, do not harbour any ill-feeling towards the guards, who, enraged, sought to drive you away by force. May peace attend you! O You of great strength, do you partake of the honey freely which is thine by right, since you are the heir-apparent and owner of the wood. It behoves you to pardon us for our wrath, arising out of ignorance! Like unto your sire formerly and Sugriva, so art you Lord of the monkey host! O Irreproachable Prince, I have related all unto thine uncle, who, hearing of the presence of the monkeys here, of thine arrival and also of the devastation of the forest, was not the least incensed, rather was he gratified. Highly pleased, your paternal uncle, Sugriva, King of the Monkeys, said: \u2018Send them all here without delay!\u2019\u201d", "Hearing those words of Dadhimukha, Angada, Prince of the Monkeys, skilled in speech, addressed all his companions, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO You Leaders of the Monkey Host, undoubtedly all these events have been related to Rama. This may be inferred by Dadhimukha\u2019s tidings. It does not behove us to linger here further, our mission having been accomplished, O Slayers of your Foes! You have all drunk honey in full measure, O Heroic Forest Dwellers, nothing remains for us but to rejoin Sugriva. Whatever all of you counsel me to do, I shall put into effect. I am your servant and, though the heir-apparent, it is not for me to issue orders to you. You have all accomplished your task; it would therefore be unfitting for me to treat you arbitrarily.\u201d", "Hearing these admirable words of Angada, those monkeys, full of delight, spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cWho, of your status, O Foremost of Monkeys, would speak thus? Drunk with power, each says: \u2018I am the leader!\u2019 None but you would utter words of such felicity. Thine humility augurs well for us. We are all ready to return to Sugriva the King of the Monkeys without delay, but without your word of command none among us is able to advance a single step.\u201d", "On this, Angada answered them, saying:\u2014\u201cIt is well, let us go!\u201d, whereupon all those warriors sprang into the air and the space was entirely filled as if by stones shot from a mortar.", "Preceded by Angada, who was followed by Hanuman, those Plavamgamas bounded tempestuously into the air with a great clamour, like clouds driven before the wind.", "Angada having arrived near to Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys addressd the lotus-eyed Rama, who was consumed with grief, and said:\u2014", "\u201cBe of good courage! Rest assured the divine Sita has been found! These monkeys would not have returned otherwise, the time fixed by me being already past; I infer this from Angada\u2019s joy! Had the long-armed Angada, the foremost of monkeys not been successful, he would not have come back to me. If they had not succeeded in their enterprise, after such an escapade, that youthful prince, his mind troubled, would have appeared dejected. Without having seen the daughter of Janaka, they would not have dared to destroy Madhuvana which was obtained from my forbears or attacked that venerable monkey who guards it. O Noble Son of Kaushalya, O You fixed in your vow and faithful to thine obligations, in sooth Hanuman and none else has discovered Sita. No other is qualified to encompass this end. O You, the foremost of the virtuous, the means to success are intelligence, resolution, valour and knowledge and Hanuman is endowed with all these. Where Jambavan with Angada leads and Hanuman directs the work, there can be but one outcome. O You of immeasurable prowess, have no anxiety! Those dwellers of the wood, having reached the height of insolence, would not have entered into an escapade of this kind had they failed in their mission. They have laid waste Madhuvana and taken the honey, I infer therefore that they have been successful.\u201d", "At that instant, cries of \u201cKilakila\u201d resounded in the sky from those inhabitants of the woods, who, proud of Hanuman\u2019s exploit, were proceeding towards Kishkindha, thus proclaiming their trumph.", "Hearing that tremendous clamour, the King of the Monkeys, curling and uncurling his tail, became greatly excited, whilst those monkeys, eager to see Rama, with Angada at their head and Hanuman before them, drunk with joy, alighted from the sky in front of their sovereign and Raghava.", "Thereafter the mighty-armed Hanuman, inclining his head in salutations, informed Rama of Sita\u2019s physical and spiritual well-being. And hearing from Hanuman the auspicious words sweet as Amrita: \u201cI have seen Sita\u201d, the joy of Rama and Lakshmana was extreme and Lakshmana gazed on Sugriva, who had placed the matter in the hands of the son of Pavana, with profound respect, whilst Raghava, the destroyer of his foes, in extreme felicity looked on Hanuman with veneration.", "Having reached the Mount Prasravana with its many woods, Hanuman paid obeisance to the mighty Rama and Lakshmana. Preceded by the heir-apparent, Angada and bowing to Sugriva and the monkeys, he began to recount the story of Sita and her confinement in Ravana\u2019s harem, of the threats of the female titans, of her unflinching devotion to Rama and the time fixed for her execution. All this did the monkey relate in Rama\u2019s presence.", "And hearing of Vaidehi\u2019s well-being, Rama said:\u2014\u201cO Monkeys, where is the illustrious Sita to be found and what are her feelings towards me? Do you relate everything unto me!\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words, the monkeys requested Hanuman, conversant with the matter, to describe all in detail. And he, versed in the art of speech, acquiescing in their desire, inclining his head in salutation to the divine Sita, turning to the south described his meeting with her and bestowed on Rama the heavenly jewel, blazing in its own effulgence; then the son of Maruta offered obeisance to him and said:\u2014", "\u201cAnxious to behold Sita, I crossed the ocean four hundred miles in extent and after a time reached Lanka, that city belonging to the wicked Ravana which is situated on the southern shore of the sea. There I beheld Sita in the inner apartments of Ravana and there she dwells, O Rama, centring all her thoughts on you. I observed her reviled by hideous titan women who are guarding her in the grove and that noble lady, accustomed by you to felicity, is now stricken with grief in thine absence, O Hero. Imprisoned in Ravana\u2019s inner apartments under the strict surveillance of those female demons, wearing a single plait, forlorn, that unfortunate being is absorbed in the thought of you! Lying on the earth, emaciated, resembling a lotus on the approach of winter, spurning Ravana, she is resolved to yield up her life.", "\u201cO Kakutstha, O Guileless Prince, with considerable difficulty I discovered that princess of whom you are in some sort the very soul and, narrating the glories of the Ikshvaku Race, I succeeded in gaining her confidence, whereupon I told her all.", "\u201cHearing of the alliance between you and King Sugriva, she was greatly delighted and she remains constant to you in faith and love. O Foremost of Men, it was in this condition that I discovered her engaged in severe penances with her heart fixed on you.", "Bestowing this jewel upon me, she requested me to relate to you what happened on Cittrakuta concerning the crow, O Sagacious One and, addressing me thus, she said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Son of Vayu, do you describe all that you have seen here to Rama and present him with this jewel, which has been preserved by me with care. Do you remind him of the mark traced with red powder on my countenance! Say:\u2014", "\u2018O Sinless One, seeing this unique pearl formed by the waters that I send to you, meseems I see you before me and I rejoice in the midst of my distress. O Son of Dasaratha, I shall live but for a month, after which, being in the power of the titans, I shall die!\u2019\u201d", "\u201cSuch were the words addressed to me by Sita of emaciated limbs, whose eyes resemble a doe\u2019s, imprisoned in Ravana\u2019s apartments. I have related all faithfully to you, O Raghava, now take counsel in order to bridge the ocean.\u201d", "Seeing those two princes filled with renewed hope, the son of Vayu having presented the jewel as a token of recognition to Raghava, described everything to him from beginning to end.", "At these words of Hanuman, Rama, born of Dasaratha, pressing the jewel to his heart, wept with Lakshmana. And beholding that marvellous gem, Raghava, stricken with grief, his eyes suffused with tears, said to Sugriva:\u2014", "\u201cAs milk flows from the udders of a cow on beholding its calf, so does my heart brim over on beholding this jewel! This pearl was conferred on Sita by my father-in-law on the occasion of our nuptuals and she wore it on her brow, thus enhancing her beauty. Obtained from the waters and reverenced by the Gods, it was conferred on Janaka by the sagacious Shakra, gratified by his adoration at a sacrifice.", "\u201cSeeing this magnificent gem, I recall the presence of my sire and my father-in-law, the King of Videha. This lovely ornament appeared beautiful on the forehead of my beloved and seeing it, it seems as if she herself were present here. As if sprinkling water on one who has lost consciousness, do you relate to me what Vaidehi has said, again and again, O Friend! What could be more poignant, O Saumitri, than seeing this pearl obtained from the waters, without Vaidehi? If she survive one month more, she will live long, but it is hard for me to exist an instant without Sita! Do you lead me to where you have seen my beloved; after hearing these tidings, I cannot brook a moment\u2019s delay. How can that lady of lovely hips, who was ever timorous, endure life amidst those grim and fearful demons? As the autumnal moon, enveloped in cloud is unable to shine forth, so Sita\u2019s countenance is no longer resplendent. O Hanuman, do you relate unto me again and again what Sita said to you. These words will revive me as the sick are cured by medicine. O Hanuman, what did my gentle, sweet-spoken and beautiful lady, who is separated from me, say to you? How is that daughter of Janaka able to survive in her dire misfortune?\u201d", "Being thus addressed by the high-souled Raghava, Hanuman began to relate all that Sita had said to him:\u2014", "\u201cO Lion among Men, in order to give credence to my report, the divine Sita described what took place on Mount Cittrakuta. Sleeping happily at your side, Janaki one day was the first to wake, when suddenly a crow wounded her breast with its beak. O Rama, you were then asleep on Sita\u2019s lap and that crow again attacked her, pecking her cruelly, and, being bathed in blood and suffering, she did arouse you.", "O Slayer of your foes, seeing her breast wounded, you, like an angry serpent didst enquire, saying:\u2014", "\u2018Who, O Timid One, has with his claws wounded you? Who has dared to play with a five-headed snake?\u2019", "Then, looking here and there, you didst perceive the crow with its talons sharp and bloody standing before you. And that foremost of birds was Indra\u2019s son, who with the speed of the wind disappeared into the earth. Then you, O Mighty-armed One, didst roll thine eyes furiously and resolve to destroy that crow.

Thereupon, O Kakutstha, you in your compassion didst pardon it, albeit it merited death. But thinking it improper that the purpose of the weapon should be rendered void, you didst destroy the right eye of that crow, O Raghava. Then paying homage to you and to King Dasaratha, that bird, thus delivered, returned to its abode.", "\u201cSita said:\u2014", "\u2018O Raghava, you are the foremost of those skilled in weapons, mighty and full of integrity, why dost you not discharge your shafts against the titans?

Those two sons of a king, the foremost of men and subduers of their foes, eager to see you once more, will reduce Lanka to ashes.

O Hanuman, in your company I am able to forget my sufferings awhile. 0 You gifted with great prowess, I shall await your return but doubt if I shall be living then. Beholding you no more, I shall be consumed with fear, unfortunate creature that I am, overwhelmed with affliction!

O Irreproachable Warrior, there are only three creatures qualified to traverse the sea\u2014Garuda, Vayu and thyself. In view of this insurmountable obstacle, what possibility of success dost you see, O You foremost of those skilled in the art of converse? True it is, that you are able to accomplish this work single-handed, O Subduer of your foes, but such a manifestation of prowess would benefit you alone. If Rama however, with his forces, slaying Ravana in fight, were to bring me back in triumph to his capital, it would redound to his glory. It would not be worthy of Raghava to capture me by stealth as did Ravana, who under a disguise bore me away from the forest. Truly it would prove a feat of signal excellence, worthy of him, if Kakutstha, the conqueror of his foes, should destroy Lanka and deliver me.

Moreover those great and powerful monkeys, endowed with vigour, have circled the earth again and again, coursing through the air. Sugriva has many monkeys equal to me and greater; none are inferior.

And you shalt soon behold those monkey warriors, endowed with the strength of lions and tigers, whose weapons are their nails and teeth, resembling the lords of the elephants, hastening here without delay. Ere long you shalt hear the roaring of those leaders of monkeys on the summit of the Mount Malaya, resembling the rumbling of clouds. Soon you shalt see Raghava, the Slayer of His foes, returning from his exile in the forest, installed on the throne with you in Ayodhya.\u2019", "\u201cThereafter the daughter of the King of Mithila, though profoundly afflicted by thine absence, was comforted by these auspicious words and experienced great peace.\u201d", "END OF SUNDARA KANDA.", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s faithful narrative, Rama, full of joy, said: \u201cThe mission that Hanuman has carried out is of great significance and the most arduous in the world; none other could have achieved it, even in thought!

Neither Gods, Danavas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Uragas nor Rakshasas could enter Lanka which is protected by Ravana and, did any in his presumption enter it, would he return alive? Who is able to capture that citadel by assault, that has been rendered inaccessible by its rampart of titans, but one whose courage and valour are equal to Hanuman\u2019s? Hanuman has carried out this important service for Sugriva by manifesting a strength equal to his audacity. That servant to whom his master confides a difficult task and who acquits himself with zeal is said to be a superior man. The one who is ready and capable but who yet does no more than his sovereign exacts from him, in order to render himself agreeable, is called an ordinary man, but he who is well and able and yet does not carry out the command of his king, is said to be the least of men. Hanuman has fulfilled the task confided to him unfalteringly, to the satisfaction of Sugriva; in consequence, through the discovery of Vaidehi\u2019s retreat by this faithful messenger, the House of Raghu, the valiant Lakshmana and I have been saved. Yet even so my heart is heavy, since I am not able to requite the bearer of these good tidings in a fitting manner.

Shake off this melancholy as do ungrateful men the recognition of favours accorded to them. After the tidings you have received and now that the haunt of thine enemy is known to you, I see no cause for thine anxiety, O Raghava. Prudent and versed in the scriptures, intelligent and cultured as you are, do you as one master of himself, banish these unworthy fears that are the obstacles to success.

That vast army of monkeys, commanded by Sugriva, ranged in three divisions, were deeply concerned with the accomplishment of Rama\u2019s mission and, from the shore where they were stationed, the monkey host gazed with delight on the vast ocean lashed by the tempest. Then those leaders of monkeys surveyed that abode of Varuna of limitless expanse, whose distant shore was inhabited by titans. Rendered formidable by the ferocity of its sharks and crocodiles, that ocean, with its foaming waves at the close of day and the approach of night, appeared to laugh and dance. When the moon rose, whose image was reflected limitlessly in its bosom, the ocean surged, swarming with gigantic sharks, whales and great fish, strong like the tempest, and it was fathomless, abounding in serpents of flaming coils and many aquatic animals and reefs. In that ocean, difficult to cross, whose ways were impassable, haunted by titans, the waves, in which sharks and sea monsters swarmed, rose and fell joyfully, whipped into motion by the breeze.", "Emitting sparks and turbulent with its gleaming reptiles, the ocean, that dread refuge of the enemies of the Gods, the eternal region of hell, resembled the sky and there seemed no difference between them.

With its murmuring waves, its innumerable pearls and its monsters as it were pursuing it like a pack of hounds, the ocean, in the grip of a hurricane, seemed to leap excitedly.", "And the magnanimous monkeys surveyed that ocean lashed by the winds and the waves which, whipped by its blast, seemed to groan. Struck with astonishment, those monkeys regarded the sea with its dashing waves, rolling on and on.", "On the northern shore, the army under the command of Nila halted and the two generals, Mainda and Dvivida, foremost among the monkeys, patrolled up and down and on all sides in order to protect the monkey host.", "The army being thus encamped on the shores of the Lord of the Waters, Rama, observing Lakshmana standing at his side, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cSorrow invariably decreases with the passing of time but in the absence of my beloved, mine increases daily!

It is as if we sought to cross the sea without a boat 1 In the presence of such a hero, essentially pious, that Prince of the Great Car, the issue of the Ikshvaku Race who is capable of any exploit, even the Gods themselves are confounded! It is because those sharp arrows, irresistible and furnished with heron\u2019s plumes, that are loosed by Raghava, have not as yet pierced your limbs, that you are still able to boast, O Prahasta! It is because those pointed shafts that Rama discharges, which quench the vital breaths and are equal to the lightning in their velocity, have not penetrated your body, that you dost still bluster in this wise! Neither Ravana nor the exceedingly powerful Trishiras nor the son of Kumbhakarna, Nikumbha nor Indrajita, nor even you thyself, are able to overcome the son of Dasaratha in combat, who is equal to Indra himself. Neither Devantaka nor Narantaka, neither Akampana, the magnanimous Atiratha nor Atikaya are capable of resisting Raghava in battle.", "\u201cYou, the friends of this monarch who is dominated by passion, violent by nature and whose acts are thoughtless, flatter him, as though you were his foes, to the destruction of the titans! Rescue and deliver that king who is held fast in the illimitable coils of a serpent possessed of a thousand hoods and who is formidable and of exceeding energy. It is for the sovereign\u2019s friends, whose desires have been gratified by him, to save him, even were it by dragging him by the hair of his head, like one who has fallen a prey to fiends of immeasurable power. It is for you unitedly to rescue that monarch from the surging waters of the ocean Rama, he who is sinking into the mouth of the Kakutstha hell!", "\u201cI will here repeat those words that are to the advantage of the city, the titans, the king and the host of courtiers! I repeat them loyally and candidly \u2018Let Maithili be given back to that Prince!\u2019", "\u201cHe who, having estimated the strength of his foes, his own resources, the situation and the loss and gain of his undertaking and, after mature reflection, expresses himself frankly and judiciously to his master, is a true counsellor.\u201d", "This speech of Bibishana\u2019s, who was equal to Brihaspati in wisdom, displeased the great Indrajita, Leader of the Nairrita Hosts, who replied to him thus:\u2014", "\u201cWhat do these idle words fraught with fear signify, O Youngest of my Uncles? None other, even were he the issue of another race than our own, would speak thus or even conceive such thoughts! Valour, courage, endurance, steadfastness, audacity and strength are lacking in Bibishana alone, the youngest brother of my sire.", "\u201cWho are, in fact, these two sons of a king of men? One of us single-handed, were he the least of the titans, would suffice to exterminate them both! O Coward, from whence springs your fear? Was I not able to cast the Protector of the Three", "Worlds to the ground, the Lord of the Devas himself? Struck with terror, the Hosts of the Gods scattered in all directions and the loudly trumpeting Airavata was brought down by me, whose tusks I rooted out, dispersing the celestial armies by my valour. I who humbled the pride of the Gods themselves and afflicted the Daityas, am I in mine immeasurable energy not able to subdue these two princes, insignificant mortals as they are?\u201d", "At this speech of that invincible and powerful rival of Indra, Bibishana the foremost of warriors answered him in words fraught with good sense, saying:\u2014", "\u201cMy Child, your reflections are worthless! You are young and thine intellect is not yet ripe; further, to our ruin, you are incapable of ascertaining what is expedient and inexpedient.", "\u201cUnder the guise of a son, O Indrajita, you are in truth a hidden foe to Ravana and, hearing him prate of slaying Raghava, you dost support him. You dost merit death, as also he who had the grievous idea of bringing you here this day and introducing a youthful, rash and arrogant warrior into an assembly of counsellors! O Indrajita, you are thoughtless, imprudent, feeble of intellect, your mind ruined by folly and extreme frivolity and you speakest thus from childishness. Who can withstand the shock of those shining arrows which Raghava looses in combat resembling the Rod of Brahma, like unto fate or the Sceptre of Yama? Do you give back Sita to Rama with treasure, pearls, rich ornaments, celestial attire and gems, so that we may dwell here without anxiety, O King.\u201d", "Bibishana, having uttered these words that were reasoned and full of good sense, Ravana replied in harsh accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt were better to live as a declared enemy or with a venomous serpent than to dwell with one who, under the guise of a friend, is in league with the foe. The disposition of relatives who ever rejoice in others\u2019 misfortunes is well known, O Titan. Kinsfolk ever seek to bring down the one who is endowed with authority, energy, learning and loyalty and, should he be a hero, he is the more condemned by them. Constantly finding delight in the discomfiture of one another, their bows ready to strike each other down, their hearts full of deceit, they are both formidable and dangerous.", "\u201cThose verses formerly recited by the elephants in the Padma Forest, on seeing men with snares in their hands, are well known; I will repeat them to you:\u2014\u2018Neither fire nor weapons nor traps strike terror into us but those of our own kind who are cruel and self-interested, it is they whom we fear! They alone, undoubtedly divulge the means of making us captive!\u2019", "\u201cOf all perils, those that spring from relatives are the worst, this is known to us. From cows we have milk, from relatives malice, from women capriciousness, from brahmins asceticism. That I am held in honour by my subjects and have been called to rule over an empire by descent and have set my foot on the heads of mine enemies, will certainly not have found favour with you! As drops of water are unable to remain on the lotus leaves, so does friendship slip from the hold of worthless persons. As in autumn the thunderclouds, which empty themselves, fail to saturate the earth, so does friendship fail with the vicious. As bees fly away after they have sucked out the honey they have found, so do the unworthy relinquish a friendship after it has served their purpose. As the honey stealer in its greed, feeding on the Kusha Flowers, does not exhaust their nectar neither do the wicked savour friendship to the full.", "\u201cIf any other had addressed such a speech to me, O Ranger of the Night, he would have ceased to breathe at that very instant! As for you, a curse upon you, O Obloquy of your Race!\u201d", "At this affront, Bibishana, who ever spoke what was true, rose up mace in hand with four other titans and, filled with indignation, that fortunate one, standing in space, said to his brother, the King of the Titans:\u2014", "\u201cYou have lost your reason, O King, but say what you will, an elder brother is the equal of a father and must be reverenced even if he leave the path of equity; nevertheless I am unable to tolerate these outrageous utterances of thine! Words of wisdom that are dictated by a desire for the welfare of others, O Tennecked One, are not acceptable to those who are not masters of themselves and have fallen under the sway of death 1 Those who make flattering speeches are easy to find but rare are they who utter salutory though unpleasing words or those who will listen to them 1 I could not brook seeing you caught in the noose of death, who bears away all beings, neither did I desire to see you pierced by the sharp and golden arrows of Rama resembling flaming torches. Even stout-hearted persons full of skill and courage fall in combat and are carried away like walls of sand if death overcomes them. You should accept this counsel on account of its import for thine own good 1 By every means defend thyself as well as this city and the titans! In thine own interest I sought to restrain you but my words have not found favour with you, O Ranger of the Night. Fare-you-well, I go; you will be happier without me! At the point of death, those whose life has run its course do not listen to the advice of their friends!\u201d", "Having spoken thus severely to Ravana, Bibishana went away and almost immediately reached the place where Rama and Lakshmana were.", "Resembling the peak of Mount Meru, like a flash of lightning in the sky, he was seen by the leaders of the monkeys who were stationed on the ground.", "Accompanied by four titans of renowned courage, furnished with armour and arrows, adorned with marvellous jewels, he resembled a mass of cloud, the equal of the God who wields the Thunderbolt and that hero was bearing excellent weapons and was covered with celestial gems.", "Beholding him with his four companions, Sugriva, the sagacious King of the Monkeys, who was invincible, standing amidst his forces became thoughtful and, after reflecting a moment, addressed the monkeys with Hanuman and others anxiously, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWithout doubt, this titan, armed with weapons and accompanied by four of his kind, is coming to slay us!\u201d", "Hearing these words of Sugriva, all the leading monkeys brandishing great trees and rocks, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cDo you speedily order us to slay these evil doers, O King 1 Let us strike these weaklings down so that they fall on the earth!\u201d", "As they were speaking thus, Bibishana, who was master of himself, had reached the northern shore and halting there, that highly intelligent and powerful titan, who was fully selfsubdued, on perceiving Sugriva and the monkeys, said aloud to them:\u2014", "\u201cRavana is the name of a wicked titan and their lord, and I am his younger brother, my name is Bibishana. It is Ravana who, having killed Jatayu, carried off Sita from Janasthana. That unfortunate one is held captive against her will amidst the female titans who guard her jealously. I have tried to persuade them by diverse arguments, continually repeated, to return Sita to Rama but Ravana impelled by fate will not listen to my sage advice. Reviled by him and treated like a slave, I, abandoning my consort and my son, have come to take refuge with Rama. Do you inform the high-souled Raghava, that magnanimous protector of the worlds, that I, Bibishana, have come hither.\u201d", "At these words, the swift-footed Sugriva, full of indignation, ran to find Rama and, in the presence of Lakshmana, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cHaving belonged to Ravana\u2019s forces, here is an adversary taking us unawares, who without warning has come hither to shy us at the first opportunity, like an owl destroying crows! You knowest all concerning the plans, organization, distribution of troops and the secret service of the monkeys, as also of your foes, O You who art their scourge! May good betide You! These titans, who are able to change their forms at will, conceal their designs; they are bold and inventive in strategy, assuredly one may not trust them!", "\u201cThis must be an emissary of the Lord of the Titans who, undoubtedly has come to sow dissension amongst us or to discover our weak points; having first gained our confidence by craft, he himself intends to attack us one day. Assistance that is provided by a friend or an inhabitant of the woods like ourselves or by a compatriot or a servant, may be accepted but one should eschew that offered by a foe, O Lord! This deserter who has come to us is a titan by nature and the brother of thine adversary, how can we trust him on first sight? He is Bibishana, the younger brother of Ravana and he has come with four titans to ask for your protection. Nay, it is Ravana who has sent this Bibishana; it is essential that you satisfy thyself regarding him, O You, the most circumspect of persons! This titan of deceitful soul has come hither for the purpose of treacherously striking you down when you dost least expect it, O Irreproachable Hero! Let him and his confederates die in extreme torture, this brother of the wicked Ravana!\u201d", "Having given vent to his fury in the presence of the eloquent Rama, the King of the Monkeys, a skilled orator, became silent!", "Hearing Sugriva\u2019s words, the mighty Rama said to the monkeys headed by Hanuman who stood near:\u2014", "\u201cYou have heard for yourselves what your Sovereign has expressed in judicious words of deep significance regarding the younger brother of Ravana; in times of crisis one should always receive the counsel of one who desires the welfare of his friends, and who is intelligent and prudent.\u201d", "Thus addressed by Rama, all those monkeys, ardently desiring his success, hastened to express their opinion, saying:\u2014", "\u201cNothing is unknown to you in the Three Worlds, O Raghava; it is in deference to us that you dost consult us as friends! You are loyal, brave, pious, established in heroism and dost act only after you have considered the matter in accord with tradition with full confidence in your friends. Let all the intelligent and experienced ministers debate this matter thoroughly, each in his turn.\u201d", "Thus spoke those monkeys and first the sagacious Angada suggested to Raghava that he should enquire into Bibishana\u2019s intentions, saying:\u2014", "\u201cOne should sound a deserter who presents himself in every way. It would not befit us to put full trust in Bibishana at once. It is in concealing their real nature that these perfidious beings act, and further they attack unexpectedly, which would prove fatal to us. Examine him to discover what is right or wrong before taking any decision and, if it prove to our advantage, form an alliance with him; if to our disadvantage, reject it. If it be fraught with danger, then renounce it, but if it should bring us real benefit, let us give him a fitting welcome!\u201d", "Thereafter Sharabha, having reflected awhile, gave his opinion, revealing his motives, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWithout delay, O Lion among Men, send out a spy and, having by means of a wary agent, undertaken a thorough investigation, deal with him in a suitable manner.\u201d", "Then Jambavan, inspired by his knowledge of the scriptures and his own experience, expressed himself in irreproachable and lucid terms saying:\u2014", "\u201cBibishana has come to us from a declared enemy, the wicked Lord of the Titans, and he has arrived here without any regard for time and place; let us be on our guard against him!\u201d", "In bis turn, Mainda, skilled in the matter of truth and error, a fluent speaker, uttered these prudent words:\u2014", "\u201cBibishana is the younger brother of Ravana, let us interrogate him gently and progressively, O King of Kings! When you have informed thyself of his feelings, then act according to whether his intentions are honest or no, O Prince of Men!\u201d", "Thereafter, Hanuman, the foremost of beings versed in the scriptures, spoke in sweet accents in words fraught with integrity, saying:\u2014", "\u201cEven Bibishana himself cannot excel you who art of an exalted intellect and the foremost of those skilled in speech. It is not from a desire to speak nor out of emulation nor a sense of superiority nor from a love of debate that I open my mouth, O my Lord Rama, but on account of the importance of the matter in hand. That which your counsellors have said seems to me erroneous and the real question does not lie there. If one does not interrogate this titan, it is impossible to discover why he has come hither but to make use of him has its disadvantages also. Concerning the sending out of a spy to make investigations as your minister advises, I regard it as unwise nor will it succeed. It has been said that Bibishana had no regard for time and place when he came hither, I reserve my judgment here; it appears to me that the time and place are appropriate, his fault or merit consists in leaving one for another. Knowing the wickedness of Ravana and your true value, Bibishana has, by his arrival, shown his tact and intelligence. Further it was said, O Prince, \u2018Let emissaries in disguise question him\u2019 and this speech suggested several thoughts to me. He who is suddenly interrogated, if he be wise, becomes cautious and refuses to speak; the most amiable of those, who come as friends, will change after such an useless enquiry. It is not possible, O King, to discover the character of a stranger immediately but only after frequent conversations when words may escape him that will betray any perfidy. The speech of this titan does not indicate an evil nature and further he has an open countenance and I have no doubts concerning him. He is in no way embarrassed and is master of himself, he does not appear to be a knave. His language is not that of a perverse being and I do not feel any suspicion regarding him. Inevitably people\u2019s real nature is only gradually revealed. When an undertaking is suited to the time and place, O Most experienced of Men, and it is a practical proposition, it will meet with speedy success. Bibishana is aware of your magnanimity and also of Ravana\u2019s baseness. He has heard of the slaying of Bah and the crowning of Sugriva and what is more he has a desire to rule the kingdom! If this is what has determined him to come hither and these are apparently his motives, then this is what his alliance is worth to us. I have said what I had to say to prove the upright character of this titan; you have listened to me and the rest depends on you, O Prince of the Wise.\u201d", "Hearing the words of the Wind-god\u2019s son, the invincible Rama, versed in the scriptures, answered him and, expressing his own conclusions, said:\u2014", "\u201cI also have reflected on Bibishana and wish to make the result known to you, O You who art established in virtue! I shall never refuse to receive one who presents himself as a friend, even were I mistaken no honest man could reproach me for it.\u201d", "At these words, Sugriva, that lion among monkeys, reflecting carefully, replied in more reasonable words and in eloquent terms addressed Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat matters it if this ranger of the night be well or ill-intentioned, if in time of peril he abandons his brother, whom will he not betray subsequently?\u201d", "At these words of the King of the Monkeys, Kakutstha looked round on that company and, smiling gently, said to Lakshmana, distinguished for his saintly characteristics:\u2014", "\u201cHe who has not studied the scriptures nor possessed reverence for authority could not utter such words as have been expressed by the Lord of Monkeys! There is however something peculiar in these circumstances, it seems to me, which is particularly to be seen in monarchs. Kings have two avowed enemies, their kinsmen and their neighbours, who turn against them in times of adversity; this is what brings this titan here!", "\u201cRelatives who are not of a perverse nature, honour those of their own family who have treated them well but in the case of kings even a virtuous relative is suspect! As to the fault that you point out which consists in accepting the assistance of a foe, I will tell you what the scriptures say on this, hear me!", "\u201cWe are not related to the titans and it is not our kingdom that he covets. It is certain his compatriots are informed about Bibishana\u2019s departure and for this reason we should receive him. They will have assembled with joy and without anxiety and thereafter the cry \u2018This one or that is afraid\u2019, will have created a division amongst them; this is what has brought about Bibishana\u2019s arrival here.", "\u201cAll brothers, O Dear One, do not resemble Bharata nor all sons what I was to my sire nor do all friends resemble each other.\u201d", "Thus spoke Rama, and Sugriva rising, as also Lakshmana, bowed low and thereafter that exceedingly sagacious monkey said:\u2014", "\u201cKnow that it is Ravana who has sent out this ranger of the night 1 I regard it as imperative that we should make an end of him, 0 You, the most circumspect of persons I This demon under the order of a perverse creature has come hither to make an assault on you, myself and Lakshmana, when we are unprepared for it, O Irreproachable Warrior. He merits death, this Bibishana, brother of that inhuman Ravana, as well as his accomplices.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to the eloquent prince of the House of Raghu, Sugriva, the leader of the army, a fluent speaker became silent and Rama, having listened to Sugriva, that lion among monkeys, reflected awhile and then addressed that foremost of monkeys in measured terms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhether this titan be ill-intentioned or no, what does it matter, he cannot do me the least mischief. On earth, Pisacas, Danavas and Yakshas, as also the titans can be slain by me with the tip of my finger, if I so desire it, O King of the Monkeys.", "\u201cIt is related how a pigeon with whom his adversary had taken refuge entertained him and invited him to partake of his own flesh, even though he was the ravisher of his mate. Such was the hospitality offered by a pigeon; what should therefore a man like myself not do?", "Hearken to these verses, pre-eminently sacred, sung aforetimes by the son of Kanva, that great ascetic of truthful speech, Kandu:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018A miscreant who approaches with joined palms, seeking refuge, should not in the name of humanity be slain even if he be a foe, O Parantapa! The unfortunate or the fearful who plead for shelter or throw themselves on the mercy of their enemy, should be protected by him who is master of himself. If, conforming to the tradition, one does not render assistance according to one\u2019s capacity, either for reasons of fear, delusion or anger, one is reproached by all and the suppliant, who perishes before the eyes of the one of whom he has sought help in vain, carries away all his merit!\u2019", "\u201cTherefore it is a heinous crime not to give shelter to those who petition it on this earth; it is to deprive oneself of heaven and glory and to lose one\u2019s strength and prowess! Consequently I shall follow the excellent counsel of Kandu, which is pious, honourable and leads to heaven as the fruit of merit. Any being who has sought refuge with me, saying\u2014\u2018I am thine\u2019 is assured of my protection, I swear it! Bring this stranger to me, 0 Monkey, I shall offer him security whether he be Bibishana or Ravana himself!\u201d", "Thus did Rama speak and Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, answered that son of Kakutstha, whom he held in deep affection, thus:\u2014", "\u201cWhat wonder is it that you who art loyal, virtuous and established in righteousness, you who shinest like a jewel in the head of kings, should speak thus? I, also, in my heart, am convinced of Bibishana\u2019s integrity. Deduction, feeling, everything has been used to probe this matter thoroughly; let him be admitted immediately amongst us on equal terms, O Raghava! Let Bibishana, who is full of wisdom, join our alliance!\u201d", "At these words of Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, Rama immediately joined Bibishana as Purandara the King of the Birds.", "Raghava having accorded him protection, the younger brother of Ravana, the highly intelligent Bibishana bowed to him, looking down on the earth.", "Thereafter he descended joyously from the sky to the ground with his faithful companions and that virtuous one ran towards Rama and, falling at his feet with the four titans, addressed him in words full of loyalty and discretion, fitting the occasion:\u2014", "\u201cI am Ravana\u2019s younger brother and I have been greatly affronted by him. I have therefore come to seek refuge with you, the protector of all beings! Abandoning Lanka, friends and possessions, I place my kingdom, life and happiness at your disposal!\u201d", "At these words, Rama, in soothing tones, while seeming to consume him with his gaze, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Bibishana, tell me truly what is the strength and weakness of the titans?\u201d", "Thus questioned by Rama of imperishable exploits, that titan described the might and extent of Ravana\u2019s power, saying:\u2014", "\u201cBy virtue of a special boon conferred on him by Svyambhu, Dashagriva is invulnerable to all beings, Gandharvas, Serpents and Birds, O Prince. I have also another brother older than myself, the valiant Kumbhakarna, the illustrious rival of Indra in war.", "\u201cO Rama, Ravana has Prahasta commanding his forces, who is perhaps known to you. It is he who vanquished Manibhadra in combat on Mount Kailasha! When clad in armour that no arrow can pierce, furnished with his archer\u2019s gloves, Indrajita, taking up his bow, makes himself invisible, and on the battlefield, having propitiated the God of Fire, that fortunate one sows carnage amongst the foe, O Raghava. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and the Titan Akampana, who are his lieutenants, resemble the Lokapalas on the field of battle.", "\u201cTen thousand kotis of titans, able to change their form at will, feeding on flesh and blood, inhabit Lanka. At their head, their sovereign the wicked Ravana made war on the supporters of the earth as also the Gods who were all overcome by him.\u201d", "Having listened to Bibishana and weighed his words carefully, Rama expressed himself thus:\u2014", "\u201cThese exploits of Ravana\u2019s that you have faithfully described are well known to me; I shall slay Dashagriva as also Prahasta and his sons; thereafter I shall install you as king; believe me, this is the truth!

Before I have annihilated Ravana with his sons, his kinsfolk and his allies in battle, I shall not return to Ayodhya, I swear it by my three brothers I\u201d", "Thus did Rama of imperishable exploits speak and the venerable Bibishana bowing unto him, said:\u2014", "\u201cIn the slaying of the titans and the capture of Lanka, I will assist you with all my strength; I will break through the enemy\u2019s ranks.\u201d", "As he spoke thus, Rama embraced him and thereafter he commanded Lakshmana saying:\u2014\u201cDo you bring water from the sea and anoint the sagacious Bibishana as King of the Titans under my direction, O Noble Brother 1\u201d", "Thereupon Saumitri, in accord with Rama\u2019s behest, performed the royal anointing in the midst of the leading monkeys and immediately those monkeys, beholding Bibishana raised to that supreme rank, acclaimed that magnanimous titan, crying: \u201cExcellent! Excellent!", "Meanwhile Hanuman and Sugriva enquired of Bibishana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHow shall we, with the mighty army of monkeys who surround us, cross the ocean, that indestructible empire of Varuna? What means should we employ to traverse the refuge of the Lord of Streams and Rivers speedily with our troops?\u201d", "At this question, the virtuous Bibishana answered:\u2014\u201cThat Prince, the offspring of the Race of Raghu, should approach the ocean that was excavated by Sagara and he will assuredly help one of his own race\u201d.", "Thus spoke Bibishana, that sagacious titan, and Sugriva instantly went away with Lakshmana to join Rama.", "Thereafter the thick-necked Sugriva conveyed to him this salutory counsel of Bibishana\u2019s to take refuge with Sagara and it found favour with the virtuously minded Rama. Then that illustrious prince replied to Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, who was accompanied by Lakshmana. Full of respect for that monkey, who sought to gratify him in every way, he smiled upon him as also on his brother Lakshmana and said:\u2014", "\u201cThis plan of Bibishana\u2019s pleases me, O Sugriva and Lakshmana. Sugriva is sagacious and was ever a prudent counsellor: do you both reflect on the matter and say what you consider to be best.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to them, those two warriors Sugriva and Lakshmana answered in respectful tones, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHow should the counsel of Bibishana not find favour with us in these circumstances? He brings us the means to success. Without throwing a bridge over the sea, that redoubtable dominion of Lanka will remain inaccessible even to the Gods and titans with their leaders. Let us carry out the suggestion of the virtuous Bibishana scrupulously; enough time has been lost Let us approach Sagara, so that with our army we may reach Lanka of which Ravana is the support.\u201d", "At these words, Rama proceeded to the shore that was covered with Kusha Grass belonging to the Lord of Streams and Rivers as the God of Fire ascends the altar.", "Now the titan, Shardula by name, who had gone out to reconnoitre, beheld the army encamped under Sugriva\u2019s command, and that spy belonging to the wicked Ravana, King of the Titans, having inspected those troops, returned and, regaining Lanka with all speed, said to his sovereign:\u2014", "\u201cBehold a multitude of monkeys and bears, immeasurable and boundless as the sea, approaching Lanka. The sons of Dasaratha, the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, who are illustrious and endowed with beauty, have come to search for Sita. Having reached the shores of the sea, they have encamped there, O Illustrious Prince. These forces cover ten leagues in extent in every direction! O Great King, it behoves you to inform thyself of the true state of affairs immediately! Let thine emissaries enquire into the matter speedily; restitution, conciliation or sowing dissension are involved here.\u201d", "Hearing Shardula\u2019s words, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans became perturbed and, reflecting on the matter, instantly gave orders to Shuka, the most skilled of negotiators, saying:\u2014", "\u201cGo and seek out Sugriva on my behalf and say to that prince in persuasive and ingratiating tones:\u2014", "\u2018Assuredly you, the offspring of a race of great monarchs, the mighty son of the King of the Bears, art exceedingly powerful!

Do you return to Kishkindha; Lanka cannot be conquered by these monkeys by any means nor by the united efforts of the Gods with the Gandharvas, how much less by men or apes?\u2019\u201d", "At this command of the King of the Titans, that Nightranger Shuka, rising into the air, rapidly passed through space and, having journeyed for some time high over the waters, halted and, standing in the sky, repeated all he had been told by the wicked Ravana to say to Sugriva. As he was still speaking, the monkeys bounded into the air and, smiting him with their fists, prepared to tear him to pieces and fling him to the ground.", "Thus maltreated by the monkeys, Shuka spoke in this wise:\u2014", "\u201cOne does not assault an ambassador, O Kakutstha, therefore send away these monkeys. He who withholds the message of his master and gives voice to that which he has not been authorized to utter, merits death.\u201d", "Hearing Shuka\u2019s complaints, Rama issued a command to those monkeys, who were assaulting that titan, saying:\u2014\u201cDo not slay him!\u201d and Shuka having received immunity from the attacks of the monkeys, steadying himself in the air with his wings, spoke again, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Sugriva, You who art endowed with magnanimity, O Hero, who art full of energy and valour, what shall I say to you on the part of Ravana, the Scourge of the World?\u201d", "Being thus addressed, that mighty King of the Monkeys, the foremost of all the apes, interrupted that Ranger of the Night, Shuka, and made the following proud reply, characteristic of his nature:\u2014", "\u201cYou are not my friend nor art you worthy of my pity, you are neither my benefactor nor dost you find favour with me! You and your kinsfolk are the enemies of Rama, you shalt perish like Bali and you meritest death! I shall annihilate you, your sons, your relatives as also Lanka to which I shall lay siege at the head of my great army and reduce it to ashes!", "\u201cNay, you insensate Ravana, you shalt never escape Raghava even if you were protected by the Gods themselves with their leaders. Were you to make thyself invisible in the sun\u2019s path or enter into hell or take refuge at the lotus feet of the King of the Mountains, you with your followers will succumb to Rama\u2019s blows. In the Three Worlds, I see none whether be it Pisaca, Rakshasa, Gandharva, or Asura, who is able to protect you! You have slain the aged King of the Vultures and carried off the large-eyed Sita in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana and, having made her captive, dost not recognize her for what she is! You are unaware how strong, powerful and irresistible to the Gods themselves is this Prince of the Race of Raghu, who shall deprive you of your life.\u201d", "Thereafter the foremost of monkeys, the son of Bali, Angada, took up the discourse and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Virtuous King, this is no ambassador, he has the appearance of a spy; he is only here to count our forces, let him be arrested, do not allow him to return to Lanka. Such is my opinion.\u201d", "Thereupon at a sign from the king, the monkeys flung themselves on that titan, whom they seized and bound, whilst he, without defence, wailed loudly.", "Ill-treated by those furious monkeys, Shuka began to cry upon the magnanimous Rama, born of Dasaratha, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThey are tearing out my wings ruthlessly and putting out my eyes, may the consequences of all the evil deeds that I have done since the day I was born till the night I die, fall on you if I lose my life!\u201d", "Hearing his cries, Rama would not sanction his death and ordered the monkeys to release him.", "Thereafter, spreading the Darbha Grass on the shore of the sea, Rama with joined palms, his face turned towards the east, made obeisance in honour of the ocean and laid himself down.", "That Scourge of his Foes pillowed his head on his arms that resembled the coils of a serpent and were adorned with ornaments of gold, their habitual decoration; those arms that formerly were perfumed with sandal and aloes, saffron of the hue of the dawn lending them lustre; those arms on which Sita leant on the nuptual couch causing them to shine as do the waters of the Ganges the body of Takshaka; those arms, resembling the shafts of a chariot, that increased the distress of his foes and the delight of his friends, were stretched out on the shore of the sea.", "The tightening of the bow-string had rubbed the skin off the left arm of that skilful archer and the right, that bestower of thousands of kine in charity, resembled a great mace. Leaning on his powerful elbow, the mighty-armed Rama said:\u2014", "\u201cSagara will grant me a passage or he shall be slain by me!\u201d Having thus resolved, he lay down by the ocean, restraining his speech and with a concentrated mind in accord with tradition. There, following the scriptural injunction, Rama lay on the ground spread with Kusha Grass and slept peacefully for three nights. For three nights Rama, endowed with learning and piety, remained beside Sagara, the Lord of the Waters. Nevertheless that indolent one did not appear to that hero, who had yet paid him honour as was his due. Thereupon, his eyes suffused with wrath, Raghava, enraged against him, said to Lakshmana, the bearer of auspicious marks, who stood near:\u2014", "\u201cIt is from contempt that the Ocean does not appear to me in person! Deference and forbearance, integrity and friendly speech, these qualities belonging to virtuous men are not valued by those who are deprived of them, who regard them as weakness, whereas the braggart, the dissolute and the arrogant who boast openly and commit every kind of excess, are overwhelmed with regard! Meekness will never bring victory on this earth, O Lakshmana, any more than in the forefront of battle 1 To-day, pierced by my shafts, you shalt behold aquatic monsters by their leaping churn up the waters where they dwell on every side! See, O Lakshmana, how I shall sever the serpents\u2019 coils and the limbs of the great fish like unto the trunks of elephants. To-day I shall dry up the ocean with its multitudinous waves, shells, pearls, fish and monsters. Because I have manifested patience, the Ocean, the abode of whales, regards me as powerless! Away with forbearance to such persons! It is on account of my mildness that he manifests his true nature 1 Bring me my bow, O Saumitri and mine arrows resembling venomous snakes, I shall dry up the sea and the monkeys may then cross it on foot! To-day, indomitable though he be, I shall yet overthrow Sagara with my shafts; he who is bounded by the shore and who is filled with a myriad waves! I shall wipe out that Ocean, the Abode of Varuna, that is inhabited by great giants.\u201d", "Speaking thus, bow in hand, his eyes dilated with anger, Rama appeared exceedingly terrible, like unto the Fire at the end of the world cycle. Grasping his formidable bow with its barbed and fearful shafts more firmly, he caused the earth to tremble as does Shatakratu with his thunderbolts. His flaming and impetuous arrows, unrivalled in power, penetrated the waters of the sea and struck terror in the serpents. And those waves of the sea with their sharks and monsters, were extremely agitated, so that with the roaring of the wind, a formidable clamour arose. In a trice, the ocean became a mass of clashing waves, throwing up spray, shells and fragments of mother of pearl, and panic spread among the Pannagas of flaming jaws and brassy eyes and amidst the mighty Danavas in their abode, the depths of hell. Waves in their millions as high as the Vindhya and Mandara Mountains rose from that Lord of Waters with his crocodiles and great fish and the Ocean emitted a loud roaring, amidst the breaking billows, with the terrified serpents, demons and great crocodiles in flight.", "Then Saumitri rushed towards Rama, who, in his burning ardour, was stretching his incomparable bow with loud mutterings, crying:\u2014\"Stay! Stay!\u201d and thus speaking, he took hold of that weapon, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou have no need to act in this wise to accomplish thine end and bring Sagara to subjection, O Foremost of Heroes! Your peers do not permit themselves to be overcome by anger! Call to mind the forbearance of virtuous men!\u201d", "At that instant, the Brahmarishis and celestial Rishis, who, invisible, were stationed in the sky, cried out:\u2014\u201cHold! Hold! do not act thus!\u201d", "Thereafter the Prince of the Raghus addressed the Ocean in menacing tones, saying:\u2014", "\u201cTo-day I shall dry up the sea with the nether regions! O Sagara, with your waters consumed by my shafts, your denizens slain by my blows, a great cloud of dust will arise from your drained bed and the monkeys will cross to the other shore on foot!", "\u201cYou have sought to oppose me but art unaware of my valour or my strength! O Abode of the Danavas, being full of pride, you canst not foresee your fate!\u201d", "Thereafter, fixing an arrow resembling the Rod of Brahma and placing it on his excellent bow, Raghava stretched that weapon, and heaven and earth seemed to be riven, as it were, and the mountains trembled, darkness covered the earth and all the regions were obscured. Tremors ran through the lakes and rivers; the sun, moon and stars swerved in their course and though the sky was lit by the sun\u2019s rays, it was enveloped in darkness and blazed with a hundred meteors, whilst thunder reverberated with an unparalleled sound in the firmament. The five celestial Maruts blew and like massed legions tore up the trees, dispersing the clouds in the twinkling of an eye, breaking off the points of the rocks and shattering the mountain peaks. In the sky, loud thunder daps resounded with immense power and tumult. The invisible beings emitted cries of fear and, lying prostrate on the earth in their agony, shook with terror, convulsed and unable to move. Thereafter the Ocean with its mass of water, serpents and demons surged beyond its confines to the extent of a league, though the time of the final deluge was not yet at hand; nevertheless Rama, the descendant of Raghu, scourge of his foes, did not retreat before the disordered heavings of that Lord of Rivers and Streams !", "Sagara himself rose out of the waves, like the day\u2019s orb rising over the eastern mountain, Meru, and that Ocean appeared with the Pannagas of flaming jaws and he was of the hue of emerald, adorned with gold; wreaths of pearls festooned his attire and on his head he bore a diadem of every kind of flower; ornaments of refined gold and pearls from his domain were his decoration. Covered with gems and metals of every kind, resembling the Himavat Mountain, the waters surging round him, he was encircled by the clouds and winds, while the rivers Ganga and Sindhu were his escorts.", "Rising, the noble Sagara, escorted by the rivers with the Ganga and Indus at their head, approached Rama with joined palms, who stood arrows in hand, and, reflecting awhile the Ocean said:\u2014", "\u201cEarth, wind, air, water and fight, O Beloved Raghava, remain fixed in their own nature. Neither from desire nor ambition nor fear, O Prince, nor from affection am I able to solidify my waters inhabited by sharks; nevertheless I will make it possible for you to cross over them! This is my resolve\u2014the sharks will remain inactive while the army makes its way across and, for the monkeys, I shall become like the earth!\u201d", "On this, Rama said to him:\u2014\u201cHear me, O You who art the refuge of Varuna! This arrow of mine must accomplish its intended end! Where shall I let this mighty shaft fall?\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words and seeing that formidable missile, the exceedingly powerful Ocean replied:\u2014", "\u201cTo the north of this place is a sacred region, Drumakulya, a name as renowned in the world as thine own! There innumerable robbers of fearful aspect and deeds, having Abhiras as their chief, drink my waters. The vicinity of those perverse beings is intolerable to me; it is there, O Rama, that you should loose your shaft that never misses its target.\u201d", "Thus spoke the magnanimous Sagara and Rama, in accord with his wish, let fly that marvellous dart in his presence. And the place, where that arrow resembling a flash of lightning fell, is known in the world as the desert of Maru. The earth pierced by that dart emitted a loud cry and from its gaping wound the waters of hell gushed forth. As the arrow fell, it created a thunderous sound and the deep crater which is known as Vrana was filled with the water of the deeper springs; it seemed as if the earth was riven and wells and ponds appeared there. This place became known as Marukantara and is famous in the Three Worlds. Thereafter Rama, the son of Dasaratha, having dried up the waters of the ocean, conferred a boon, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThis place shall be rich in pasturage and free from disease; it will abound in fruit, roots, honey, ghee and milk and be fragrant with aromatic herbs; thus it will remain retaining those excellent qualities!\u201d", "In this way the Desert of Maru came to possess these manifold features and by the grace of Rama\u2019s liberality, assumed a pleasant aspect. When the waters had been dried up, Samudra, the Lord of Streams and Rivers, said to Raghava, who was skilled in the use of weapons:\u2014", "\u201cMy Friend, there stands Nala, the son of Vishvakarma, whose father has overwhelmed him with gifts; he is generous and devoted; great are the powers of that monkey; let him construct a bridge over my waters, I will uphold it; Nala is as skilled as his sire!\u201d", "At these words the Ocean disappeared and Nala, that prince of monkeys spoke to the valiant Rama thus:\u2014", "\u201cResorting to the skill I have inherited from my sire, I shall build a bridge over the spacious and vast domain of aquatic monsters; what the Ocean has said is true!", "\u201cWhen one has to do with the ungrateful, in my opinion the rod is the most salutory method for men I A plague on forbearance as also on generosity and kindness! Assuredly Sagara, that formidable mass of water, in fear of punishment, wished to see a bridge constructed and out of fear was willing to suffer Raghava to pass over it.", "\u201cMy mother received a boon on the Mandara Mountain from Vishvakarma, who said to her:\u2014", "\u2018A son will be born to you who will resemble me, O Goddess!\u2019", "\u201cNo one having questioned me, I have not spoken of my powers but I can assuredly construct a causeway over Varuna\u2019s domain; from to-day let all the leading monkeys set to work 1\u201d", "At Rama\u2019s command, those lions among the monkeys entered the mighty forest with alacrity in hundreds and thousands on every side and those leaders of the simian tribes, tearing up the rocks, which in size they resembled, and the trees also dragged them to the sea and they'covered the ocean with Sala, Ashvakarna, Dhava, Vamsha, Kutaja, Arjuna, Tala, Tilaka, Tinisha, Balalaka, Saptaparna and Karnikama Trees in full flower, as also Cutas and Ashokas. Those foremost of monkeys transported those trees, with or without roots, bearing them like so many standards of Indra and they heaped Talas and piles of Dadina, Narikela, Bibhitaka, Kanya, Bakula and Nimba Trees here and there. With the aid of mechanical devices, those powerful colossi dug up stones as big as elephants and rocks, and the water suddenly spouted into the air only to fall instantly. Thereafter those monkeys churned up the sea by rushing into it on all sides or pulling on the chains.", "That immense causeway constructed by Nala in the bosom of the sea was built by the arms of those monkeys of formidable exploits and it extended over a hundred leagues.", "Some brought trunks of trees and others set them up; it was by hundreds and thousands that those monkeys, like unto giants, made use of reeds, logs and blossoming trees to construct that bridge, rushing hither and thither with blocks of stone resembling mountains or the peaks of crags, which, flung into the sea, fell with a resounding crash.", "The first day those monkeys resembling elephants, of immense energy, full of high spirits and exceedingly merry, erected fourteen leagues of masonry. The second day, those highly active monkeys of formidable stature set up twenty leagues. Bestirring themselves, those giants threw twenty-one leagues of structure over the ocean on the third day and on the fourth, working feverishly, they built up twenty-two leagues in extent. The fifth day, those monkeys, industrious workers, reached to twenty-three leagues distance from the further shore.", "That fortunate and valiant son of Vishvakarma, leader of monkeys, constructed a causeway worthy of his sire over the ocean and that bridge erected by Nala over the sea, the haunt of whales, dazzling in its perfection and splendour, was like the constellation of Svati in space.", "Then the Gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas and supreme Rishis assembling, stood in the sky, eager to see that masterpiece and the Gods and Gandharvas gazed on that causeway, so difficult of construction that was ten leagues in width and a hundred in length built by Nala.", "Those monkeys thereafter dived, swam and shouted at the sight of that unimaginable marvel that was almost inconceivable and caused one to tremble! And all beings beheld that causeway thrown over the ocean and by hundreds and thousands of kotis, those monkeys, full of valour, having built that bridge over the immense repository of waters, reached the opposite shore.", "Vast, well-constructed, magnificent with its wonderful paved floor, solidly cemented, that great causeway like unto a line traced on the waves, resembled the parting of a woman\u2019s hair.", "Meanwhile Bibishana, mace in hand, held himself ready at his post with his companions in case of an enemy attack. Thereafter Sugriva addressed Rama, who was valiant by nature, saying:\u2014", "\u201cMount on the shoulders of Hanuman and Lakshmana on those of Angada. O Hero, vast is this ocean, the abode of whales; those two monkeys who freely range the sky will transport you both!\u201d", "Then the fortunate Rama and Lakshmana advanced thus and that magnanimous archer was accompanied by Sugriva. Some monkeys strode forward in the centre, some threw themselves into the waves, some sprang into the sky, others marched on the bridge, some ranged through space like birds, and the terrific tumult of the tramping of that formidable army of monkeys, drowned the roar of the ocean.", "When those simian troops had passed over the sea by the grace of Nala\u2019s causeway, the king ordered them to camp on the shore which abounded in roots, fruits and water.", "At the sight of that masterpiece that had materialized under the command of Raghava, despite the difficulties, the Gods, who had drawn near with the Siddhas and Caranas as also the great Rishis, anointed Rama in secret there, with water from the sea and said:\u2014", "\u201cMayest you be victorious over your foes, O You, who art a God amongst men! Do you rule over the earth and the sea eternally I\u201d", "Thus in various auspicious words did they acclaim Rama in the midst of the homage offered to him by the brahmins.", "The elder brother of Lakshmana beheld certain portents and as their significance was known to him, he embraced Saumitri and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Lakshmana, occupying this region provided with fresh water, and woods abounding in fruit, let us speedily divide these innumerable forces and form ourselves into battalions 1 Great is the danger I foresee, boding destruction to the world and the slaughter of the valiant bears, monkeys and titans.", "\u201cA dust storm is blowing up, the earth trembles and the peaks of the mountains shake; trees fall, clouds resembling wild beasts emit a terrible roaring and let loose dreadful showers mingled with blood; there is an awe-inspiring twilight, lurid like unto red sandalwood; from the blazing sun, a circle of fire falls; filled with terror, wild beasts and birds with harsh voices are raising mournful cries to the sun on every side. In the night, the moon, bereft of brilliance, burning with a black and red halo as it rises, resembles the destruction threatening the world. A dark stain appears on the solar disc which is diminished, sombre, without radiance and coppery. Behold, O Lakshmana, a thick dust blots out the stars and seems to foreshadow the end of the world! Crows, eagles and vultures fall wheeling, whilst jackals inspiring the greatest terror emit sinister howls. Rocks, maces and spears, hurled by the monkeys and demons, cover the earth which has become a morass of flesh and blood.", "\u201cWithout delay, attended by all the monkeys, let us, this very day, attack this city difficult of access of which Ravana is the support!\u201d", "Thus spoke the Archer Rama, the subduer of the foe in conflict, and, bearing his bow and arrows, he set forth in the direction of Lanka.", "Thereupon all the valiant monkeys with Bibishana and Sugriva at their head rose up crying destruction on their powerful foe and the boisterous demonstration of those heroic monkeys, made with the object of pleasing Rama, filled that son of the House of Raghu with delight.", "That army of warriors in well-ordered, formations looked splendid with the radiance Rama conferred on it which resembled the full moon on a starry night, and the earth, pressed under foot by the energetic tread of that multitude like unto the sea, trembled with fear.", "Meanwhile those inhabitants of the woods heard a great tumult arising in Lanka and the formidable rolling of drums and clashing of gongs caused their hair to stand on end. This clamour filled the leaders of the monkeys with joy and, in their ardour, they emitted shouts that surpassed that uproar, and the cheering of the Plavamgamas, resembling the rumble of thunder in the skies, reached the ears of the titans.", "Seeing Lanka dressed with many coloured banners, the son of Dasaratha bethought himself of Sita and his heart was filled with grief. He reflected\u2014", "\u2018It is there that that youthful woman, whose eyes resemble a gazelle\u2019s, is held captive by Ravana, like Rohini when she is overpowered by the red-bodied planet\u2019.", "Heaving long and burning sighs, that hero looked at Lakshmana and spoke words fitting to the occasion to him:\u2014", "\u201cSee, O Lakshmana, this marvellous city, built by Vishvakarma on the summit of the mountain, set aloft so that it appears to lick the skies, where innumerable palaces duster like unto the aerial abode of Vishnu covered with white douds; Lanka with its blossoming groves looks magnificent like Caitaratha which is filled with the song of birds of every kind and glowing with fruit and flowers! See how a gentle breeze sways the branches from which the birds dart, where bees swarm and where cuckoos abound.\u201d", "Thus did Rama, the son of Dasaratha address Lakshmana and thereafter ranging his forces according to the traditional methods, he issued the following commands to that army of monkeys.", "\u201cLet the valiant and invincible Angada place his troops in the centre with the General Nila. Surrounded by the simian battalions, Rishabha should establish himself on the right wing of the army, and he who resembles an elephant in mustha, the indomitable and courageous Gandhamadana, should place himself at the head of the left flank. I shall go to the forefront of the army with Lakshmana as mine aide-de-camp and Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshin to spy out the land.", "\u201cThose three high-souled ones, the leaders of the bears, should protect the centre of the forces and the rearguard be under the command of the Lord of Monkeys, as the western region is dominated by the sun of brilliant rays.\u201d", "The innumerable divisions being thus skilfully distributed, that army, led by the foremost of monkeys armed with boulders and huge trees, resembled the heavens with its mass of clouds; and those monkeys advanced on Lanka that they were eager to destroy.", "\u201cIt is with the peaks of mountains that we shall demolish Lanka or if need be with our bare fists!\u201d such was the resolve of those powerful monkeys.", "At that instant the exceedingly valiant Rama said to Sugriva:\u2014", "\u201cOur forces are properly marshalled, now let Shuka be released 1\u201d", "Under the order of that Indra of Monkeys, who was full of energy, Ravana\u2019s agent was set at liberty. Released on Rama\u2019s command and harassed by the monkeys, Shuka, in a frenzy of terror went to seek out the King of the Titans, whereupon Ravana with a sneer enquired of him:\u2014", "\u201cWhat is the meaning of your fettered wings? Why are your flanks tom? Hast you fallen into the power of those capricious monkeys?\u201d", "Thereupon Shuka, wrought up with fear, pressed by his exceedingly powerful sovereign, made this reply:\u2014", "\u201cRepairing to the northern shore of the sea in order to deliver your message faithfully by employing gentle and soothing tones, those barbarous Plavamgamas, barely having caught sight of me, hurled themselves upon me and began to beat and pound me with their fists. It was quite impossible to enter into any form of mediation with them or discuss anything; those monkeys are ferocious and violent by nature, O Lord of the Titans! The slayer of Viradha, Kabandha and Khara, Rama, however, who is accompanied by Sugriva, is searching for Sita. Having thrown a bridge over the sea and traversed the salty waves, that archer, Raghava, has come hither and sets the titans at nought.", "\u201cThe bears and monkeys, gathering in thousands of divisions equal to mountains or clouds, cover the earth. There is no more possibility of an alliance between the monkeys and the titans than between a God and a demon! Before they reach the ramparts decide quickly how you will act; either restore Sita to Rama or enter into conflict with him!\u201d", "Thus spoke Shuka and Ravana, his eyes red with anger, looked at him as if he would consume him with his glance and said:\u2014", "\u201cEven had I to enter into conflict with the Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas, I would not restore Sita, were the whole earth to shake! When will my shafts fall on Raghava as the intoxicated bees fall on the blossoming trees in Spring? When, with mine arrows, shall I consume his body flowing with blood as flaming torches destroy an elephant.", "\u201cHis forces will suffer eclipse before my powerful army as the brilliance of the stars at the rising of the sun. That son of Dasaratha is not aware that I possess the strength of Sagara and the swiftness of Maruta, that is why he desires to meet me in combat. Rama has not yet seen the shafts resembling venomous serpents that repose in my quiver; that is why he wishes to enter into combat with me! That Raghava is not yet conversant with my great might nor with the Vina in the form of my bow that I pluck with mine arrows, the bow-string producing a formidable sound, the cries of the wounded its terrible accompaniment, the darts its innumerable notes and which, when I enter the river of the enemy ranks as into a vast arena, I shall cause to resound on the field of battle!", "\u201cNeither the thousand-eyed Vasava in person nor Yama of the fiery missiles nor Vaishravana himself is able to overcome me in battle!\u201d", "Rama, the son of Dasaratha, having traversed the ocean with his army, the boastful Ravana addressed his counsellors Shuka and Sarana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThe entire army of monkeys has crossed the impassable ocean on a bridge constructed by Rama, an unprecedented exploit! I never deemed it possible to throw a causeway over the sea!", "\u201cIntroduce yourselves into their ranks without being discovered and inform me exactly regarding the number and prowess of those monkey leaders, the counsellors who customarily attend on Sugriva and Rama and the scouts and warriors among them; further how the dyke was constructed over the waters of the sea; how the army advances, of their plans and of the strength and weapons used by Rama and the courageous Lakshmana.\u201d", "At this command, the two Titans, Shuka and Sarana, assuming the form of monkeys, boldly entered into the simian ranks but they were unable to count the monkey host which was endowed with unimaginable energy causing the hair to stand on end and which amidst the caves and waterfalls spread over the summits of the mountains. From every side those divisions came, some having crossed, some crossing and some still to cross, and those who were arriving or had still to come, emitted loud roars and, to those rangers of the night, resembled the infinite sea.", "Now the illustrious Bibishana recognized Shuka and Sarana under their disguise and arresting them denounced them to Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHere are two followers of the King of the Titans who have come to spy out conditions, O Conqueror of Hostile Citadels!\u201d", "Terrified at the sight of Rama and despairing of their lives, the two demons, with joined palms, said to him in great fear:\u2014", "\u201cO Most Cherished Issue of the House of Raghu, we have been sent by Ravana to find out about the whole army!\u201d", "Hearing these words, Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who delighted in the welfare of all beings, smiling, answered them, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIf you have inspected the whole army and examined their positions carefully and fulfilled the mission entrusted to you, then return in peace. But if there is anything you have not investigated and you still wish to see, then Bibishana will show it to you fully.

Such is Rama\u2019s capacity and such his weapons that he could overthrow the city single-handed, his three companions standing by! Under Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva\u2019s protection that army is completely invincible even against the Gods and Asuras combined! Now that army of powerful and aggressive monkeys, dwellers in the woods, is breathing war; it is useless to dispute with them. Make peace and restore Maithili to the son of Dasaratha!\u201d", "Hearing the sincere and courageous utterance of Sarana, the King Ravana, answered:\u2014", "\u201cEven did the Gods, Gandharvas and Danavas unitedly seek to attack me and were all beings to tremble, I would not restore Sita; O Friend, having been roughly handled by the monkeys you dost fear them and for this deemest it opportune for me to give up Sita! What adversary is able to ovetcome me in war?\u201d", "Having uttered this arrogant speech, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, in order to survey the horizon, proudly went up to his palace that was as white as snow and as high as innumerable palm trees. Accompanied by his ministers, Ravana, who was transported with anger, swept the mountains, forests and ocean with his glance and he beheld the entire region covered with Plavamgamas.", "Seeing that illimitable and invincible army of monkeys, Ravana enquired of Sarana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWho are the leaders of these monkeys?

Wild beasts are tearing that beautiful body, now a corpse, which was formerly perfumed by my hands with divine essences.

Miserable creature that I am, it is on my account that the irreproachable Rama who is full of valour, having crossed the ocean has perished in the footprint of a cow. It was in an ill-judged moment that the son of Dasaratha wedded me, I, the obloquy of my race, for thus did the illustrious Rama wed death. Without doubt in a previous existence I refused a rare gift,11 who to-day weep for my lord, who here was dear to all.", "\u201cO Ravana, unite the wife with the husband and, without delay, let me die near Rama.

Intoxicated elephants are saddled and steeds harnessed to chariots; hosts of combatants are to be seen with darts in their hands mounted on their horses, fully equipped, rushing hither and thither in their thousands. The royal highways are choked with soldiers wonderful to behold, leaping and roaring like the waves of the sea. Glittering armour, breast-plates, shields, chariots, horses and elephants belonging to the titans full of fire and courage, surging forward, follow in the wake of their king.

I shall soon see you in the lap of Rama who has come hither, all your desires fulfilled and the tyrant fallen.

He causes me to tremble with fear in this Ashoka Grove where I am confined. If in the assembly there be any talk of delivering me or keeping me captive, then communicate the decision taken to me and you will render me a great service.\u201d", "Thus spoke Sita and Sarama answered in gentle tones, wiping the tears from her face the while:\u2014", "\u201cIf this be your wish, I will go at once and when I have discovered his design, I will return, O Maithili, O Daughter of Janaka!\u201d", "With these words she returned to where Ravana was to hear what decision he had taken with his ministers.", "Having listened secretly and learnt of the plans that perverse wretch had made, she returned to the enchanting Ashoka Grove.

A monarch should ally himself to one stronger than himself or to an equal; he should never underrate a foe and if he is more powerful, should make war on him. On this account I counsel an alliance with Rama and the return of Sita who is the actual cause of the dispute. Devas, Rishis, Gand-harvas, all desire him to triumph; do not wage war but resolve to make peace with him!", "\u201cThe blessed Grandsire created two paths that rest either on righteousness or unrighteousness, the path of the Gods and the path of the titans. Righteousness is the path of the magnanimous Immortals and unrighteousness that of the demons and titans. When virtue consumed evil, it was the Krita Age and when wrong-doing swallowed up virtue, the Tishya planet was in the ascendant and you, adopting unrighteousness, didst range the worlds destroying virtue; it is on account of this that your foes have waxed powerful! The serpent of evil, nourished by your folly, is now consuming us, while those allied with the Gods are fortified by their practice of virtue. A slave of the senses, all that you undertakes! excites the wrath of the ascetics, those personifications of the Fire-God whose power is as irresistible as the glowing flames. They purify their souls through austerities and find satisfaction in the performance of their duty. In truth, those Twice-born offer innumerable and excellent sacrifices, kindling the sacred fire in accordance with prescribed rituals; they recite the Vedas in a loud voice and utter sacred texts while subduing the titans. Scattered in all directions, like the stormy waves during the hot season, the smoke, arising from the Agnihotra performed by those Rishis, the equals of Agni, spreads over the ten cardinal points and diminishes the titans\u2019 energy. In the various regions sanctified by their religious observances, the burning austerity of those ascetics torments the titans.", "\u201cYou have received the boon of invincibility from Devas, Danavas and Yakshas but these are men, bears and powerful Golangulas who, full of energy and prowess, are coming hither roaring like lions. Beholding these sinister and formidable portents of every kind, I foresee the total extermination of the titans. With a terrifying clamour, monstrous clouds, inspiring horror, rain hot blood on Lanka on every side. Those beasts drawing the chariots are shedding tears. Discoloured with dust, the four quarters no longer shine; serpents, jackals and vultures are invading Lanka, gathering in the public squares with frightful cries; standing before us in dream, coal black women with white teeth resembling Kali burst into loud laughter, pillaging the dwellings and chattering incoherently; in the houses, dogs devour the sacred offerings and donkeys are born of cows, rats of mongoose; cats mate with tigers, pigs with dogs and Kinneras with demons and men. Red-footed and white pigeons, messengers of death, by their flight foretell the extermination of the titans; domesticated parrots, falling under the attack of other birds, call \u2018Chichikuci\u2019! Birds and wild beasts, their eyes fixed on the sun, cry out! Death in the shape of a human monster, deformed, bald and tawny-coloured, visits the dwellings in turn. These and other omens equally sinister appear. Raghava of fixed prowess is, I deem, Vishnu in human form; he is undoubtedly no mere man; he who built a bridge over the deep is an exceedingly wonderful being! Therefore, O Ravana, for thine own good, conclude peace with Rama who is the king of men.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Malyavan, the bravest of warriors, aware of what was passing in Ravana\u2019s mind, eyeing him, became silent.", "Dashanana could not brook Malyavan\u2019s salutory utterances and, scowling, a prey to anger, tolling his eyes in fury, answered him thus:\u2014", "\u201cI have closed mine ears to the speech you have made, albeit with good intentions; how canst you hold a mere man like Rama, who is single-handed, without any support but that of the deer of the trees, cast off by his sire and exiled to the forest, to be of my stature, I, the Lord of the Titans, the terror of the Gods? Dost you then consider me to be destitute of power?", "\u201cI am at a loss to determine if it be envy of my prowess or predeliction for the foe that has brought you to address such hard words to me, unless it be that you desirest to spur me on! In truth, what man learned in the science of the Shastras would speak thus harshly to a seasoned warrior, were it not to incite him?", "\u201cHaving borne Sita away from the forest, she who resembles Shri bereft of her lotus, why, through fear, should I return her to Raghava? You shalt see him fall under my blows in the midst of the innumerable monkeys who surround him. How should Ravana, whom the Deities themselves dare not meet in single combat, experience fear in this encounter? Rather would I be cut in twain than bend before any I Such was I from birth, it is my nature and unalterable! Even if Rama by some happy chance has been able to throw a bridge over the sea, what great marvel is there in that, that you should give way to terror? It is true he has crossed the ocean with an army of monkeys but I swear to you he will not return alive.\u201d", "Beholding Ravana to be highly provoked and speaking with such fury, Malyavan, abashed, did not reply and duly invoking his success as courtesy demanded, he begged permission to retire.", "Meanwhile Ravana, assisted by his ministers, having deliberated on what ought to be done, set about planning the defence of Lanka.", "Thereafter he gave over the eastern gate to the Titan Prahasta and that of the south to the warriors Mahaparshva and Mahodara. At the western gate he placed his son Indrajita, a powerful magician, with a considerable force of titans and he established Shuka and Sarana at the northern gate, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI myself shall take up that position also!\u201d", "Finally he commanded the Titan Virupaksha, who was full of energy and courage, to occupy the centre of the city with a large number of soldiers.", "Taking every precaution for the safety of Lanka, that bull among the titans, under the sway of destiny, deemed his purpose accomplished. Having made provision for the defence of the dty, he dismissed his ministers and received the acclamations of the assembly, after which he entered his sumptuous inner apartments.", "Meanwhile that King of Men, the Sovereign of the Monkeys, the Son of the Wind, Jambavan the King of the Bears, the Titan Bibishana with Bah\u2019s son Angada and Saumitri, the Ape Sharabha, also Sushena and his kinsfolk Mainda and Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Kumuda, Nala and Panasa, all having reached the enemy\u2019s territory, assembled to take counsel together.", "They said:\u2014\u201cYonder under our very eyes is the Qty of Lanka defended by Ravana, impregnable even to the Gods and Asuras together or the Uragas and Gandharvas. Let us take counsel as to what means to adopt that will ensure the success of our expedition in order to penetrate into the eternal retreat of Ravana, the King of the Titans.\u201d", "At this, the younger brother of Ravana, Bibishana, uttered these words that were both just and irreproachable:\u2014", "\u201cAnala, Panasa, Sampati and Pramati have been to Lanka from whence they have returned. Assuming the form of birds, all four entered that hostile citadel and studied the measures taken by Ravana closely.

Ravana\u2019s son has thousands of warriors under his command, holding lances in their hands, furnished with weapons of every kind.", "\u201cApprehensive, a prey to great anxiety, Ravana, versed in the sacred formulas, is himself stationed with the titans at the northern gate. As for Virupaksha, he, with a strong detachment armed with spears, clubs and bows occupies the centre of the dty.", "\u201cHaving seen these hosts thus distributed, my spies have set out in all haste and returned again. The elephants number some ten thousand, the cavalry twenty thousand and there are more than a million foot soldiers. Hardy and vigorous, these intrepid warriors have ever been their sovereign\u2019s favourites; each of the titan generals, when on campaign, commands a million soldiers, O Lord of Men.\u201d", "Having conveyed this information concerning the city, the mighty Bibishana brought his envoys before Rama and those titans confirmed all that was known regarding Lanka. Thereafter the younger brother of Ravana, in his desire to please Raghava, addressed that Lotus-eyed One further, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, when Ravana made war on Kuvera, seven million soldiers accompanied him. For vigour, daring, energy, extreme power of endurance and pride, they equalled their wicked king. There is no question here of my wishing to agitate you by what I have said but a desire to rouse thine indignation, not your fears, for in knightly valour, you are equal to the Gods themselves. Having set out these monkey forces in battle at ray, you shalt destroy Ravana with your great army composed of four angas which surround you.\u201d", "Bibishana having spoken thus, Raghava gave his orders for the attack, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAt the eastern gate, Nila, that lion among monkeys, should oppose Prahasta with his innumerable infantry and let Bali\u2019s son, Angada, at the head of a strong division, drive away Mahaparshva and Mahodara from the southern gate; that son of the Wind, whose valour is immeasurable, will penetrate into the city with his great forces.", "\u201cI reserve the right to slay the wicked King of the Titans, who owing to the boon he has received enjoys oppressing the Daityas and Danavas as also the magnanimous Rishis and who ranges the worlds persecuting all beings. With the aid of Saumitri I shall force an entry through the northern gate and follow in the wake of Ravana and his army. Let the mighty Indra among Monkeys, the valiant King of the Bears and the younger brother of the Lord of the Titans occupy the central position.", "\u201cThe monkeys should not assume human form in the fray for, when we are fighting in the ranks, the monkey shape should serve as a sign of recognition amongst us. Seven will attack the foe in human form, I, my brother Lakshmana, who is full of valour, my friend Bibishana and his four companions.\u201d", "Having said this to Bibishana for the success of the enterprise, Rama, in the role of a wise leader, decided to stay on Mount Suvela whose ravishing slopes he had observed.", "Thereafter at the head of his great army which spread over the earth, the magnanimous Rama set out for Lanka with a joyous and exultant air, resolved to destroy his enemy.", "Having resolved to stay on Mount Suvela, Rama, followed by Lakshmana, addressed Sugriva and also Bibishana the nightranger, who was full of integrity, devotion, sagacity and experience and, in tones of great sweetness and nobility, said:\u2014", "\u201cLet us ascend the Mount Suvela, that king of peaks and plateaus, filled with hundreds of metallic veins, in order to pass the night there. Then we shall be able to survey Lanka, the haunt of that titan, that wretch who has borne away my consort to his own destruction! He has neither regard for justice, virtue nor the honour of his House, he, who, in consequence of his base nature, has committed this heinous deed.\u201d", "Thus reflecting and censuring Ravana, Rama approached Mount Suvela with its ravishing slopes and began the ascent. Behind him came Lakshmana, proud of his great valour, alert, bearing his bow and arrows and Sugriva, who with his ministers and Bibishana scaled the mountain also. Those rangers of the hills bounded with the speed of the wind scrambling from a hundred sides at once in the steps of Raghava and did not take long to reach the summit.", "From there they observed that splendid city with its marvellous gates enclosed in magnificent ramparts, as if suspended in the air; thus did Lanka, filled with warriors, appear to those monkey leaders and, standing on those wonderful ramparts, the dark-hued titans resembled a second wall in the eyes of the foremost monkeys. Beholding them, the monkeys, in Rama\u2019s presence, burning to fight, redoubled their cries.", "Meanwhile the sun, dyed with the fires of dusk, moved towards the west, and the night, illumined by the full moon, drew on. Then Rama, the leader of the monkey army, having exchanged salutations with Bibishana, established himself happily on the breast of Mount Suvela with the leaders of the monkeys.", "Having passed the night on Mount Suvela, the valiant monkey generals surveyed the woods and groves of Lanka and observing them to be so extensive, agreeable, pleasant, vast and wide, marvellous to behold, they were seized with admiration.", "Champakas, Ashokas, Bakulas, Salas and Talas abounded; Tamalas, Hintalas, Arjunas, Nipas, Saptaparnas in full flower, Nagas, Tilakas, Karnikaras and Patalas grew on every side. The trees with their flowering crests, round which magnificent creepers twined, gave Lanka a brilliant appearance which she owed also to the borders planted with diverse flowers and red and tender buds as also innumerable shady avenues. The blossom and fragrant fruit with which the trees were laden caused them to resemble men adorned with jewels or the ravishing Caitaratha, the equal of the Nandana Gardens, a grove resplendently green in all seasons, filled with swarming bees and sparkling with beauty. Then the valiant monkeys able to change their shape at will penetrated into those groves frequented by waterfowl intoxicated with love and with honey bees where the branches of the trees were filled with cuckoos and resounded to the notes of the shrike and the cry of the osprey and, as they entered there, a breeze redolent with the scent of flowers blew like a soft breath.", "Meanwhile some of the leaders broke away from the monkey ranks and, with the permission of their prince, approached that paved city. Terrifying the birds, deer and elephants, they shook Lanka with their roaring, excelling as they did in shouting and, in their immense ardour, they trampled down the earth so that the dust rose in clouds under their feet.", "Bears, lions, buffalo, wild elephants, antelopes and birds, alarmed by the noise, spread over the ten points of the horizon.", "The Trikuta Mountain had an exceedingly lofty summit that appeared to touch the skies; it was covered with blossom, sparkling like gold, a hundred leagues in extent, stainless, graceful to behold, smooth, inaccessible in height even to birds and could not be scaled even in thought, much less in reality; it was on this promontory that Lanka was built of which Ravana was the highway.", "Ten leagues wide, twenty in length, with its tall gates which resembled white clouds and its ramparts of gold and silver, it was a very marvel! Palaces and temples were the splendid decoration of that city, as clouds at the end of summer are to the region of Vishnu that is found between earth and heaven.", "In Lanka, a building of a thousand pillars artistically constructed, resembling the peak of Kailasha which seemed to lick the firmament, was to be seen. This was the retreat of the Indra of the Titans and the ornament of the city, guarded constantly by a hundred titans. Ravishing with its gold, the mountains served as its decoration and it was dazzling with its rich parks and many squares re-echoing to the song of birds of every kind, frequented by deer, covered with various flowers, inhabited by titans of every degree, and that opulent city of immense resources resembled the celestial regions.", "Beholding that auspicious capital, the valiant elder brother of Lakshmana was seized with astonishment and Rama with his vast army contemplated that citadel filled with treasure, abundantly provisioned, garlanded with palaces, exceedingly strong, with its powerful engines of war and solid gates.", "Then Rama, accompanied by Sugriva and his monkey leaders, ascended the summit of Mount Suvela that had a circumference of two leagues; there he halted awhile, surveying the ten cardinal points and his gaze fell on Lanka which was ravishing with its enchanting groves that had been built by Vishvakarma on the summit of the Trikuta Mountain.", "There above a gateway stood the invincible Lord of the Titans, white chanvaras being waved above him and the triumphal parasol indicating his rank. Anointed with red sandal-paste, adorned with scarlet ornaments, he was attired in raiment embroidered with gold and resembled a dark cloud. The scars of the wounds, inflicted on him by Airavata with his tusks, pitted his breast, and he was wrapped in a cloak of the colour of hare\u2019s blood so that he appeared like unto a cloud dyed with the tints of sunset.", "The Indra of the Monkeys beheld him as Raghava also and, on seeing him, Sugriva, gathering up his strength, in an impulse of fury suddenly bounded from the summit of the mountain and descended at the gate. For a moment he paused, then with a fearless soul he eyed that titan whom he regarded as a mere straw and thereafter addressed him harshly, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI am the friend of the Protector of the Worlds, Rama; by the grace of that King of Kings you shalt not escape me to-day.\u201d", "Speaking thus he suddenly leapt upon him and, snatching off his brilliant diadem, threw it on the earth.", "Seeing him about to rush upon him again, that Ranger of the Night said to him:\u2014", "\u201cSugriva you were unknown to me, now you shalt be Hinagriva!\u201d", "Speaking thus, he threw himself upon him and with his two arms flung him to the ground. Bouncing up like a ball, that monkey struck his adversary in his turn and perspiration broke out on the limbs of both and their bodies were red with blood; each clung to the other, paralysing his opponent\u2019s movements and they resembled the Shalmali and Kimshuka Trees.", "Then followed blows and slaps with hands and arms and an indescribable struggle arose between the two powerful kings, the Lords of the Titans and Monkeys. Hard and long was the combat between these two doughty champions in the gateway, each in turn lifting the other up, crouching and changing their positions, tripping each other and throwing each other down, crushing one another, bruising each other\u2019s limbs, and, falling between the Sala Trees and the moat, they would leap up again, pausing an instant to regain their breath. Then, with arms interlaced like ropes, they remained locked together, struggling and furious, full of skill and energy, moving to and fro. Like a lion and a tiger or two young elephants, that have just grown their tusks, scrutinising each other, with arms interlaced and grappling with one another, they fell on the earth together. Thereafter, rising, they hurled themselves on each other afresh, circling round the arena again and again, like skilled and mighty wrestlers nor were they easily fatigued. Like unto great tuskers, with their enormous arms resembling the trunks, they gripped each other tightly. Grcling round and round in that duel which was long and fierce, they trampled down the earth and, approaching each other, like two wild cats fighting over a piece of meat, each tried to kill his adversary. Taking up diverse postures, describing innumerable evolutions, running like an ox\u2019s urine, halting, coming and going, they executed a myriad different movements; stepping sideways, making feints, twisting to avoid a blow, turning about, darting to the attack, each hurling himself on his opponent, standing firm and erect, disengaging themselves, presenting back and flank, preparing to leap, letting go or stealing away, thus Sugriva and Ravana, to their utmost satisfaction, multiplied such feats in which they excelled.", "Meanwhile the titan had recourse to magic and when the King of the Monkeys perceived it, he flew into the sky triumphant, shaking off all fatigue whilst Ravana, overcome with exhaustion, breathing heavily, baffled by the King of the Monkeys, stood confounded.", "Thus the Lord of the Monkeys, acquiring fame as a warrior, having wearied Ravana in combat, ascended into the infinite blue with the swiftness of thought, and that offspring of the Sun, having accomplished this feat, delighted, rejoined the army, honoured by the monkey leaders, thereby increasing the joy of the foremost of the Raghus.", "Seeing him bearing the marks of valour, the elder brother of Lakshmana, Rama, embracing him, said to Sugriva:\u2014", "\u201cWithout consulting me you have acted thus imprudently; such rashness is not seemly in a king. By your recklessness you have caused me great anxiety as also the army and Bibishana! O Warrior, you are enamoured of deeds of daring! Do not act thus in the future, O Vanquisher of your Foes! If you had come by some misfortune, what would Sita or Bharata or my younger brothers, Lakshmana or Shatrughna have availed me?", "\u201cO Valiant Scourge of Your Foes, if you had not returned, though I am conversant with your valour, this was my fixed resolve; having destroyed Ravana in fight with his sons, forces and chariots, I should have installed Bibishana as King of Lanka, suffered Bharata to ascend the throne and renounced my life, O Great Prince.\u201d", "At these words of Rama, Sugriva answered, saying:\u2014", "\u201cSeeing the one who had borne away your consort, O Brave Descendant of Raghu, conscious of mine own strength, how could I have acted otherwise?\u201d", "Thus spoke that warrior, and Raghava, having commended him, addressed Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious marks, saying:\u2014", "\u201cBeside these cool waters and trees laden with fruit, let us divide and marshal our forces, O Lakshmana! I foresee a terrible calamity boding universal destruction and death to the intrepid bears, monkeys and titans. Harsh winds blow, the earth trembles and the mountains quake; trees crash to the earth, sinister clouds resembling birds of prey roar in terrifying wise and let fall rain mixed with blood; the dusk, red as sandal, is full of horror and from the sun, a flaming circle falls. Wild beasts and birds emit frantic cries and are ill at ease; their voices and fierce aspect deprive them of their beauty. In the night, the moon, shorn of its radiance, surrounded by black and fiery rays, burns red, as at the time of the destruction of the world. A thin, dark, sinister rim of coppery hue is seen round the sun and on its surface a black mark appears nor does that orb approach any other planets as is usual, all of which prefigures the final dissolution of the world.", "\u201cBehold, O Lakshmana, how crows, eagles and vultures are flying low, circulating rapidly, emitting piercing and lugubrious cries! The earth changed to mud and gore will be covered with rocks, javelins and darts hurled by the monkeys and titans I This very day, surrounded by the monkeys on all sides, let us make an attack on that citadel defended by Ravana.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Lakshmana, his younger brother, that mighty warrior rapidly descended from the summit of the mountain and coming to the bottom of that hill, the virtuous Raghava inspected his army which was invincible to the foe. Then, the time having come, Rama, who was conversant with the fitting moment to act, gave the signal to advance and, at an auspicious moment, bow in hand, turned towards Lanka.", "Bibishana, Sugriva, Hanuman, Nala, Jambavan the King of the Bears, as also Nila and Lakshmana followed, and behind them the mighty host of bears and monkeys, covering a vast stretch of earth, threw themselves in Raghava\u2019s wake. Hundreds of rocks and enormous trees served as weapons to those monkeys, verily the vanquishers of their foes, who resembled elephants.", "Soon the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, those subduers of the foe, reached the city of Ravana, garlanded with banners, enchanting with the pleasure gardens which adorned it, inaccessible with its many gateways, high walls and arches. Then those denizens of the forests, encouraged by the sound of Rama\u2019s voice and obedient to his commands, halted before Lanka, which was impregnable, even to the Gods.", "Thereafter Rama, accompanied by his younger brother, bow in hand, surveyed the northern gate, which was as high as the peak of a mountain and took up his position there. That valiant son of Dasaratha, followed by Lakshmana, advanced under the walls of Lanka, whose highway was Ravana. None but Rama could have approached and examined the northern gate where Ravana stood, which was formidable and guarded by him as the ocean by Varuna and which was defended on all sides by titans, as the Danavas, who sow terror in the hearts of the weak, guard Patala. And Rama observed innumerable weapons and armour of every kind heaped there for the combatants.", "Meanwhile Nila took up his position with Mainda and Dvivida at the eastern gate at the head of a host of monkeys.", "Angada with his vast forces, assisted by Rishabha, Gavaksha, Gaja and Gavaya, occupied the southern gate. Hanuman, that virtuous monkey, was stationed at the western gate with Prajangha, Tarasa and other warriors grouped round him, whilst Sugriva, personally occupied an observation post in the centre. At the head of all those leading monkeys, the equals of Suparna and Pavana, thirty-six kotis of renowned warriors were grouped round Sugriva.", "Meanwhile, under Rama\u2019s command, Lakshmana, assisted by Bibishana, distributed his innumerable divisions at each gate. Behind Rama, Sushena and Jambavan, those lions among the monkeys, possessing the teeth of tigers, furnished with trees and rocks, waited delightedly for the signal to fight. Lashing their tails feverishly, they used their jaws and nails as weapons; trembling in every limb, their faces were set grimly and they were extremely strong, some having the strength of ten elephants, some ten times more powerful, some equalling a thousand elephants in might and there were some who had the vigour of a million elephants and even more, for the might of those monkey leaders was immeasurable! Marvellous and astonishing was the gathering of those monkey forces resembling a doud of locusts! The earth and the air were filled with monkeys rushing towards Lanka or already stationed beneath its walls. By hundreds and hundreds of thousands, bears and monkeys poured towards the gates of Lanka that others assailed on every side. The hills disappeared completely under that", "host of Plavamgamasj numbering millions, who were ranging round the city and those heroic monkeys, with tree trunks in their hands, surrounded the whole of Lanka that even the winds were unable to penetrate.", "Then the titans, who in their valour rivalled Shakra, seeing themselves besieged by those monkeys like massed clouds, were struck with a sudden terror, and, as they broke rank, a tremendous clamour arose from that host of combatants which resembled the roar of the ocean beating against the shore! At this tumult, the whole of Lanka with its ramparts, arches, hills, woods and forests, began to tremble.", "Under the direction of Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva, that army became even more invincible than the hosts of the Gods and titans. Raghava, however, having ranged his forces in order to wipe out the demons, took counsel with his ministers and pondered deeply again and again. Desiring to act without delay and with circumspection, he, in his consummate experience with Bibishana\u2019s approbation, calling to mind the duty of kings, summoned Bali\u2019s son, Angada and said to him:\u2014", "\u201cGo My Friend on my behalf and, passing through the City of Lanka without fear, say to Dashagriva:\u2014", "\u2018You have sacrificed your renown, destroyed your kingdom and, in thine haste to die, hast lost your wits! Rishis, Devas, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Nagas, Yakshas and kings, O Ranger of the Night, have been oppressed by you in your reckless pride. O Titan, from now on, that arrogance, begot of the boon you didst receive from Svyambhu, shall be subdued! I shall inflict a fitting penalty for your ruthless abduction of my consort; it is with the Rod of Chastisement, that I have stationed myself at Lanka\u2019s gates. Having displayed your martial valour, slain by me you shalt attain the region of the Gods 1 Do you demonstrate the same courage that you didst employ in bearing Sita away from me, having first deceived me by magic arts. O Most Vile of Titans, I shall rid the earth of titans with my pointed shafts, if you dost not make an appeal to my clemency by returning Maithili to me.", "\u201c\u2018That virtuous prince of the titans, the illustrious Bibishana, who is here, will undoubtedly reign in Lanka without opposition. Nay, it is not fitting that, even for an instant, the crown should belong to one as perfidious as you are, a wicked creature who surroundest thyself with fools and who is not conversant with the Self!", "\u201c\u2018Enter into combat with me, O Titan, exert your strength and valour in the fight, mine arrows will chasten you and you will be subdued! Even should you range the Three Worlds in the form of a bird, O Night-ranger, my glance would follow you and you wouldst not return alive. I give you this salutory counsel\u2014prepare for thine obsequies, let Lanka regain her splendour, your life is in my hands!\u2019\u201d", "Furnished with Rama\u2019s instructions, the son of Tara ascended into the air, like unto the God bearing away a sacrificial offering, and in an instant arrived at Ravana\u2019s palace where he beheld him seated at ease amidst his ministers.", "That youthful Prince of the Monkeys, Angada of golden bracelets, like a flaming torch descended close to the king and having made himself known, addressed the whole of Rama\u2019s exceedingly significant speech, without adding or subtracting anything, to him in the presence of his court, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI am the messenger of the King of Koshala, Rama of imperishable exploits. I am the son of Bali, Angada is my name; perchance you have heard of me?", "The descendant of Raghu, Rama, the increaser of Kaushalya\u2019s delight, speaks thus to you:\u2014", "\u201c'Come forth and enter into combat with me! Manifest your valour! I shall destroy you, your counsellors, your sons, relatives and allies. You being dead, the Three Worlds will cease to be troubled, O You whose enemies are the Devas, Danavas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Uragas and Rakshasas; you thorn in the side of the ascetics! Bibishana will become king when you are slain by me, if you dost not return Vaidehi, having paid her every homage, and cast thyself at my feet!\u2019\u201d", "Hearing these harsh words from that lion among the monkeys, the Lord of the Titans, infuriated, issued the following command repeatedly to his attendants, saying:\u2014\u201cSeize him and put him to death!\u201d", "On this order being given by Ravana, Angada, who in his splendour resembled a blazing torch, was seized by four terrible titans and the son of Tara suffered himself to be made captive, without offering any resistance, for that valiant warrior desired to display his prowess to the host of Yatudhanas. Thereafter, seizing three of the titans, like unto serpents in his arms, he leapt on to the palace that resembled a mountain. Shaken by his impetuous bound the three titans fell to the ground under the eyes of their king. Then the powerful son of Bali scaled the palace up to its roof, which equalled the summit of a mountain in height, and the impact of his bounds caused it to crumble before Dashagriva\u2019s gaze as a peak in the Himalayas is shattered by lightning.", "Having destroyed the roof of the palace, Angada proclaimed his name and with a triumphant roar rose into the air. To the exceeding terror of the titans and the great delight of the apes, he alighted in the midst of the monkeys beside Rama.", "Thereupon Ravana, transported with anger, giving himself up for lost began to sigh heavily. Meanwhile Rama, who was surrounded by Plavamgamas emitting joyful cries, eager to destroy his adversary, advanced to meet him in combat.", "Now Sushena was at the head of innumerable monkeys who were able to change their form at will and, under the order of Sugriva, he patrolled the gates and that invincible warrior resembled the moon moving amidst the stars.", "Seeing the hundreds of divisions encamped under the walls of Lanka and marshalled on the shores of the sea, the titans were amazed whilst some were terror-struck and others, overjoyed at the prospect of fighting, leapt in exultation. Beholding those hosts occupying the whole space between the walls and the moat, however, and seeing the monkeys like unto a second rampart, those rangers of the night, cast down, cried out:\u2014\u201cWoe I Alas!\u201d in their terror.", "In the midst of that appalling tumult, the soldiers of Ravana seized hold of their powerful weapons and advanced like the winds that blow at the dissolution of the worlds.", "Then those titans approached the abode of Ravana and informed him that Rama and the monkeys had laid siege to the city.", "This news enraged that Ranger of the Night, who, repeating his former commands went up into the palace. From there he surveyed Lanka with its hills, woods and groves, which was besieged on all sides by countless divisions of monkeys, eager to fight. Beholding the earth all brown with innumerable Plavagas, in great perplexity he reflected: \u201cHow can they be exterminated?\u201d", "Having pondered long, Ravana regained his confidence and, opening his great eyes wide, he gazed on Raghava and the simian battalions.", "Meanwhile Rama, at the head of his army was rapidly advancing on Lanka which was guarded on all sides and thronged with titans. Thereafter the son of Dasaratha, seeing that city furnished with flags and banners, remembered Sita and was filled with anguish. He reflected \u201cThat daughter of Janaka whose eyes resemble a young doe\u2019s, will be a prey to anxiety on my account 1 Consumed with grief and emaciated, she is pining away, the bare ground her bed!\u201d", "Reflecting on the sufferings of Vaidehi, the virtuous Raghava speedily issued a command to the monkeys to prepare for the enemy\u2019s destruction.", "Hearing the order of Raghava of imperishable exploits, the Plavagas, urging each other on, filled the air with their roaring.", "\u201cLet us demolish Lanka with rocks and stones or with our fists alone\u201d was the resolve of the monkey leaders and, under the eyes of the King of the Titans, in order to accomplish Rama\u2019s cherished desire, those troops divided themselves into columns and began to scale the heights of Lanka. Hurling themselves on that city with rocks and trees, those golden-hued Plavamgamas of coppery countenance, willing to lay down their lives in Rama\u2019s service, destroyed innumerable battlements, ramparts and arches with blows from trees, rocks and fists and filled the moats and trenches of clear water with sand, stones, grass and logs.", "The commanders led their divisions by thousands and hundreds of millions of thousands to attack Lanka and the Plavamgamas tore up the golden arches, broke down the gates, that equalled the peak of Kailasha in height and from the sides and the centre, hurled themselves on the city like great elephants with cries of \u201cVictory to the mighty Rama and the valiant Lakshmana!\u201d \u201cVictory to Sugriva protected by Raghava!\u201d Shouting thus, the monkeys, who were able to change their form at will, roaring, rushed to attack the city.", "Virabahu, Subahu, Nala and Panasa, having demolished some of the outposts, reached the foot of the walls and assigned each column to a post of attack. The eastern gate was besieged by the valiant Kumuda surrounded by ten kotis of triumphant monkeys; his lieutenants were Prasabha and the long-armed Panasa, who were at the head of those forces.", "At the southern gate was the warrior Shatabali, a monkey of proved valour, who was stationed with twenty kotis to obstruct the exit. Sushena, the father of Tara, full of courage and strength, with a hundred thousand monkeys surrounded the western gate. The northern gate was blockaded by the mighty Rama assisted by Saumitri and Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys.", "The colossal Golangula, Gavaksha, of grim aspect and immense energy, supported one of Rama\u2019s flanks with a koti of warriors and the valiant Dhumra, scourger of his foes, supported the other flank with a koti of bears of redoubtable fury.", "The intrepid Bibishana, attended by his loyal ministers, followed his ally, the heroic Rama, everywhere, whilst Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha and Gandhamadana patrolled every side in defence of the simian army.", "Meanwhile, his heart filled with rage, the King of the Titans ordered his troops to make a rapid sortie. At this command falling from Ravana\u2019s lips, a tremendous clamour arose among the rangers of the night and the sound of kettledrums, their discs white as the moon, on which the titans beat with sticks of gold, broke out on every side, while hundreds and thousands of trumpets blared forth, blown by the titans with their cheeks extended to the full. With their dark limbs adorned with ornaments and their conches, those rangers of the night resembled clouds bordered with lightning or rows of cranes; and their battalions advanced gaily under Ravana\u2019s imperious commands as, at the time of Pralaya, the tumultuous sea overflows.", "At that moment from every side, a clamour arose from the army of the monkeys which filled Malaya with its plains, valleys and chasms, and the sound of the trumpets and drums and the leonine roars of those warriors re-echoed over the earth, sky and sea, as also the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of horses, the clatter of chariot wheels and the thunder of the titans marching.", "Thereafter a terrible struggle ensued between the monkeys and the titans as, in former times between Gods and Asuras. With their flaming maces, their spears, harpoons and axes, the titans, demonstrating their native prowess, struck the army of the monkeys and from their side, those gigantic apes attacked their adversaries ferociously with blows from trees, rocks, teeth and nails.", "\u201cVictory to King Sugriva!\u201d yelled the monkeys, \u201cMay our Sovereign prevail!\u201d shouted the titans and each proclaimed his name, while other demons, standing on the walls, hacked at the monkeys below with hooks and harpoons and they, infuriated, leapt into the air and dragged down those soldiers stationed on the walls by seizing them with their arms, and that conflict between demons and monkeys was appalling and the earth was covered with mud and flesh in that astonishing fight.", "Those high-souled monkey troops fought with terrible ferocity whilst the titans wakened the ten regions as, mounted on steeds with golden trappings or elephants bright as fire or in cars flashing like the sun, they issued forth clad in marvellous suits of mail, eager to triumph in Ravana\u2019s name.", "On their side, the mighty army of monkeys, burning for victory, hurled themselves on those demons of formidable exploits and extraordinary duels arose between titans and monkeys who rushed upon each other.", "As Tryambaka fought against Andhaka, so did the son of Bali, Angada, fight with Indrajita, who was endowed with immense energy. Prajangha was attacked by the ever indomitable Sampati and the Monkey Hanuman measured his strength with Jambumali. A prey to violent anger, Bibishana, the younger brother of Ravana, entered into a furious combat with the exceedingly impetuous Shatrughna. The valiant Gaja fought with the Titan Tapana and the powerful Nila with Nikumbha. That Indra of Monkeys, Sugriva, attacked Praghasa with violence and the fortunate Lakshmana engaged in combat with Virupaksha. The unapproachable Agniketu with the Titan Rashmiketu, Mitraghna and Yajnakopa unitedly entered into combat with Rama, Vajramushti fought against Mainda and Ashanipratha against Dvivida, those two foremost of monkeys with the greatest of titans. The valiant son of Dharma, Sushena, that great monkey of illustrious name, grappled with Vidyunmalin and, from every side, other monkeys heroically engaged in countless duels with other titans. Then an appalling battle, causing the hair to stand on end, took place between titans and monkeys who were full of prowess and eager to triumph.", "From the bodies of those monkeys and rangers of the night, torrents flowed, their hair being the grass, their blood the water bearing away heaps of corpses.", "As Shatakratu with his thunderbolt, so Indrajita, with his mace, in fury, struck at Angada but that intrepid destroyer of enemy hosts shattered his chariot, the framework of which being encrusted with gold, and slew his horses and driver. Sampati, wounded by Parjangha with three arrows, struck him over the head with an Ashvakama Tree; Jambumali, standing in his chariot, full of strength and fury tore open Hanuman\u2019s breast in the fight with the force of his driving, but he, who was born of the Wind-god, approaching that car, soon overthrew it with the palm of his hand. The redoubtable Pratapana, yelling, rushed on Nala, who with his limbs pierced by the pointed shafts of that skilful titan, suddenly scratched out his eyes.", "As Praghasa appeared to be consuming the hosts of the King of the Monkeys, Sugriva hastily struck him with a Saptapama Tree, while Lakshmana, overwhelmed by a hail of missiles by Virupaksha, that titan of ferocious aspect, struck him down with a single blow. Thereafter the indomitable Agniketu, the Titans Rashmiketu, Mitraghna and Yajnakopa sought to consume Rama with their arrows, whereupon he, in fury, with four formidable shafts, resembling tongues of fire, severed the heads of all four in the struggle. Vajramushti, struck by a blow from Mainda\u2019s fist in the fight, was overthrown with his chariot, driver and horses, which resembled an aerial car belonging to the Gods; Nikumbha battling against Nila, who was like unto a piece of collyrium, pierced him with his whetted shafts as the sun with its rays pierces a cloud; and, again and again that deft-handed ranger of the night Nikumbha, with a hundred arrows wounded Nila in the fray whereupon that monkey began to laugh and seizing the wheel of his adversary\u2019s chariot, he who resembled Vishnu on the battlefield, severed the head of that titan and that of his charioteer.", "Dvivida, whose impact was like unto a flash of lightning, struck Samaprabha with a great rock at which the titans stared in amazement and that foremost of monkeys, Dvivida, who fought with blows of trees, was pierced in his turn with arrows resembling lightning and his limbs being lacerated by those shafts, that monkey grew enraged and with a single blow from a Sala Tree struck down the titan, his chariot and his horses.", "Thereafter Vidyunmalin repeatedly emitting loud cries, standing in his car, wounded Sushena with gold encrusted arrows and seeing him, that foremost of monkeys suddenly overthrew the chariot with a great rock. Vidyunmalin however, that agile night ranger, sprang down from his car and, mace in hand, stood ready on the field whereupon that lion among monkeys, infuriated, seizing a great rock, rushed at the titan but as he precipitated himself upon him, Vidyunmalin with a deft stroke, wounded him in the belly with his mace. Then the excellent Plavaga, receiving that terrible and unexpected blow dealt by his opponent, immediately turned and, in a desperate encounter, hurled a rock upon him. Struck by that missile, Vidyunmalin, that prowler of the night, his chest crushed, fell lifeless on the earth. Thus, under the blows of the simian warriors, the heroic titans perished in a series of hand to hand encounters as the Daityas under the blows of the inhabitants of the Celestial Region. Bhallas and other weapons, maces, lances, darts, shattered chariots, war-horses that had been slain, as also elephants from whose temples ichor exuded and the bodies of monkeys and titans, with wheels, axles, yokes and shafts strewed the earth; the carnage was fearful, a veritable jackal\u2019s feast. The headless trunks of monkeys and titans lay in heaps everywhere in the midst of that appalling conflict which resembled the war between Gods and Asuras.", "In that stubborn engagement, decimated by the foremost of monkeys, the rangers of the night as the day ended, maddened by the smell of blood, in desperation made preparations for the morrow, and those titans, their limbs covered with blood, desired nothing so greatly as that night should fall.", "During the combat between monkeys and titans, the sun sank below the horizon, giving place to a night of carnage. In their mutual hostility, monkeys and titans, burning for victory, continued to fight in the gathering gloom.", "\u201cArt you a titan?\u201d asked the monkeys\u2014\u201cArt you a monkey?\u201d questioned the titans and struck at each other in the darkness. \u201cStrike!\u201d \u201cKill!\u201d \u201cCome hither!\u201d \u201cWhy fleest you?\u201d could be heard in that appalling struggle.", "Clad in mail, the titans, their dark hue intensified by the impenetrable gloom, resembled hills covered with woods abounding in phosphorescent herbs and, transported with anger, they bounded forward in order to fall on the Plavamgamas and devour them, but these hurled themselves on the horses with golden plumes and the banners, like unto tongues of fire, and with indescribable fury tore them down with their sharp daws. Thus did those mighty monkey warriors sow confusion amongst the titans and they clawed the elephants and those mounted upon them and the chariots from which the banners streamed, breaking them to pieces with their teeth.", "Full of fury, Lakshmana and Rama, with their arrows resembling venomous snakes pierced the foremost of the titans, both those who were visible and those who were invisible, and the dust rising from the hooves of the horses and the wheels of the chariots filled the ears and eyes of the combatants, whilst rivers of blood flowed in dreadful torrents in that ghastly tumult which caused the hair to stand on end.", "Meanwhile the sound of gongs and drums, marvellous to hear, joined to the blare of conches and the rattle of wheels, and a terrible clamour arose of horses neighing mingling with the cries of the wounded. The corpses of great monkeys, spears, maces and the bodies of the titans, who were able to change their form at will, lay in heaps as high as a mountain on the battlefield. And those weapons appeared to be offered up as a profusion of flowers by the earth, which was entirely hidden and rendered impassable by rivers of blood. That fatal night was as calamitous to the monkeys and titans as the night of dissolution wherein no being survives.", "Meanwhile the titans, aided by that impenetrable darkness, with great ferocity showered a hail of weapons on Rama and, yelling, advanced upon him in fury like the ocean at the time of the destruction of all creatures. And Rama, in the twinkling of an eye, with six shafts resembling tongues of flame struck down six titans\u2014the indomitable Yajnashatru, Mahaparshva, Mahodara, Vajradamshtra of colossal stature and the two emissaries, Shuka and Sarana. With his innumerable shafts, Rama thereafter pierced them all in their vital parts, so that under that shower of arrows they fled from the field, barely escaping with their lives. In an instant, that warrior of the great car lit up the cardinal points with his formidable missiles resembling tongues of fire so that every quarter became luminous. All those titans, who dared to challenge Rama, perished like moths in a flame, and those arrows, whose points were of fine gold, flying everywhere, illumined the night as do the fireflies in autumn. The cries of the titans and the roll of drums increased the horrors of that night beyond imagining and, in that terrible uproar which re-echoed on every side, it seemed as if the Mount Trikuta was emitting confused murmurs from its innumerable caves.", "The gigantic Golangulas, black as night, crushed the rangers of the night in their arms in order to devour them and Angada destroyed his foes with savagery in the struggle.", "Then Indrajita, after that monkey had slain his steeds and charioteer, overcome with fatigue, made himself invisible and vanished.", "For this feat, Bali\u2019s son, worthy of being honoured, was lauded by the Gods and Rishis as also by the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana. All beings aware of the prowess of the mighty Indrajita in war, witnessing his discomfiture and, beholding that high-souled one, were elated and, in the height of joy, the monkeys with Sugriva and Bibishana, seeing the enemy\u2019s defeat, cried out \u201cExcellent! Excellent!\u201d", "Meanwhile Indrajita, who had been overcome in the duel with Bali\u2019s son of redoubtable deeds, was seized with violent wrath. Rendering himself invisible by virtue of the boon he had received from Brahma, that wicked wretch, who was exhausted by the fight, transported with anger, loosed some sharp arrows bright as lightning on Rama and Lakshmana. On the field of battle, in his rage, he pierced the limbs of those two Raghavas with formidable shafts resembling serpents. Enveloped by illusion, he sought to confuse them in the struggle and, invisible to all beings through his magic arts, that ranger of the night bound those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana with a network of arrows. Then the monkeys beheld the two warriors, those lions among men, enmeshed by the serpentine darts of that furious titan. Not being able to overcome those two princes in his manifest form, the son of the King of the Titans, in his perversity, had recourse to magic in order to make them captive.", "Anxious to ascertain what had become of Indrajita, Rama, that illustrious and mighty prince sent out ten monkey leaders in his pursuit; the two sons of Sushena, the monkey, General Nila, Angada the son of Bali, the valiant Sharabha, Dvivida, Hanuman, the exceedingly courageous Sanuprastha, Rishabha and Rishabaskandha.", "Those monkeys flung themselves joyfully into the air brandishing huge trunks of trees in order to explore the ten regions, but Ravani, by means of his arrows, loosed with force from the most excellent of bows, arrested their impetuous flight and those monkeys of terrific bounds, who were cruelly pierced by those shafts, were unable to discern Indrajita in the darkness, as the sun is obscured when veiled in cloud. With those darts, that lacerated the flesh, the titan transfixed Rama and Lakshmana and remained master of the field and there was no part of Rama or Lakshmana\u2019s body that was not pierced by those serpentine shafts so that streams of blood flowed from their gaping wounds, and they appeared like two Kimshuka Trees in flower.", "At that instant, his eyes inflamed, Ravana\u2019s son, who resembled a mass of collyrium mixed with oil, though still invisible, said to those two brothers:\u2014\u201cWhen I, making myself invisible, enter into combat, even the Chief of the Gods, Shakra himself, is not able to discern or approach me, how much less you two! O Descendants of Raghu, having imprisoned you in this network of plumed darts, I, yielding myself up to the violence of my wrath, am about to dispatch you to the region of Yama!\u201d", "Thus addressing those virtuous brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, he pierced them afresh with his pointed arrows shouting exultantly.", "Resembling a heap of antimony, the swarthy Indrajita, stretching his immense bow, let fly an even thicker shower of formidable arrows in the fight. That warrior, who knew how to make his darts pierce Rama and Lakshmana\u2019s vital parts, set up a continual shouting and the two princes in the forefront of battle, imprisoned in the net of arrows and darts, in the twinkling of an eye, became incapable of distinguishing anything. Paralysed, pierced in their vital parts, exhausted, those two mighty and courageous archers fell to the earth, they who were her lords! Lying on that heroes\u2019 bed, those two warriors, covered with blood, their limbs bristling with arrows, swooned away in their extremity. And there was not a hair\u2019s breadth on their bodies from the tips of their fingers to the end of their feet that was not lacerated, pricked and pierced by those irresistible darts and from both those warriors who had been struck down by that ferocious titan, able to change his shape at will, the hot blood gushed forth as water from a spring. And Rama fell first, his vital parts pierced by the shafts of the wrathful Indrajita, who had formerly vanquished Shakra, and Ravana\u2019s son riddled Raghava\u2019s body with smooth and polished darts as thick as dust clouds. Naracas, Deminaracas, Bhallas, Anjalis, Vatsadantas, Sinhadantas, and those shafts like unto razors fell on that warrior, who lay on the earth like a hero, allowing his golden bow, which was severed, to sink from his grasp.", "Beholding Rama, that lion among men, fall under a hail of arrows, Lakshmana gave up all hope of living and he was overcome by grief on beholding the lotus-eyed Rama, his refuge, who ever delighted in battle, lying on the earth.", "The monkeys too, witnessing this, suffered extreme distress and, their eyes full of tears, overcome with despair, emitted mournful cries; and while those two warriors lay unconscious on that heroes\u2019 bed, the monkeys surrounded them and, assembling there, with the son of the Wind at their head, remained inconsolable and a prey to despair.", "[Full title: The despair of Sugriva and his Army; Bibishana reassures him].", "Meanwhile those inhabitants of the woods, surveying the earth and the sky, beheld the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, covered with arrows and the titan resting, like unto Indra having loosed the rains. Accompanied by Sugriva, Bibishana, lamenting, came to that place in haste, and Nila, Dvivida, Mainda, Sushena, Kumuda, Angada and Hanuman approached, weeping for the sons of Raghu.", "Breathing but faintly, bathed in blood, riddled with innumerable darts, motionless, they lay stretched on a bed of arrows sighing like serpents, washed in blood, resembling two golden standards, and those warriors, lying on a hero\u2019s couch, were surrounded by monkey leaders whose eyes were suffused with tears.", "Beholding the two Raghavas pierced with darts, a profound emotion stirred those monkeys, who were accompanied by Bibishana, and they surveyed the four quarters without being able to discover Ravani, who had veiled himself in his magic during the fight. But while he was hidden by his occult power, Bibishana, also having recourse to magic arts, looking round, beheld his nephew of incomparable exploits, who was invincible in battle, standing nearby. Although that warrior, who had no peer in the field, had made himself invisible by virtue of the boon he had received, he was recognized by Bibishana, who was full of energy, glory and prowess.", "Indrajita, however, contemplating his own feat, gazed on those two warriors stretched on the earth and, in an excess of joy, wishing to share it with all the titans, said:\u2014", "\u201cThose two mighty brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, the shyers of Khara and Dushana, are now struck down by my darts I Even were they aided by the Gods and Asuras with the hosts of Rishis, they would never be able to release themselves from those arrows that paralyse them! I have overcome Rama for the sake of my sire, who is a prey to anxiety and fear, passing the three watches of the night without allowing his limbs to rest on his couch. I have subdued that wretch, who destroys all beings to their very root, on account of whom the whole of Lanka is agitated like a river in the rainy season. As clouds are dispersed in the autumn, so have the exploits of Rama and Lakshmana and all the inhabitants of the woods been rendered void.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to all the titans, who had witnessed the scene, Ravani began to assail all the monkey leaders. First he struck down Nila with nine exceedingly powerful javelins, thereafter he wounded Mainda and Dvivida with three more and that mighty bowman, having pierced Jambavan in the breast with an arrow, loosed ten shafts on the impetuous Hanuman. Then Ravani, in the fight, full of ire, with twin arrows pierced Gavaksha and Sharabha, those two of immeasurable prowess, and the leader of the Golangulas and the son of Bali, Angada, were overcome by innumerable darts by the swift-coursing Ravani. Transfixing the leading monkeys with shafts resembling tongues of fire, that mighty and colossal son of Ravana began to shout in triumph and, having overwhelmed and routed the monkeys with a hail of weapons, that long-armed hero burst into loud laughter, exclaining:\u2014", "\u201cBehold, O Titans, with a formidable net I have bound those two brothers in the presence of their forces!\u201d", "Thus did he speak and all those titans, versed in magic, were exceedingly delighted by his exploit and cheered him unanimously with a roar like unto thunder, crying:\u2014\u201cRama is dead!\u201d and hearing these tidings and beholding the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, lying on the earth without breath or movement, they all paid homage to Ravana\u2019s son, reflecting \u201cThey are slain!\u201d In a transport of joy, Indrajita, victorious in conflict, returned to Lanka spreading happiness among the Nairritas.", "A great fear however had taken possession of Sugriva, who was overcome with terror on beholding Rama and Lakshmana riddled with arrows and pierced in every limb and bone, whereupon Bibishana said to the King of the Monkeys, who was afflicted, his face bathed in tears, his eyes wild with terror:\u2014", "\u201cHave no fear, O Sugriva, stay this rain of tears; these are the fortunes of war; the titan\u2019s victory is not assured; fate may still smile upon us, O Warrior. These two heroes, full of prowess will recover from their swoon. Take courage and inspire me with courage also, who am bereft of a protector, O Monkey! Death cannot strike terror in those who find their felicity in truth and justice.\u201d", "Thus speaking, Bibishana, dipping his hand in water, washed Sugriva\u2019s beautiful eyes and, after taking water and uttering a sacred formula, the virtuous Bibishana then dried the face of that intelligent King of the Monkeys and addressing him in words full of good sense and comfort, said:\u2014", "\u201cThis is not the moment, O Greatest of Monkey Kings, to manifest agitation, excessive emotion in such a situation leads to death, therefore abandon this faint-heartedness that will prove thine undoing and consider how you canst best serve the troops. Keep watch over Rama so long as he has not regained consciousness, for when they come to themselves, the two Kakutsthas will remove all fear from us. This is nothing to Rama nor is he dying, and Lakshmi, who is inaccessible to those who are doomed, has not abandoned him. Therefore pluck up your courage and call on your prowess while I seek to inspire the ranks with renewed confidence. Those monkeys, their eyes dilated, trembling and discouraged by the rumours whispered from ear to ear, on seeing me cheerfully going about amongst the ranks of the army, will abandon their fears like a discarded garland, O King of the Monkeys!\u201d", "Having reassured Sugriva, that Indra among the Titans, Bibishana, passed through the monkey lines reviving their confidence.", "Meanwhile Indrajita, that great magician, surrounded by all his forces re-entered the City of Lanka and sought out his sire. Approaching Ravana. with joined palms, he imparted the pleasant tidings to him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cRama and Lakshmana are slain!\u201d Then Ravana joyfully springing up in the midst of the titans, on hearing that his two enemies had succumbed, smelt the head of his son and in great delight questioned him concerning the matter.", "Being interrogated by his sire regarding what had taken place, Indrajita related how the two brothers, bound by his shafts, were lying without strength or movement. On hearing those tidings from that warrior of the great car, joy flooded Ravana\u2019s inmost being and Dashagriva, banishing his fears regarding the son of Dasaratha, warmly felicitated his offspring who stood beside him.", "The son of Ravana having returned to Lanka, his purpose accomplished, the leading monkeys surrounded Raghava in order to watch over him, and Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Sushena, Kumuda, Nala, Gaja, Gavaksha, Panasa, Sanuprastha and the mighty Jambavan with Sunda, Rambha, Shatabali and Prithu, having re-organized their ranks, alert, armed with trees surveyed the quarters of the sky up and down and on every side and, even if a grass stirred, they exclaimed \u201cIt is a titan!\u201d", "Ravana, meanwhile, full of joy dismissed his son Indrajita and thereafter summoned the female titans who guarded Sita and they with Trijata, having hastened there at his command, were addressed by that monarch in his delight who said to them", "\u201cInform Vaidehi that Indrajita has slain Rama and Lakshmana! Compel her to enter the Pushpaka Plane and show them to her lying on the field of battle 1 Her consort, the One depending on whom rendered her so proud that she refused to be united with me, lies there struck down with his brother in the presence of his army! From now on, free from anxiety, grief and expectation of re-union, Maithili, adorned in all her jewels, will submit herself to me. To-day, beholding Rama with Lakshmana fallen under the sway of death on the battlefield, seeing no other haven and hoping for nought else, the large-eyed Sita will voluntarily seek refuge with me!\u201d", "At these words of that wicked monarch, they all replied\u2014\u201cBe it so!\u201d and went to where the Pushpaka Chariot was, thereafter ascending it. Taking that aerial car, the female titans, in obedience to Ravana\u2019s behests, rejoined Maithili in the Ashoka Grove.", "There they found her overcome with the grief that separation from her lord caused her, nevertheless they placed her in the Chariot Pushpaka and when they were seated therein with Trijata, Ravana took her round the city garlanded with flags and banners and at the same time the delighted Monarch of the Titans caused a proclamation to be made in Lanka announcing that Rama as also Lakshmana had been slain by Indrajita in combat.", "Sita, transported with Trijata in that car, beheld the monkey troops who had been slain and witnessed the joy exhibited by those eaters of flesh and the monkeys afflicted with grief standing round Rama and Lakshmana. And she beheld those two warriors also, lying pierced with arrows, unconscious, riddled with weapons, their armour shattered, their bows broken, transfixed by darts. Those two brothers, who were filled with valour, the foremost of heroes were lying stretched on the earth resembling two youthful sons of Pavaka.", "And when the unfortunate Maithili beheld those two intrepid lions among men, pierced with spears, she broke into piteous lamentations, and the dark-eyed Sita, the daughter of Janaka, of faultless limbs, beholding her lord and Lakshmana lying on the earth, burst into sobs. Exhausted with weeping and grief on seeing those two brothers resembling the offspring of the Gods and, believing them to be dead, overwhelmed with affliction, she spoke thus:\u2014", "Seeing her lord lying on the earth as also the valiant Lakshmana, Sita, in the grief that overwhelmed her, gave voice to her complaint, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThe soothsayers, reading the lineaments of my body, prophesized thus:\u2014", "\u2018You shaft bear sons and never be widowed!\u2019\u2014now that Rama has been slain, their words have proved to be untrue I Since Rama is slain, those who predicted that I should be the companion and consort of the performer of great sacrifices, have uttered a falsehood! Now that Rama has been slain, those soothsayers, who told me I should be highly honoured by the wives of warriors and kings, are proved not to have spoken truly! Now that Rama has been slain, the astrologers among the brahmins, who openly foretold happiness for me, are proved to have spoken falsely!", "\u201cYet I bear the marks of the lotus on my feet by which high-born women receive the supreme consecration with their lords at their coronation nor do I find in myself any marks of ill-fortune which betoken widowhood in those who are ill-starred, yet all the auspicious signs appear to be rendered void for me! These marks of the lotus, said to be of good augury by the Pundits, have no meaning for me, now that Rama is slain!", "\u201cMy locks are fine, of even length and dark, my eyebrows meet, my legs are round and smooth, my teeth evenly separated, the comers of my eyes are shaped like the conch, my breasts, hands, feet and thighs well proportioned, my nails smooth and polished, my fingers well-shaped, my breasts touch each other and have depressed nipples, my navel too is deeply indented, my bosom well-formed, my complexion has the sheen of a pearl, the down on my skin is soft. It is said I possess the twelve auspicious signs: my feet and hands are without hollows and marked with the barley corn and my smile is langorous. Thus did those, who interpret the marks of youthful maidens, speak of me.", "\u201cHaving purified Janasthana, received the tidings of my fate and crossed the impassable ocean, those two brothers have perished in the imprint of a cow\u2019s hoof. Did they not recollect (that they possessed) the arrows of Varuna, Agni, Indra and Vayu, as also the Brahmashira weapon?", "\u201cBy means of magic arts, an invisible foe has slain those two, Rama and Lakshmana, my protectors, who are equal to Vasava in combat and I am now bereft of any support. Nay, if he had come into Rama\u2019s presence, he would not have returned alive even were he possessed of the swiftness of thought but since Rama and his brother are lying struck down on the battlefield, there is no burden too heavy for death to shoulder! Fate is inexorable. I do not weep so much for Rama and Lakshmana or for myself or my mother but for my unfortunate mother-in-law, Kaushalya, who dwells constantly on her son\u2019s return after fulfilling his vows, she who asks herself, \u2018When shall I behold Lakshmana and Sita with Raghava once more?\u2019\u201d", "Thus did Janaki lament and Trijata said to her:\u2014\u201cDo not despair, O Goddess, your lord lives! I will tell you what powerful considerations have convinced me that those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana still live, O Queen. They are, that resolution and martial ardour do not animate the faces of soldiers who have lost their leader, neither would the celestial car, Pushpaka, have brought you hither, O Vaidehi, if those two heroes had succumbed. An army that sees its valiant commander fall is bereft of courage and wanders aimlessly about on the battlefield like a ship which has lost its rudder. Yet there is neither confusion nor disorder among the intrepid forces that mount guard over the two Kakutsthas. I am pointing this out to you on account of mine affection for you. These auspicious omens should re-assure you fully, for know well, the two Kakutsthas are not dead, I hasten to tell you this out of love for you.", "\u201cI have never spoken what is not true to you nor shall I ever do so, O Maithili, for by your conduct and natural gaiety you have found a place in my heart! Nay, those two warriors are not able to be vanquished even by the Gods and Asuras with their leaders. This is what I have observed and communicate to you. Yea, there is a great marvel to be seen, O Maithili; behold how, fallen under those shafts and deprived of their senses, their beauty has not deserted them.", "\u201cIn the natural course, when men have lost their lives, their features exhibit appalling alteration, it is therefore impossible that these two do not still live. Banish your grief on account of Rama and Lakshmana, abandon your sorrow, O Daughter of Janaka!\u201d", "At these words, Sita, who resembled a daughter of the Gods, with joined palms, exclaimed \u201cMay it be so!\u201d", "Meanwhile the Chariot Pushpaka, swift as the wind, had returned and the plaintive Sita re-entered the city with Trijata, whereupon descending from the car, she entered the Ashoka Grove with the female titans.", "Having returned to the royal enclosure planted with innumerable trees, Sita, recalling the two princes whom she had just seen, became a prey to extreme grief.", "Bound by those formidable weapons, the two sons of Dasaratha, breathing like serpents, lay bleeding on the earth.", "Those foremost of monkeys, the valiant companions of Sugriva, plunged in grief, were all standing round the two illustrious warriors.", "Then the mighty Raghava, by virtue of his hardihood and native strength, awoke from his swoon despite the shafts that held him captive. Beholding his brother bleeding, unconscious, tightly bound and his features changed, Rama, full of grief, lamented thus:\u2014\u201cOf what use to me is the recovery of Sita or even life itself, since my brother, now lying before mine eyes, has been struck down in the fight? It were possible for me to find a consort equal to Sita in this world of mortals but not a brother, friend and comrade in arms such as Lakshmana! If he has returned to the five elements, he, the increaser of Sumitra\u2019s joy, I will yield up my life breaths in the presence of the monkeys!", "\u201cWhat shall I say to my mother, Kaushalya, or to Kaikeyi? If I return without Lakshmana, how shall I console Sumitra trembling and crying out like an osprey, who sighs for her son\u2019s return from whom she has been separated so long? What answer shall I give to Shatrughna and the illustrious Bharata when I return without the one who followed me to the forest? Nay, I should not be able to endure Sumitra\u2019s reproaches; I will leave my body here; I am unable to continue living. Woe unto me and to my lack of nobility, since, through my fault, Lakshmana has fallen and lies on a bed of arrows as one who has yielded up his life!", "\u201cO Lakshmana, you didst ever console me in my great misfortune; now that you are slain, you will no longer be able to allay my sufferings by your words. You, who, in this battle, struck down innumerable titans, art fallen, pierced by darts, like a hero on the selfsame field. Lying on a bed of arrows, bathed in blood, you are nought but a heap of weapons! It appears as if the sun has set behind the Astachala Mountains! Pierced with spears, your limbs express thine agony without the aid of words. I shall follow that illustrious warrior to the region of Yama, as he accompanied me when I retired to the forest; he, who ever loved his own and was filled with devotion for me, lies in the state to which my misdeeds have brought him, wretch that I am!", "\u201cEven when deeply provoked, that valiant hero never uttered an unpleasant or harsh word; he who was able to loose five hundred arrows in one shot and who excelled Kartavirya himself in the science of archery; Lakshmana, who was accustomed to a rich couch and who, with his arrows could sever those of the mighty Shakra, is lying slain on the earth.", "\u201cThose vain words, which I uttered, will undoubtedly consume me since I have not enthroned Bibishana as King of the Titans! Return at once, O Sugriva, since bereft of my support you and your leaders will be overcome by Ravana. Recross the sea accompanied by thine army led by Angada with Nila and Nala, O King. I am fully satisfied by the great military exploit of Hanuman, impossible to any other and by that accomplished by the King of the Bears and the General of the Golangulas. That which Angada, Mainda and Dvivida did, the terrible combat that Kesarin and Sampati sustained, the formidable struggle in which Gavaya, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Gaja and other monkeys, who are willing to sacrifice their lives for me, took part, are sufficient for me. Nay, it is not possible for mortals to avoid their destiny. O Sugriva, fearing to fail in your duty, you have done all that a friend and comrade could do; all that is due to friendship, you have accomplished, O Foremost of Monkeys! I take leave of you all; go where it seems best to you!\u201d", "Hearing Rama lament thus, the monkeys allowed tears to fall from their reddened eyes, when, at that moment, Bibishana, having established order in the ranks, mace in hand hurried to rejoin Raghava. Seeing him, who resembled a mass of collyrium, hastening towards them thus, the monkeys thinking him to be Ravani, fled away.", "Meanwhile the illustrious and powerful King of the Monkeys enquired saying:\u2014\u201cWhat does this stampede signify? The army resembles a ship amidst the waves struck by a tempest!\u201d", "Hearing Sugriva\u2019s speech, Angada, the son of Bali, answered: \u201cDost you not see Rama and Lakshmana of the Great Car, those two valiant and illustrious sons of Dasaratha, covered with darts lying all bloody on a bed of arrows?\u201d", "Thereupon that Indra among monkeys, Sugriva, said to his son:\u2014\u201cTo my mind there is some other cause why the monkeys, bewildered, their eyes distended with terror, are throwing down their arms in order to flee in all directions without shame and without looking behind them, jostling each other and leaping over those who have fallen!\u201d", "In the midst of this turmoil, the warrior Bibishana came there, a great mace in his hand and said \u201cVictory to Rama! Victory to Rama!\u201d and Sugriva observed that it was this titan who had caused the panic among the monkeys whereat he addressed the illustrious King of the Bears, who stood near, and said:\u2014", "\u201cIt is Bibishana who has come hither! On seeing him the monkeys, seized with terror, have fled, deeming him to be Ravana\u2019s son; do you rally those fugitives immediately, who, in fear, have scattered in all directions and inform them that it is Bibishana who has come!\u201d", "In obedience to Sugriva\u2019s command, Jambavan perceiving it to be Bibishana and recognizing his voice, re-assured the monkeys and arrested the stampede, whereupon freed from anxiety they all retraced their steps.", "Meanwhile the faithful Bibishana, on beholding Rama\u2019s body as also Lakshmana\u2019s covered with arrows, was overcome with distress in his turn. Dipping his hand in water, he washed their eyes, but, anguish seizing his heart, he began to weep and lament, saying:\u2014", "\u201cBehold to what a pass these two powerful and valiant warriors have been brought by that titan with his crafty ways! The son of my brother, that wicked youth of perverse soul, in his demoniacal cunning, has deceived those two honourable fighters. Pierced by arrows, covered with blood, they are lying on the earth like two porcupines. Those two gallant beings, those two lions among men, on whom depended the position to which I aspired, to my destruction are lying here insensible. I am as one dead and, deprived of the hope of becoming king am lost, whilst my rival Ravana sees his vow fulfilled and his desires realised!\u201d", "Thus did Bibishana lament, whereupon Sugriva embraced him and that magnanimous King of the Monkeys spoke to him in this wise:\u2014", "\u201cO Virtuous Prince, you shalt certainly reign over Lanka; Ravana and his son will not achieve their purpose; the injury done to Rama and Lakshmana is not grave, they will both emerge from their swoon and destroy Ravana and his hordes in battle.\u201d", "When he had thus consoled and comforted the titan, Sugriva issued his commands to Sushena, his stepfather, who stood before him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cTake these two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana with the foremost of the monkey divisions to Kishkindha, till these two scourgers of their foes have recovered consciousness. As for me, I shall slay Ravana with his son and his relatives and bring back Maithili as did Shakra the prosperity he had lost.\u201d", "Thus did that King of the Monkeys speak and Sushena answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cFormerly a great war took place between the Devas and Asuras and, by making themselves invisible again and again, the Danavas overcame the Gods despite their skill in bearing arms. Experienced warriors though they were, wounded, unconscious and almost deprived of life, yet Brihaspati revived them by the aid of remedies accompanied by the recitation of sacred formulas.", "\u201cLet the monkeys, Sampati, Panasa and others go in haste to gather those simples by the ocean of milk; undoubtedly those monkeys are conversant with the two mountain herbs, the celestial Samjivakarana and Vishalya, which were created by a God. From the bosom of the milky ocean rise the Mountains Candra and Drona, where the divine \u2018Amrita\u2019 emerged after the churning, it is there that these miraculous herbs are to be found. Let the Son of the Wind, Hanuman go to those two mountains placed in that vast sea by the Gods.\u201d", "As he was speaking, a great wind arose accompanied by massed clouds and lightning, whipping up the salty waves and causing the mountains to tremble as from an earthquake. Under the mighty stroke of Vata\u2019s wing the great trees fell headlong into the briny waters of the sea, their branches broken, whilst terror seized the great snakes who inhabited these regions and those monsters plunged into the depths.", "Suddenly Garuda, the valiant son of Vinata like unto a blazing torch appeared to all those monkeys and, on beholding him, the serpents who bound those two warriors in the form of mighty arrows, fled away. Thereafter Supama, touching the two Kakutsthas and offering them his good wishes, with his hands wiped their faces that shone like the moon.", "Under Vainateya\u2019s touch, the wounds of both were closed and their bodies immediately assumed a brilliant and glowing hue. Their valour, vigour, strength, endurance and resolution, those great qualities, also perspicacity, intelligence and memory were redoubled.", "Having raised up those equals of Vasava, the exceedingly valiant Garuda embraced them warmly and Rama said to him:\u2014", "\u201cThanks to your beneficence and grace we have both been delivered from the strange evil that Ravana brought upon us and our strength has returned. As in the presence of my father Dasaratha, or my grandfather Aja, in your presence also my heart is filled with felicity. Who art you endowed with a beauty which distinguishes you, you bearing crowns, divine perfumes and celestial ornaments, the raiment which clothes you being free from dust?\u201d", "Then the extremely illustrious Vainateya, who was full of valour and the Lord of Winged Creatures, his heart enraptured, addressed Rama, whose eyes sparkled with delight, and said:\u2014", "\u201cI am your dear friend, O Kakutstha, your very breath, Garuda, who have come hither to assist you both. The mighty Asuras and exceedingly energetic monkeys as also the Gandharvas with Shatakratu at their head or the Gods themselves would not have been able to sever these formidable bonds wrought with arrows, woven with the aid of great magic by Indrajita of ruthless deeds. These offspring of Kadru of sharp fangs and subtle poison, which the potent arts of the titan had changed to arrows, had fettered you. Fortunate art you, O Virtuous Rama, you true hero, as also Lakshmana, your brother, the destroyer of his foes in combat.", "Hearing of your plight, summoning up mine energy in affection for you both, giving ear to the call of friendship alone, I came hither with all speed. Now that you are liberated from these formidable bonds let both of you be constantly on your guard! All titans by nature have recourse to treachery in war, whilst for you, O Chivalrous Warriors, honour is your only weapon. Never trust the titans on the battlefield for such perfidious means are ever employed by them.\u201d", "Having counselled him in this wise, the mighty Supama embraced Rama tenderly and craved his permission to depart, saying:\u2014", "\u201cDear and Virtuous Raghava, you are a friend to your foes, allow me to take my leave. Do not enquire indiscreetly into the cause of my friendship, O Raghava, who am as near to you as your breath, though external to you. You sbalt know of it when you have achieved success in battle, O Hero! When, under the rain of your missiles, Lanka has been destroyed save for the aged and the children and you have slain Ravana, thine adversary, you shalt bring back Sita!\u201d", "Having said this, Suparna of swift flight, who had just healed Rama\u2019s wounds in the presence of the monkeys, having paid obeisance to him and taken him into his arms, mounted into the sky with the speed of the wind.", "Seeing the two Raghavas healed of their wounds, the leaders of the monkeys, lashing their tails, roared like lions. Thereafter gongs were beaten and drums resounded, whilst conches were blown amidst general rejoicing. Some manifested their strength by breaking down the trees which they used as maces and, in their warlike frenzy, those Plavamgamas hurled themselves on the gates of Lanka.", "Thereafter a terrible and appalling clamour arose amongst the foremost of monkeys as, at the end of summer, the roaring of thunderclouds in the night.", "That formidable clamour, set up by the monkeys who were full of martial ardour, arrested the attention of Ravana and his titans, and he, hearing the joyful and spirited acclamations and the distant tumult, said to his ministers who surrounded him:\u2014\u201cA great uproar, resembling the muttering of clouds, has arisen from that horde of delighted monkeys. Undoubtedly their joy is great, their mighty shouts are agitating the ocean itself. Nevertheless whetted shafts have rendered the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, insensible, therefore this tremendous outcry almost alarms me!\u201d", "Having spoken thus to his ministers, the Lord of the Titans said to his Nairritas, who stood round him", "\u201cDo you speedily discover from what cause this general rejoicing among those forest dwellers proceeds in their present painful situation!\u201d", "At this command, the titans hastily climbed the ramparts from where they beheld the army and its leader the illustrious Sugriva with the two Raghavas also, freed of their bonds, seated in noble ease, whereupon the titans were thunderstruck. With terror in their hearts, those fierce warriors jumped down from the walls and, deadly pale, returned to their king. With downcast mien, those titans, skilled in speech, faithfully informed Ravana of those unpleasant tidings, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThe two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, whom Indrajita had bound with his benumbing shafts and whose arms he had pinioned, are freed from the arrows which paralysed them and now appear on the field of battle in their native vigour, resembling two elephants who have snapped their fetters.\u201d", "At these words, the powerful King of the Titans, full of anxiety and highly incensed, grew pale and said:\u2014", "\u201cIf mine adversaries, having thus been bound, are now free despite those formidable arrows, those rare boons resembling serpents bright as the sun, that were infallible and with which Indrajita secured them after overcoming them in combat, then mine entire authority is in jeopardy! Verily those darts, bright as fire, which in battle deprived mine enemies of life have been rendered void.\u201d", "Having uttered these words in furious tones, hissing like a snake, he addressed one named Dhumraksha who was seated amidst the titans and said:\u2014", "\u201cTaking with you a considerable force of titans go without delay and slay Rama and Lakshmana.\u201d", "At the command of that crafty monarch, Dhumraksha circumambulated him and immediately left the palace, thereafter having crossed the threshold he said to the General of the Forces:", "\u201cMobilize the army, what need is there for delay when the battle is joined!\u201d", "Thus spoke Dhumraksha and the General gathered together a large number of troops in accord with Ravana\u2019s command.", "Thereafter those prowlers of the night, who were valiant and of a formidable aspect, with girdles of bells round their waists, shouted exultantly and ranged themselves round Dhumraksha.", "Furnished with every kind of weapon, brandishing spears, hammers, maces, harpoons, sticks, iron cudgels, bars, hooks, picks, nooses and axes, those terrible titans sallied forth with the noise of thunder. Clad in mail and mounted on chariots that were magnificently dressed with flags and decorated with bands of pure gold, harnessed to mules of many heads or steeds of exceeding fleetness or elephants maddened with Mada juice, some of those titans bounded forward like veritable tigers.", "And Dhumraksha, with a great clatter set out in a celestial car to which mules with golden harness and the heads of deer and lions were hitched; and that valiant general surrounded by the titans set forth amidst mocking laughter through the western gate, where Hanuman was stationed. As he advanced in his excellent car harnessed to mules, whose voices he emulated, birds of ill-omen planed above him and on the top of his chariot a terrible vulture alighted while those devourers of corpses clustered on the point of his standard. Streaming with blood a huge decapitated and livid trunk fell to earth emitting inarticulate cries at Dhumraksha\u2019s approach and the sky rained down blood, the earth shook, the wind blew adversely with the roar of thunder and darkness obscured every quarter.", "Beholding those terrible portents that appeared in all their horror, boding ill-fortune to the titans, Dhumraksha was filled with alarm, and terror seized all the soldiers who accompanied him. At the moment when, full of fear, amidst his countless titans, eager to enter into combat, that valiant general set out, he beheld the vast army of the monkeys resembling a great flood, protected by the arms of the Raghavas.", "Seeing Dhumraksha of redoubtable courage set forth, all the monkeys in their martial ardour emitted loud cries and a terrific struggle ensued between those forest dwellers and the titans, who attacked each other with huge trees, spears and maces.", "On all sides ferocious monkeys were massacred by titans and titans felled to the earth by monkeys employing trees. The titans struck their opponents with pointed arrows furnished with heron\u2019s plumes, fearful to behold, which never missed their target and terrible maces, harpoons, axes, formidable bars and tridents of all kinds, which, brandished by them, mutilated those powerful monkeys, while they, exasperated, redoubled their efforts and, without flagging, continued the fight. Their limbs pierced with arrows, their bodies transfixed with spears, those foremost of the monkeys armed themselves with trees and rocks and, with terrific bounds, having proclaimed their names to the accompaniment of yells, crushed those intrepid titans.", "Thereafter the battle waxed exceedingly furious between monkeys and demons and the former amidst shouts of triumph seized hold of stones of every kind and trees with countless branches and rocks in order to destroy the enemy; the titans, who fed on gore, fell in heaps, vomiting blood, their sides slashed open by the trees, whilst others were crushed by the stones and yet others tom to pieces by the monkeys\u2019 teeth.", "Their standards broken, their swords snapped, their chariots overturned, they wandered about blindly and the earth was covered with the corpses of great elephants resembling hills and horses with their riders crushed by the great rocks hurled on them by those dwellers in the woods; and the monkeys of exceeding valour rushed on the titans, flinging themselves upon them with great bounds and scratching their feces with their sharp nails.", "Mutilated, their hair tom out, maddened by the smell of blood, the titans fell in great numbers; some of those fierce warriors however, in a paroxysm of fury hurled themselves on the monkeys and struck them with the palms of their hands, which resounded like the clap of thunder, and the monkeys, receiving that sharp shock, with an even greater ferocity crushed the titans with blows of their feet, teeth and trees.", "Seeing his army routed, Dhumraksha, that lion among the titans, in his rage, began to create camage among those bellicose apes and some pierced with spears lost rivers of blood whilst others, struck down by the blows of the axe, fell to earth.", "Here some were crushed by iron bars, others tom by harpoons or pierced by javelins, stumbled and fell, yielding up their vital breaths. Mowed down, covered with blood, put to flight, those inhabitants of the woods fell dying under the furious onslaught of the titans in the struggle. Their breasts tom open they lay on their side or, slashed with tridents, their entrails gushed forth.", "Then that mighty conflict took on fearful proportions by virtue of the number of monkeys and titans who took part and the innumerable darts, stones and trees that were used. With the bowstrings as the tuneful lute, the neighing of the horses, the clapping of the hands and the trumpeting of the elephants as the melody, the whole battle resembled a symphony.", "Meanwhile Dhumraksha, armed with his bow, in the forefront of battle, under a hail of missiles, dispersed the monkeys as in sport on every side, and Maruti, beholding the monkey army being exterminated and put to flight by that titan, hurled himself upon him in fury, a great rock in his hand. His eyes inflamed with anger, the equal of his sire in courage, he flung the rock on the chariot of his foe and seeing the stone fall, Dhumraksha, brandishing his mace, in his agitation leapt quickly from the car to the ground. Then that rock rolled on the earth, having shattered the chariot with its wheels, its pole, its shafts, banner and Dhumraksha\u2019s bow.", "Thereafter Hanuman, born of Maruta, leaving the car lying, slew the titans with the trunks of trees furnished with their branches, and their heads crushed, covered with blood, mangled by those trees, they fell to the earth.", "Having routed the army of the enemy, Hanuman, born of Mamta, breaking off the peak of a mountain hurled himself on Dhumraksha, who, brandishing his mace, rushed on his adversary and he advanced with haste towards him shouting. Then Dhumraksha, in his rage, brought down that weapon studded with countless points on the head of the infuriated Hanuman and assailed by that violent and fearful stroke, the monkey, who was endowed with the strength of Mamta, was in no wise disturbed but struck the titan full on the skull with his rocky peak which shattered all his limbs, whereupon Dhumraksha suddenly fell to the earth like a mountain crumbling.", "Beholding him slain, the night-rangers who had survived the slaughter, terrified, re-entered Lanka, harassed by the Plavamgamas.", "The illustrious son of Pavana, however, having destroyed his enemies, causing rivers of blood to flow, weary of slaughter, with delight received the cordial felicitations of the monkey leaders.", "Hearing of the death of Dhumraksha, Ravana the King of the Titans fell into a transport of fury and began to hiss like a serpent. Wrought up with ire, with long and burning sighs he addressed the exceedingly powerful Vajradamshtra, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Warrior, go forth at the head of the titans and triumph over the son of Dasaratha, Rama, as also over Sugriva and die monkeys!\u201d", "\u201cBe it so!\u201d answered the general who was versed in the art of magic, and he departed speedily with the innumerable divisions that surrounded him.", "With the utmost care he assembled teams of elephants, horses, donkeys and mules, adorning them with countless flags of different colours, and that titan, wearing bracelets and a diadem of great price, set out immediately, bearing his bow and, having circumambulated his chariot dressed with pennants, which dazzled the gaze with its facings of pure gold, he ascended it.", "Thereafter infantry of every kind issued forth, furnished with weapons, such as cutlasses, innumerable darts, gleaming maces, harpoons, bows, lances, spears, swords, discus, hammers and sharp axes. All those illustrious lions among the titans in their resplendent and many-coloured uniforms, full of ardour mounted on elephants intoxicated with ichor, resembled moving hills. Their mounts equipped for combat, driven by mahouts bearing lances and goads, were headed by those distinguished for their trappings and great strength.", "And the whole army of titans filed out, looking as brilliant as the clouds riven by lightning in the rainy season and they emerged from the northern gate where the General Angada was stationed.", "Thereafter, as they set forth, fearful portents appeared and, from a cloudless yet burning sky, meteors fell while jackals, emitting fearful howls, belched forth flames and fire. Hideous beasts foretold the destruction of the titans who entered into the combat stumbling miserably.", "Yet despite those ill-omens, the mighty Vajradamshtra, full of energy and prowess, went forward eager to meet the foe and, seeing their adversaries advancing, the monkeys, burning for victory, set up tremendous shouts which echoed in every quarter.", "Thereafter a furious struggle ensued between the monkeys and the titans and those redoubtable warriors of ferocious aspect sought to bring about each other\u2019s destruction. Some of those warriors, their heads and bodies severed, fell to the earth bathed in blood, whilst others, whose arms resembled steel, approached one another, attacking with various weapons, neither giving ground. Trees, stones and javelins clashed with a tremendous noise, striking terror in the heart of the listeners and the appalling clatter of chariot wheels, the twanging of bow-strings, the blare of trumpets, the roll of drums, the booming of gongs, created an indescribable uproar.", "Then, throwing away their weapons, they wrestled with one another in hand-to-hand combat, striking each other with the palms of their hands, their feet, their knees and even with trees. Some of the titans had their bodies torn open, some were crushed by rocks and some were beaten down by the blows of the monkeys in the fight.", "Now Vajradamshtra, having surveyed the scene, began to sow terror among the monkeys, as Antaka, noose in hand, at the destruction of the worlds.", "Full of vigour, those skilled warriors, the titans, transported with rage, decimated the monkey forces with every kind of weapon and, on his side the audacious son of Vayu struck down all those titans in the fight, fury re-doubling his strength, so that he appeared like the Fire of Dissolution. Then the valiant Angada, the equal of Shakra in valour, brandishing a tree, his eyes red with anger, like a lion amidst defenceless deer, caused a terrible carnage. By the force of his blows, the titans of redoubtable courage, their skulls crushed, fell like trees under the blows of the axe and the earth, strewn with chariots of every kind, standards, horses, bodies of monkeys and titans and rivers of blood, was fearful to behold. Strings of pearls, bracelets, raiment, and parasols decorated the battlefield, which glowed like an autumnal night and the tempestuous Angada scattered the great army of the titans as the wind dispels the clouds.", "The extermination of his army through Angada\u2019s prowess filled the valiant Vajradamshtra with fury. Stretching his formidable bow, like unto Shakra\u2019s thunderbolt, he assailed the monkey battalions with a hail of shafts whereupon the foremost of the titans mounted on chariots, armed with every kind of weapon and full of courage, entered the lists whilst the monkeys, those powerful bulls among the Plavagas, assembling on all sides, fought with rocks.", "Thousands of weapons were hurled in that desperate encounter by the titan and monkey leaders and, from their side, the great monkeys with the ardour of elephants in rut, showered down giant trees and huge lumps of rock on the demons so that between those intrepid warriors, the titans and the monkeys, who never retreated in battle, a tremendous struggle ensued.", "Monkeys and titans, still possessing heads but bereft of arms and legs, lay on the earth bathed in blood and bristling with arrows, a prey to herons, vultures and crows or devoured by troops of jackals.", "Monkeys and night-rangers fell on the battlefield; headless trunks leapt up to the terror of all, their arms, hands and heads severed and their limbs hacked to pieces in the fight.", "Meanwhile the army of Vajradamshtra, overcome by the monkeys, broke up under his eyes, whereupon that leader, seeing the titans terrorised and decimated by die Plavamgamas, his eyes red with anger, bow in hand, penetrated the enemy ranks, sowing panic amongst them. Thereafter he dispatched those monkeys with arrows furnished with heron\u2019s plumes that flew straight to their target and pierced seven, eight, nine or five of his opponents simultaneously, thus destroying them in his fury. Put to flight, those simian battalions, their limbs crippled by those darts, sought refuge with Angada as all creatures with Prajapati; and when he beheld those monkey divisions fleeing in disorder, the son of Bali exchanged glances of hatred with Vajradamshtra and, in a paroxysm of rage, they entered into a terrible duel one with the other so that it seemed a lion and an elephant intoxicated with ichor fought together. And the son of Bali full of valour, was struck in his vital parts by a hundred thousand arrows resembling tongues of fire and all his limbs were besprinkled with blood. Then that exceedingly energetic monkey of redoubtable courage hurled a tree at Vajradamshtra but that intrepid titan, seeing it fall, cut it into innumerable pieces which fell in heaps on the earth.", "Witnessing the strength of his rival, that lion among the Plavagas seized hold of a huge rock which he spun round, emitting a shout and, as it descended, that hero leaping down from his chariot, armed with his mace, stood waiting unperturbed. Meanwhile that rock discharged by Angada fell on the forefront of the battle where it shattered the chariot with its wheels, shafts and horses.", "Then the monkey broke off a great crag from the mountain once more and it was covered with trees and he brought it down on the head of his adversary so that Vajradamshtra, seized with a sudden giddiness, faltered and began to vomit blood, clenching his mace convulsively and breathing heavily. Thereafter, coming to his senses, in a transport of fury he hit the son of Bali full on the chest with his mace and, letting it fall, began to fight with his fists whereupon a hand-to-hand struggle ensued between monkey and titan. Exhausted by the blows, spitting blood, those valiant warriors resembled the planets Mars and Mercury.", "Meanwhile the exceedingly powerful Angada, that lion of Plavagas stood waiting and he seized hold of a shield covered with the hide of a bull and a great sword decorated with golden bells enveloped in a leathern sheath.", "In the midst of innumerable graceful evolutions, the monkey and the titan attacked each other, roaring and thirsting for victory. With their gaping wounds, they shone like two Kimshuka Trees in flower and the struggle robbed them of their breath so that they sank to their knees on the earth. Thereafter in the twinkling of an eye, Angada, that elephant among monkeys, rose up, his eyes inflamed like a serpent that has been struck with a stick and, with his stainless sword that was well sharpened, the son of Bali who was full of vigour, struck off the huge head of Vajradamshtra, whose limbs were bathed in blood. Under the stroke of that sword, his beautiful head fell, cleft in twain, the eyes rolling.", "Beholding Vajradamshtra slain, the titans, wild with terror, fled panic-stricken towards Lanka, harassed by the Plavamgamas, their faces woe-begone, their heads bowed in shame.", "Having struck down the enemy with his powerful arm, the mighty son of Bah experienced great joy amidst the monkey army, honoured by them for his high courage and he resembled the God of a Thousand Eyes surrounded by the Celestials.", "Hearing that Vajradamshtra had been slain by the son of Bah, Ravana addressed the General of his forces who, with joined palms, stood near him and said:\u2014", "\u201cLet the invincible titans of irresistible courage go forth immediately with Akampana at their head, who is conversant with the use of every weapon and missile; he excels in vanquishing the foe and in preserving and leading his own forces; he has ever desired my welfare and loved war; he will prove victorious over the two Kakutsthas and the exceedingly energetic Sugriva. The rest of the monkeys too are formidable but without doubt he will exterminate them all.\u201d", "At this command from Ravana, the valiant titan, in great haste, mobilized an entire division of the army. Furnished with every kind of weapon, those foremost of titans of terrifying aspect, fearful to look upon, rushed into the fray where their general had despatched them.", "Akampana of the stature and colour of a cloud, whose voice resembled thunder, ascended his car decorated with fine gold and set out surrounded by dreadful demons. He, who was incapable of trembling in battle even before the Gods themselves, seemed to the monkeys to be as splendid as the sun. As he sped on his way, furious and eager to enter into combat, the horses drawing his chariot were suddenly deprived of their energy and the left eye of that one who delighted in warfare began to twitch. His countenance grew pale, his voice trembled, the day which had seemed so fair became threatening and a bitter wind began to blow. Birds and beasts uttered mournful cries but that titan, who had the shoulders of a lion and the agility of a tiger, disregarding those portents, rushed towards the battlefield and, as he went forward with his troops, an immense tumult arose that seemed to convulse the ocean and the sound appalled the simian army, who, furnished with trees, prepared to enter into combat.", "Thereafter a fearful struggle ensued between monkeys and demons and, ready to sacrifice their lives in the cause of Rama and Ravana, those monkey and titan warriors of exceeding valour, who resembled hills, contended with each other and, the yells they emitted in the thick of the fight and the shouts of defiance that they let forth in their rage created an indescribable clamour. A thick coppery dust, raised by the monkeys and the titans enveloped the whole horizon and, in the midst of that yellow cloud resembling silk which covered them, the combatants could no longer distinguish each other on the field. Neither standard, banner, shield, weapon nor chariot could be discerned in that pall of dust and the terrific clamour of warriors challenging and rushing upon each other was appalling to hear, yet in the confusion no form was visible.", "In that fight monkeys fell under the blows of enraged monkeys, titans massacred titans in the darkness; Plavagas and demons slew foe and friend, and the earth drenched with gore was thick with mud.", "Under the rain of blood the dust was laid, revealing the earth covered with corpses. Then the monkeys and titans assailed each other with blows from trees, spears, maces, javelins, stones, bars and picks, wrestling with their adversaries who resembled mountains. In that encounter those monkeys slew the titans of dreadful deeds and they, transported with rage, bearing darts and javelins in their hands, destroyed the monkeys with their cruel weapons.", "Thereafter Akampana, the leader of the titans, full of ire, consoled all those fierce and valiant soldiers; the monkeys however, leaping upon them, shattered their weapons and crushed those titans with blows from trees and stones.", "At that instant, the courageous monkey Leaders, Kumuda, Nala and Mainda, in a paroxysm of rage, as in sport, with mighty bounds and blows of trees created a great carnage amongst the titans and all those lions among the monkeys brought about complete disorder in the enemy ranks with their countless missiles.", "Witnessing this great exploit executed by the monkey leaders, Akampana was seized with violent anger and his features became distorted. Brandishing his powerful bow, he addressed his charioteer in these words:\u2014", "\u201cDrive the chariot with all speed to that place, for those warriors are slaying countless titans on the battlefield. Those arrogant monkeys of exceeding ferocity, armed with trees and rocks, dare to affront me! I shall exterminate those audacious warriors who are seen sowing confusion in the ranks of the titans!\u201d", "Thereupon, in his chariot drawn by fast-moving horses, Akampana, the most skilful of car-warriors, with a hail of darts, overwhelmed the monkeys so that they were no longer able to maintain their formation nor for this reason could they fight and, crushed under the shafts of the titan, the confusion became general.", "Then the valiant Hanuman, seeing them fall under the sway of death, pursued by Akampana\u2019s darts, went to the rescue of his companions and, beholding that great Plavaga, those lions among the monkeys rallied and, in the field, grouped themselves boldly round him. Observing his courage, those foremost of the monkeys took heart in the shelter of his valour.", "Meanwhile Akampana, like unto a second Mahendra, caused a hail of arrows to descend on Hanuman who remained as firm as a rock, heedless of the weapons that fell upon his body, and that exceedingly courageous monkey resolved to slay his adversary and, with peals of laughter, the impetuous son of Maruta leapt on the titan, causing the earth to shake as it were, while burning with energy he emitted yells, so that it was impossible to look upon him as it is impossible to gaze on a fire in a brazier.", "Finding himself without weapons, that foremost one among the monkeys, in the fury that possessed him, tore up a rock and seizing a huge crag with one hand, Maruti, letting forth a roar, began to spin it rapidly thereafter hurling it at the Titan Leader Akampana, as formerly in the encounter, Purandara hurled his thunderbolt at Namuchi.", "Akampana, however, seeing that crag flying towards him, shattered it from a distance by means of great crescent-shaped darts. Beholding that rocky peak shattered in the air by the titan\u2019s arrows and falling in pieces, Hanuman became mad with anger and observing an Ashvakarna Tree as large as a mountain, in the transport of rage that possessed him, that monkey uprooted it with violence and taking hold of that tree of immense branches, in his great strength, brandished it exultantly. Then he began to run with great strides, breaking down the trees in his haste and, in the excess of his fury, tearing up the earth with his feet; and he struck down elephants as also those who rode upon them and charioteers with their cars and the formidable titan infantry.", "Seeing Hanuman, like unto Antaka, the Destroyer of Vital Breaths, full of wrath, armed with a tree, the titans took to flight. Thereupon the valiant Akampana beholding that enraged monkey sowing terror amongst his soldiers, greatly perturbed, set up a mighty shout and, with fourteen pointed arrows that tore the flesh, he pierced the exceedingly powerful Hanuman.", "Riddled with sharp-pointed iron shafts, that simian warrior resembled a mountain covered with forests and, like unto a flowering Ashoka Tree, he shone like a smokeless flame. Uprooting another tree, with a prodigious bound he struck the head of the Titan General a fearful blow and, by that stroke with which that Indra among Monkeys smote him in his fury, Akampana fell dead.", "Seeing their leader lying lifeless on the earth, all the titans trembled as trees when the earth quakes. Put to flight, all those warriors, throwing away their arms, escaped in the direction of Lanka, terrified, pursued by the monkeys. Their hair loosened, panic-stricken, their pride broken by defeat, their limbs dripping with sweat, in their bewilderment, they fled in confusion. Thereafter, mad with fear, looking back continually, crushing each other in their haste, they entered the city.", "And when those titans had entered Lanka, those exceedingly powerful monkeys surrounded Hanuman in order to pay homage to him and the mighty Hanuman, of noble nature, honoured them all in accord with their rank.", "Then the triumphant monkeys shouted with might and main and once more pursued the titans with the intention of slaying them while that great Plavaga, born of Maruta, returning to his own companions, having slain the titan, enjoyed the same renown in battle as Vishnu when he overcame the mighty Asura of immense power in the forefront of the fight.", "Thereafter that monkey received the homage of the Gods and of Rama himself as also that of the exceedingly valiant Lakshmana and the Plavamgamas led by Sugriva and the great-souled Bibishana.", "Hearing of Akampana\u2019s death, the irascible Lord of the Titans with a downcast mien, took counsel with his ministers and, having reflected awhile and deliberated with them, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, passed the forenoon in inspecting the defences; and the King passed through that city, decorated with banners and flags, guarded by the titans and filled with innumerable troops.", "Seeing Lanka beseiged, Ravana, the Sovereign of the Titans, said to the devoted Prahasta, a skilled soldier:\u2014", "\u201cThis city thus beleaguered and hard pressed, O Skilful Warrior, may only be delivered by myself, Kumbhakama, you, who art in command of the army, Indrajita or Nikumbha; none else could undertake such a task!", "\u201cTaking a company of warriors, do you speedily place thyself in their midst and set forth in order to triumph over those inhabitants of the woods. In this sortie, as soon as the army of monkeys hear the uproar created by the titans, they will disperse. Volatile, undisciplined and fickle, the monkeys will not be able to endure your cry, any more than an elephant can endure the roaring of a lion. His army routed, Rama with Saumitri, robbed of further authority, will fall into your power, O Prahasta.", "\u201cA hypothetical misfortune is preferable to one that is certain! Whether it be unpleasing to hear or no, say what you considerest to be to our advantage!\u201d", "Thus addressed by that Indra among Titans, Prahasta, the leader of the army, answered him as Ushanas the King of the Asuras, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO King, formerly we discussed this matter with the wise and, after examining the different points of view, a disagreement arose between us.To return Sita was what I considered the most advantageous course, not to do so, meant war; we forsaw this.", "\u201cI have ever been heaped with gifts and honours by you as also with every mark of friendship. When the opportunity arises, is it not for me to render you a service? Nay, I shall neither spare life, children, wife nor wealth! Know me to be ready to sacrifice my life in thine interest in battle!\u201d", "Having spoken thus to his brother, the General Prahasta said to his leading officers who stood before him:\u2014", "\u201cGather a large army together immediately; to-day the flesh-eating birds and beasts shall feed on the enemy that I strike down on the battlefield with my swift arrows!\u201d", "At this command those highly powerful leaders assembled the forces in the abode of the King of the Titans. In an instant, Lanka was filled with redoubtable warriors like unto elephants, furnished with weapons of every kind.", "While they propitiated the God who feeds on offerings and paid homage to rite brahmins, a fragrant breeze, bearing the scent of clarified butter, began to blow and the titans, all ready for battle, taking hold of garlands of every kind, adorned themselves with delight. Thereafter, armed with bows and mail, they set out in their chariots at a brisk pace, their eyes turned towards their King, Ravana. And they ranged themselves round Prahasta whilst he paid obeisance to his Sovereign to the beating of a gong of dreadful sound, whereafter, with his weapons, that general ascended his chariot that was furnished with all that was needful, harnessed to exceedingly swift steeds, skilfully driven and in perfect condition.", "Rumbling like a great cloud, shining like the moon itself, unapproachable as the serpent that served as its standard, solidly and artistically constructed, decorated with a net of pure gold, smiling as it were in its magnificence, such was the car in which Prahasta, having received Ravana\u2019s command, stood.", "Then the titan set out from Lanka immediately in the midst of a powerful army and, at his departure, a rolling of drums, resembling the roar of Par janya, and a blast of fanfares arose that seemed to fill the earth and, with the blare of conches, the titans advanced, creating a terrible uproar.", "Narantaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunata, colossal giants, his adjutants, surrounded Prahasta who emerged from the eastern gate in the midst of an immense, formidable and powerful army resembling a herd of elephants and, in the centre of that force, vast as the sea, Prahasta in his fury appeared like Death at the end of the world, whilst the uproar, that arose on his setting forth with his titans raising their war cries, drew a sinister answering call from all creatures.", "In a cloudless sky, birds of prey advancing to meet the chariot, circled from left to right; fearful jackals vomited forth fire and flames, howling lugubriously; a meteor fell from heaven and the wind blew chill; planets, in opposition to each other, lost their brilliance whilst clouds with a raucous sound showered blood on Prahasta\u2019s car with which his attendants were bespattered; a croaking vulture, facing the south, alighted on the top of his standard depriving that titan of his lustre. His charioteer, who never turned back in battle, despite his skill, again and again allowed the goad to fall from his hand. The brilliance of that sortie of incomparable pomp vanished in an instant and the horses stumbled on the even ground.", "Beholding Prahasta, renowned for his martial valour, advancing to give battle, the army of monkeys, furnished with weapons of every kind, went forward to meet him and a formidable clamour arose amongst them as they tore up the trees and seized hold of great rocks.", "Thereafter the titans yelled and the monkeys roared, both armies being filled with ardour and, in their fury and zeal and their impatience to slay each other, they challenged one another with tremendous shouts.", "Meanwhile Prahasta advanced on the forces of the monkeys whom in his folly he imagined he would destroy and, with an impetuous bound, he hurled himself upon that army as a grasshopper falls into a flame.", "Beholding Prahasta setting out with martial ardour, the Conqueror Rama, smiling, enquired of Bibishana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWho is this colossus surrounded by an immense army, who with such speed, valour and courage, advances so swiftly? Make known to me this brave ranger of the night.\u201d", "On this enquiry, Bibishana answered:\u2014", "\u201cPrahasta is the name of this titan; he is the leader of the army; a third of the forces belonging to the King of the Titans accompanies him. He is courageous, a master of the science of weapons and a warrior renowned for his prowess.\u201d", "While the terrible Prahasta of formidable exploits advanced roaring, that colossus, surrounded by his troops, was observed by the great and powerful army of the monkeys who began to emit cries of defiance.", "Swords, lances, daggers, spears, darts, maces, bludgeons, bars, javelins and axes of every kind with many different bows glittered in the hands of the titans who, desirous of victory, fell upon the monkeys.", "Trees in flower, rocks, huge and heavy stones were the weapons of the Plavamgamas, who were burning to fight and, as they approached each other, a formidable struggle arose between those innumerable combatants, who showered down a hail of stones and arrows. In the conflict, countless titans caused the death of thousands of mighty monkeys and countless monkeys destroyed as many titans. Some of the combatants fell under the lances, others under great arrows, some were struck down by the blows of bars, others cloven by axes. Deprived of their life\u2019s breath they lay on the earth their hearts transfixed or cut to pieces by the avalanche of missiles. And those monkeys fell on the earth cut in two by the strokes of swords, their sides torn open by those bold titans and they, on their part, full of fury, overthrew the enemy ranks, heaping the earth with them, and they struck at them with trees and crags, administering thundering slaps and terrific blows with their fists, so that the titans, blinded, their faces ashen, vomited blood.", "Thereafter an appalling clamour arose and, amidst cries of pain and leonine roars, the monkeys and titans, each maddened, their features distorted, following the path of heroes, conducted themselves with great courage. Narantaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata, Prahasta\u2019s companions, decimated those inhabitants of the woods, hurling themselves on the monkeys in rage, destroying them; and Dvivida struck down one of them named Narantaka; then the ape Durmukha, leaping up in his turn, with a ready hand, struck Samunnata with a great tree; Jambavan, in the height of anger, seizing a huge stone hurled it with force on Mahanada\u2019s chest and, on his side, the valiant Kumbhahanu, having attacked the General Tara, who was armed with a huge tree, received a blow that cost him his life.", "Infuriated by the quadruple murder, Prahasta, who stood in his chariot, with the bow held in his hand, caused a dreadful havoc amongst the monkeys and the two armies became a vortex, resembling a roaring tempest over a vast ocean. In that great battle, the titan, intoxicated with combat, in his fury annihilated the monkeys under an immense avalanche of arrows. The corpses of monkeys and titans heaped the ground and covered it like hideous mountains and the earth, running with the blood which inundated it, shone as in the month of Spring when covered by the blossoming Palasha Trees.", "With the heaps of warriors for its banks, the broken weapons its trees, the torrents of blood its huge waves, death appeared like an ocean receiving its floods; livers and spleens its mire, entrails its moss, severed heads and trunks the fish, and morsels of flesh the grass, innumerable vultures its lovely swans, herons its geese, covered as it was with fat for the foam, the tumult the sound of its waters, the battlefield resembled a river, incapable of being crossed, visited by waterfowl at the end of the rainy season. And the foremost of the titans and the monkeys crossed over that impassable river as elephants lead their herds across a lake that the lotuses have covered with pollen.", "Meanwhile Prahasta, standing in his chariot, letting fly countless shafts scattering the Plavamgamas, was observed by Nila and, like unto a violent wind, the General of the Titans beheld Nila advancing on him like a mass of clouds in the sky.", "Directing his chariot bright as the sun towards him, that foremost of archers, stretching his bow in the midst of the fray, covered Nila with his barbed shafts, which, piercing him in their rapid flight, passed through his body and, like furious serpents, buried themselves in the earth with great spurts. When Nila was wounded by those pointed shafts resembling tongues of fire, that huge and mighty monkey, brandishing a tree, struck that exceedingly redoubtable Prahasta who had set upon him with such fury.", "Roaring with anger under his blows, that lion among titans overwhelmed the monkey chief with a rain of arrows and the shower of missiles loosed by that cruel demon was received by the monkey with closed eyes. Like a bull standing under a sudden autumnal downpour, so under that intolerable rain of darts, Nila immediately closed his eyes, suffering it, though it was scarce to be endured. Mad with rage, under the hail of arrows, that great and mighty monkey, arming himself with a Sala Tree, struck down Prahasta\u2019s horses and thereafter his heart surging with anger he severed the bow of that barbarian, shouting again and again.", "Deprived of his bow, Prahasta, the leader of the army, seizing a formidable mace, leapt down from his chariot, and those two generals, facing each other, adversaries full of courage, their limbs covered with blood, like unto two elephants with broken tusks, tore each other with their sharp teeth. Lion and tiger in gait, lion and tiger in prowess, those two warriors, vanquishers of other heroes, intrepid combatants, thirsting for fame, resembled Vritra and Vasava.", "Meanwhile Prahasta with a supreme effort struck Nila on the forehead with his mace, causing the blood to flow, whereupon that powerful monkey, his limbs covered with gore, seized a great tree and struck Prahasta full in the chest with fury. He, however, not heeding the impact, brandishing an enormous iron bar, hurled himself on the valiant Plavamgama. Seeing him advancing towards him with terrific bounds, full of rage, the mighty monkey Nila, snatched up a great rock which he swiftly threw at the head of his bellicose opponent armed with a mace. Loosed by that monkey chief, that immense and formidable stone broke into several pieces on Prahasta\u2019s head and the titan, deprived of breath, lustre, strength and consciousness instantly fell on the earth, like a tree severed at the root.", "From his riven head and body the blood flowed, so that it resembled a torrent falling from a mountain.

Dumb and dispirited, plunged in an ocean of burning grief, they appeared to have lost their wits.", "The triumphant warrior Nila, however, on his return, was honoured by Rama with Lakshmana who accompanied him, and experienced supreme joy.", "[Full title: Ravana\u2019s Prowess; Rama overcomes him but grants him his Life].", "Their General having succumbed in the fight against the foremost of the monkeys, the heavily armed forces of the King of the Titans took to flight with the speed of the tide.", "Coming before their lord, they apprised him of the death of their leader who had fallen under the blows of the Fire-god\u2019s offspring, and at these tidings, the king was transported with anger. Learning that Prahasta had perished in the fight, his heart was filled with grief and he addressed the foremost of his leaders, as Indra those who never grow old1 and said:\u2014", "\u201cThat foe is not to be despised, under whose blows the destroyer of Indra\u2019s host, the leader of my army with his followers and elephants, fell. I myself shall enter this strange battlefield without hesitation in order to obtain victory and destroy the enemy. As a forest is consumed by fire, so shall I to-day with a myriad arrows burn up the simian army with Rama and Lakshmana.\u201d", "Speaking thus, that enemy of the Lord of the Celestials ascended his chariot which shone like a flame and was yoked to a team of horses, its brilliance increased by the splendour of his person.", "The sound of trumpets, gongs, drums and leonine roars accompanied by the clapping of hands, acclamations and hymns of praise, frenziedly greeted the departure of the Sovereign of the Titans. Those eaters of flesh, resembling mountains or clouds, whose glances flashed like torches, surrounded the supreme Leader of the Titans as he marched out, like unto the Bhutas escorting Rudra, the Lord of the Immortals. Issuing from the city, that monarch observed the army of ferocious monkeys with trees and rocks in their hands, ready for combat, roaring like a vast ocean or a mass of thunder clouds.", "Seeing the demon divisions seething with fury, the incomparably illustrious Rama, whose arms resembled great serpents, accompanied by his forces, said to Bibishana:\u2014", "\u201cWho is in command of this army furnished with every kind of standard, banner and canopy, armed with javelins, swords, stakes and other weapons and missiles, that is indomitable and composed of intrepid soldiers and elephants as high as the Mahendra Mountain?\u201d", "Thus interrogated, Bibishana, the equal of Shakra in valour, pointed out the principal leaders of those courageous lions among the titans to him and said:\u2014", "\u201cThat hero of coppery hue mounted on the back of an elephant, causing its head to sway, the rival of the rising sun, know, O Prince, to be Akampana.", "\u201cHe who, standing in his chariot, brandishes his bow which resembles Shakra\u2019s, whose standard bears the image of a lion and who is like unto an elephant with its long curved tusks, is Indrajita, who is renowned for the boons he has received from Brahma.", "\u201cThat archer yonder, like unto the Vindhya, Asta or Mahendra Mountains, standing in his car, a mighty warrior, who wields a bow of unequalled size, is called Atikaya on account of his immense stature.", "\u201cThe tawny-eyed warrior resembling the dawn, riding a wild elephant with its bells jangling, who is shouting aloud, is Mahodara.", "\u201cThe rider of the brilliantly caparisoned steed he, who is armed with a gleaming javelin and resembles a mass of evening clouds, whose fury rivals the lightning and possesses the velocity of a well-directed thunder-bolt, who is seated on the foremost of bulls and shines like the moon, is Trishiras. The other, resembling a thunder-cloud, of large and well-developed chest, who is twanging his bow and has the King of the Snakes as his standard, is Kumbha.", "\u201cThe one who carries a mace decorated with gold and diamonds from which flames and smoke issue, who advances as a standard bearer to the titan army, is Nikumbha of prodigious exploits.", "\u201cThat warrior in a chariot adorned with flags, gleaming like a glowing brazier, who is furnished with bows, swords and arrows, is Narantaka, who, in combat, fights with mountain peaks.", "\u201cFinally the one who appears surrounded by spectres of dreadful form with heads of tigers, buffalo, mighty elephants, deer and horses, riding under a white canopy with a slender handle, his diadem resembling the moon, he who is the humbler of the Gods themselves, like unto Rudra amidst the Bhutas is the mighty Lord of the Titans himself. His countenance is graced by swinging earrings, his formidable stature equals the Vindhya, that Lord of Mountains, he who brought Mahendra and Vaivasvat low, is the King of the Titans, equal to the sun in splendour.\u201d", "Then Rama, the subduer of his foes answered Bibishana and said:\u2014", "\u201cAh! What glory, what exceeding majesty is Ravana\u2019s, the Lord of the Titans! As one cannot gaze on the sun, neither can the eye rest on him, such is the blinding strength of his magnificence! Neither Devas, Danavas nor heroes possess a body equal to his! Who can rival the brilliance of the King of the Titans? All are as high as hills, all have crags as their weapons, all are furnished with fiery darts. The Lord of the Titans stands out among those ardent warriors as Antaka amidst the impetuous Bhutas of strange form. It is to his destruction that that wretch comes to-day within my sight 1 To-day I shall slake my wrath born of Sita\u2019s abduction!\u201d", "At these words, the valiant Rama who was accompanied by Lakshmana, took up his bow and, standing erect, placed an arrow, the most powerful of all, upon it.", "Meanwhile the haughty Monarch of the Titans said to his brave troops\u2022", "\u201cTake up your positions unfalteringly at the gates and principal exits, the outposts and fortifications.

Seizing that rock covered with innumerable trees, he hurled it at that prowler of the night, who, seeing it flying towards him, broke it in pieces with his golden-stemmed arrows. That huge and high peak covered with trees being shattered, fell on the earth, and the Lord of the Titans, like unto another Antaka, selected a dart resembling a great serpent. Taking up that arrow, which rivalled Anila in velocity and possessed the brilliance of fire and the force of lightning, he loosed it with fury on Sugriva in order to slay him, and that weapon, equal to Shakra\u2019s thunderbolt, loosed by Ravana\u2019s arm, penetrated Sugriva\u2019s breast in its flight as formerly Guha\u2019s spear when he discharged it at the Krauncha Mountain.", "Wounded by that missile which bereft him of consciousness, that warrior fell moaning to the earth. Beholding him stretched on the ground deprived of his senses, the Yatudhanas raised a shout of triumph.", "Thereupon Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sushena as well as Rishabha, Jyotirmukha and Nala, of exceeding corpulence, tearing up rocks, hurled themselves on the King of the Titans. Then that Lord of the Titans, with hundreds of arrows possessed of sharp points, rendered their projectiles fruitless and pierced those leaders of the monkeys with a hail of marvellous golden-shafted arrows.", "Under the blows with which the Enemy of the Gods assailed them, those generals of terrifying stature were overcome, whereupon he covered that formidable army of monkeys with a shower of arrows.", "Assailed and wounded, those warriors emitted cries of terror and pain, and those deer of the branches, whom Ravana was destroying with his darts, fled for refuge to the intrepid Rama, whereupon that mighty and skilful archer, Raghava, seizing a weapon, set out at once. Lakshmana however, approaching him with joined palms, addressed him in moving tones, and said:\u2014", "\u201cTruly, O Noble Brother, I am able to slay this wretch! It is I who will destroy him, do you give me leave, O Lord!\u201d", "Then the exceedingly powerful Rama, a true hero, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cGo, O Lakshmana, and in this duel may your valour prevail! Without doubt Ravana is endowed with great strength, he is a warrior of outstanding prowess; the Three Worlds themselves could not withstand his fury; seek out his weak points and guard against thine own; be ever vigilant and defend thyself with eye and bow!\u201d", "Thus spoke Raghava and Saumitri embraced him, thereafter offering obeisance to him and bidding him farewell, he entered the lists. There he beheld Ravana with arms as large as the trunks of elephants, who was brandishing his dread and fiery bow, covering the monkeys, whose limbs he had severed with a close rain of darts.", "Beholding this, the exceedingly energetic Hanuman, born of Maruta, in order to bring that rain of arrows to an end, rushed on Ravana and, approaching his chariot, lifted his right arm and threatened him; thereafter the sagacious Hanuman addressed him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou have obtained the boon of invulnerability to Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas and also Rakshasas but the monkeys are a danger to you! This five-branched hand of mine, which I now raise, will rob you of the life that has long been resident in your body!\u201d", "At these words of Hanuman, the exceedingly valiant Ravana, his eyes inflamed with anger, answered:\u2014", "\u201cStrike swiftly without fear! Win eternal renown, having measured your strength with mine, I shall destroy you I\u201d", "Then the son of the Wind answered Ravana who spoke thus, saying:\u2014", "\u201cRecollect that I have slain your son Aksha already I\u201d", "At this, the powerful Lord of the Titans struck the son of Anila a violent blow with the palm of his hand and the monkey reeled; thereafter the mighty and illustrious Hanuman recovered his balance and, steadying himself, struck that enemy of the Immortals in fury. Under the violent impact of the monkey\u2019s blow, Dashagriva shook like a mountain when the earth trembles.", "Seeing Ravana struck in the fight, Rishis, Siddhas and monkeys raised a great shout, as also the Devas, Suras and Asuras.", "Then the extremely spirited Ravana, having regained his breath, said:\u2014", "\u201cWell done! Well done! O Monkey, you are an adversary worthy of praise!\u201d", "Thus did he speak, and Maruti answered him, saying:\u2014\u201cCursed be that strength since you dost still survive, O Ravana! Now come, enter into a decisive struggle with me, O Perverse Wretch! Why this boasting? My fist is about to despatch you to the abode of Yama 1\u201d", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s words, the powerful Ravana, enraged, his eyes red with fury, whirling his fist with force brought it down violently on the monkey\u2019s chest and, under the shock, Hanuman reeled once more, whilst the King of the Titans, Dashagriva, that exceedingly fiery warrior, seeing his valiant opponent bereft of strength, turned his chariot towards Nila. With his arrows, like unto great serpents, he pierced the vital parts of his enemy overwhelming the Monkey General, but Nila, the leader of the monkey army, assailed by that hail of weapons, with one hand flung a great rock at the King of the Titans.", "Meanwhile Hanuman, burning with courage, having recovered his senses, in his martial ire cried out furiously:\u2014\u201cO Ravana, King of the Titans, who art engaged in combat with Nila, to attack one already fighting with another is unjust I\u201d", "The titan, however, shattered the crag, hurled by Nila, with seven pointed darts so that it fell in pieces and, seeing the rock riven asunder, the leader of the monkey army, Nila, destroyer of hostile forces, who resembled the Fire of Time, glowed with fury and began to hurl Asvakarna, Sala, Cuta and other flowering trees of varying fragrance in the fight, whereupon Ravana caught them in his arms and snapped them, showering a formidable rain of shafts, as from a cloud, on Pavaki but that colossus, assuming a diminutive form, leapt on to the point of Ravana\u2019s standard.", "Beholding the offspring of Pavaki thus installed on the point of his standard, the King blazed with fury, whilst Nila let forth a shout, and sometimes the monkey leapt on to the apex of the banner and sometimes on to the end of the bow and sometimes on to the peak of the diadem, so that Lakshmana, Hanuman and Rama also, were astonished.", "The intrepid titan too was amazed at the monkey\u2019s agility and took up a marvellous and flaming arrow but the Plavam-gamas shouted joyously at Nila\u2019s tactics, being amused to see Ravana disconcerted by his leaping about in combat and the shouts of the monkeys infuriated Dashagriva, who, in his confusion, did not know how to act.", "Taking up an arrow charged with sacred formulas, that prowler of the night aimed at Nila, who had climbed to the tip of his standard and, at that instant, the King of the Titans, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Monkey, thine agility proceeds from a rare power of magic; do you save thyself if you canst by these innumerable tricks with which you are familiar and constantly employest! This mantra-propelled weapon of mine, that I am about to loose, will sever the existence you seeks to retain!\u201d", "Speaking thus, the long-armed Ravana, Lord of the Titans, having placed Agni\u2019s shaft on his bow, struck Nila, the General of the monkey army, with that weapon and he, pierced through the breast by that shaft charged with sacred mantras, was suddenly overcome and fell to the earth, yet by virtue of his sire\u2019s powerful aid and his own native vigour, though brought to his knees he was not deprived of life.", "Beholding the monkey unconscious, Dashagriva, insatiable in combat, in his chariot, whose rattling resounded like thunderclouds, rushed on Lakshmana and coming to the centre of the field, halted, standing there in his glory.", "Thereafter the majestic Lord of the Titans lifted up his bow, whereupon Saumitri, of indomitable courage, said to him as he prepared to loose his powerful shaft:\u2014", "\u201cO King of the Night-rangers, now enter into combat with me; cease from fighting with the monkeys!\u201d", "Hearing that marvellously modulated voice that resounded like the twanging of a bow-string, the King, drawing near to his adversary, who stood close to his chariot, answered in anger:\u2014", "\u201cO Son of Raghu, it is my good fortune that brings you within my range to-day, you who, in your folly, advancest to meet your death! This very instant you shalt descend to the region of Mrityu under a rain of missiles loosed by me.\u201d", "Then Saumitri, unmoved, spoke to that boastful titan of sharp and protruding teeth, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO King, stout hearts eschew bragging! O Greatest of Evil Doers, you are sounding thine own praises! I am well acquainted with your strength, prowess, vigour and audacity, O King of the Titans! Approach! Here I stand with bow and arrows in my hand; of what use are vain boasts?\u201d", "Thus accosted, the Lord of the Titans, infuriated, let fly seven marvellously plumed arrows which Lakshmana shattered with his golden-shafted darts. Observing his shafts resembling great serpents, whose coils had been crushed in an instant, the Lord of Lanka was transported with anger and let fly further sharp arrows. The younger brother of Rama, however, caused a well-aimed rain of missiles from his bow to fall on Ravana, but he, with the aid of weapons in the forms of knives, crescents and long-eared arrowheads, severed them, without allowing them to disturb him.", "Seeing that the succession of his shafts proved useless, the King of those hostile to the Gods, astonished at Lakshmana\u2019s skill, let fly more whetted shafts upon him anew and, from his side, Lakshmana, the equal of Mahendra, placing some sharpened darts on his bow that were formidable,swift as lightning and of blazing effulgence, loosed them on the Titan King in order to strike him down, whereupon Ravana shattered those pointed darts and struck his rival in the forehead with a shaft as bright as the Fire of Time, which had been bestowed on him by Svyambhu. Then Lakshmana, struck by that missile, reded a little, scarcely able to retain his bow but coming to himself with difficulty, he shattered that weapon belonging to Indra\u2019s foe. Having broken his bow, the son of Dasaratha struck him with three pointed darts and the king, pierced by those arrows, swooned, regaining his senses with difficulty. Wounded by those shafts, his bow wholly demolished, his limbs spattered with flesh and streaming with blood, the Enemy of the Gods, himself of formidable energy, seized a spear which had been given him in war by Svyambhu. That smoking lance, as bright as fire, the terror of the monkeys in the fray, the powerful guardian of the titan empire, was hurled on Saumitri the younger brother of Bharata, who received that spear falling upon him with arrows and darts, as if it were a sacrificial fire; nevertheless that weapon entered his broad chest.", "The powerful Raghu, struck by that spear, lay on the earth, breathing fire and the King of the Titans rushing on him suddenly, while he was yet insensible, seized him brutally in his two hands, yet though he was able to lift up Himavat, Mandara, Meru and the Three Worlds with the Gods, he could not raise the younger brother of Bharata, for Lakshmana, though wounded in the breast by Brahma\u2019s weapon, recollected that he was of the substance of Vishnu Himself, and that thorn in the side of the Gods, though overcoming Saumitri, was unable to bear him away.", "At that instant, the son of Vayu, enraged, threw himself in anger on Ravana like a flash of lightning and struck him with his fist on the chest. Under that blow, the Lord of the Titans was brought to his knees and stumbling, fell. From his ten mouths, eyes and ears, blood streamed in torrents and, rolling unconscious, he slid under the body of the chariot; there he remained deprived of his senses, stupified, not knowing where he was. Beholding Ravana, despite his redoubtable strength swoon on the battlefield, Rishis and monkeys began to shout in triumph as did also the Gods and Asuras, whilst the courageous Hanuman lifting up Lakshmana in his arms, who had been wounded by his adversary, returned to Raghava. In his friendship and extreme devotion to him, the son of Vayu found Lakshmana, whom foes were unable to move, as light as a feather. Thereafter the spear, that had overcome Saumitri, returned to the titan\u2019s chariot.", "Meanwhile Ravana who was full of energy in combat, having recovered consciousness, selected some steel-pointed arrows and armed himself with an enormous bow.", "On his side, healed and freed from that lance, Lakshmana recollected that he was part of Vishnu, and Rama, seeing the innumerable army of powerful monkeys overthrown on the battlefield, rushed on Ravana, but Hanuman, following him, said:\u2014", "\u201cClimb on my shoulders in order to overcome the titan!\u201d", "Hearing those words from the son of Vayu, Raghava climbed on the shoulders of that great monkey, as Vishnu on Garuda, in order to fight with the Enemy of the Gods.", "Standing in his chariot, Ravana appeared before that Lord of Men and, seeing him, that mighty hero rushed upon him, like unto Vishnu with his mace upraised rushing furiously on Virocana. Thereupon Rama drew the cord of his bow and, like unto the roll of thunder, said in a deep voice to the Lord of the Titans:\u2014", "\u201cStay! Stay! You have evoked my displeasure! Where, O Tiger among the Titans, will you flee to escape me? Even if you seeks refuge in the region of Indra or Vaivasvata or Bhaskara or Svyambhu, Vaishnavara, Shankara or in the ten regions, even in those abodes you shalt not elude me from now on. The one who, struck by the spear, fell swooning this day only to recover consciousness immediately, shall now, assuming the form of death, claim you, your sons, and grandsons in battle. O King of the Titan People, here is he under whose blows, fourteen thousand titans of terrible form perished, who had established themselves in Janasthana and were furnished with excellent weapons.\u201d", "Hearing Raghava speak thus, the exceedingly powerful Lord of the Titans full of rage, hurled himself on the son of Vayu, who was bearing Rama with extreme velocity through the fray and, recollecting his former hostility, he smote him with flaming arrows resembling the tongues of the Fire of Dissolution. Struck by that titan as also pierced by his darts, the native strength of which Hanuman was possessed increased still further. Nevertheless the extremely illustrious Rama, seeing the wound that Ravana had just inflicted on that lion among the Plavagas, was transported with anger and, approaching his chariot with his slender and pointed shafts, shattered it with its wheels, horses, banner, canopy, great standard, charioteer, darts, spears and swords; thereafter, with great force, he hurled a weapon like unto a thunderbolt falling on Mount Meru so that that valiant monarch, whom neither thunder nor lightning could cause to tremble, stumbled, letting fall his bow at the violent impact of Rama\u2019s missile, which created a deep wound.", "Seeing him swooning, the magnanimous Rama took up a flaming arrow shaped like a crescent moon and used it to shatter the crown of the supreme Lord of the Titans, which was as bright as the sun.", "Then Rama said to that Indra of the Titans, whose splendour was dimmed, the setting of his diadem riven, and who resembled a venomous snake robbed of its poison, or the sun, its rays extinguished, bereft of lustre:\u2014", "\u201cYou have accomplished a great feat and my brave soldiers have succumbed beneath your blows; now you are weary; in this condition I shall not put you under Mrityu\u2019s power with my shafts. Leave the fray and return to Lanka; I grant you this reprieve, O King of the Rangers of the Night! Having regained your breath, return in your chariot with your bow and, standing on your car, you shaft once more bear testimony to my prowess!\u201d", "At these words, his joy and boasting subdued, his bow shattered, his horses and charioteer slain, pierced with arrows, his great diadem broken, the king instantly returned to Lanka.", "After the departure of that powerful Indra of Night Rangers, Lakshmana drew out the arrows from the monkeys, which they had received while fighting in the forefront of that vast battlefield, and the adversary of the King of the Gods being vanquished, all the Celestials, Asuras and creatures of the ocean and other regions with the great serpents, as also all beings on earth and in the waters, rejoiced.", "Returning to the City of Lanka, afflicted with the fear of Rama\u2019s arrows, his pride humbled, the king\u2019s mind was troubled. Like an elephant by a lion or a snake by Garuda, that monarch had been overcome by the great-souled Rama, and the Lord of the Titans was maddened by the mere recollection of Rama\u2019s shafts possessed of the splendour of lightning, resembling the Rod of Brahma.", "Seated on his magnificent and elevated throne made of gold, he let his gaze wander over the titans and said:\u2014", "\u201cSince I, the equal of the mighty Indra, have been defeated by a mere man, all the rigorous asceticism I have practised has been in vain. I asked to be rendered invulnerable to Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas and Pannagas, but of man I made no mention.", "Rama, the son of Dasaratha is the one, I deem, of whom Anaranya, born of the race of Ikshvaku spoke, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Lord of the Titans, in my House will be born a naan who will slay you in battle with your sons, ministers, army and charioteer, O Vilest of Your Race, O Perverse Wretch!\u2019", "\u201cI was further cursed by Vedavati for a former outrage and perchance she has been born as the high-souled daughter of Janaka and what was predicted by Uma, Nandishvara, Rambha and Punjikasthala, the daughter of Varuna, has come to pass! The words of the sages never prove false, it is on account of all this therefore that you should exert yourselves to the uttermost.", "\u201cLet the titans go to the summit of the Charyapura Mountain and awaken Kumbhakarna on whom the curse of Brahma rests, he who is without equal in prowess and who humbles the pride of the Gods and Danavas themselves.\u201d", "Prahasta being slain and the king himself defeated in the fight, that monarch issued his commands to the dreadful host, saying:\u2014", "\u201cGuard the gates and man the ramparts, rouse Kumbhakarna who is slumbering soundly. He is sleeping peacefully oblivious of all that is passing, his senses overcome by lust, and he remains unconscious for periods of two or three or nine days and sometimes for six, seven or eight months. Having met in consultation with me nine days ago, he has since fallen asleep. In combat, that warrior is the rampart of all the titans; he will soon strike down all the monkeys and those two sons of a king. He is the very banner of the titans in battle but that insensate one, intent on vulgar pleasures, still slumbers. Though overcome by Rama in this terrible struggle, my fears will be dissipated when Kumbhakarna wakes; of what use is this rival of Indra to me, if, in so pressing a danger, he is not ready to assist me?\u201d", "Hearing their sovereign\u2019s words, the titans ran in great haste to Kumbhakarna\u2019s abode. At Ravana\u2019s command, those eaters of flesh and drinkers of blood took perfumes, garlands and a great store of food and left immediately. They entered that cave with its gates measuring a league in extent, the wonderful refuge of Kumbhakarna, from which issued the fragrance of flowers. And with his breathing, Kumbhakarna pressed those titans back despite their strength who, with difficulty, had penetrated into the cave.", "When they had entered into that ravishing underground dwelling paved with precious stones and gold, those lions among the Nairritas beheld that redoubtable giant lying there, and that monster, wrapt in profound slumber, resembled a crumbling mountain and together they sought to waken him.", "His limbs covered with down which stood on end, Kumbhakarna, he of irresistible valour, was breathing like a serpent, and, as he slept, he emitted dreadful snores, his nostrils being horrible and his mouth a gaping hell. Stretched to his full length on the earth, he gave forth an odour of marrow and blood; his limbs were adorned with golden armlets and he wore a diadem as bright as the sun; thus did that lion among the Nairritas, Kumbhakarna, the slayer of his foes, appear!", "Then those powerful titans, in order to satisfy him, placed a heap of venison as high as Mount Meru before him and piled up a great mass of viands, antelope, buffalo and bear and a prodigious mound of victuals, leathern bottles of blood and meats of every kind before Kumbhakama, the Enemy of the Gods. Thereafter they rubbed that scourge of his foes with the most rare sandalwood and covered him with celestial garlands, and sweet smelling perfumes, and they burnt incense and hymned the praises of that warrior who proved fatal to his foes.", "The voices of the Yatudhanas burst forth on every side like thunder and with full cheeks they blew impatiently on their conches as bright as the moon, causing a terrible uproar, and those rangers of the night clapped their hands and shook Kumbhakama, creating a great clamour, in order to awaken him, so that the birds passing through the air fell down at the sound of the conches, drums, gongs, clapping of hands and leonine roars.", "As the illustrious Kumbhakama did not waken from his slumber despite the great uproar, all those troops of titans seized hold of bars, pestles, maces, rocks, clubs, hammers, and with these and blows from their fists, those titans beat the chest of Kumbhakama violently as he was sleeping peacefully on the ground. And Kumbhakama\u2019s breathing prevented those titans from standing upright so that they had to seat themselves round him and, with all their strength, which was considerable, they began to beat drums, cymbals and gongs and to blow their myriad conches and trampets. Ten thousand demons surrounded that colossus who resembled a heap of antimony, and tried in every way to rouse him by their blows and cries; nevertheless he did not wake.", "As they were unable to rouse him by these means, they had resort to more energetic and ruthless methods, causing horses, camels and elephants, whom they beat with sticks, whips and thongs, to trample upon him, while gongs, conches and trumpets blared forth as they crushed his limbs under piles of heavy logs. The noise of the hammers and pestles they wielded with all their strength and the shouts they raised filled the whole of Lanka with its hills and woods but still he did not wake.", "Then they beat a thousand drums simultaneously with sticks of refined gold but yet he did not stir from his profound slumber, being under the spell of the divine curse.", "Finally those powerful rangers of the night, growing enraged, redoubled their efforts in order to rouse the titan and some beat drums, some shouted, some tore out his hair and others bit his ears, pouring hundreds of pitchers of water into them, but Kumbhakarna, plunged in deep sleep, did not stir. Some armed with daggers struck that mighty titan on the head, chest and limbs but that monster did not wake, though smitten by Shataghnis fastened with ropes, and at last a thousand titans ran up and down his body, till Kumbhakarna, becoming aware of that pressure, he who had remained insensible to the violent blows of crags and trees, under the prompting of extreme hunger suddenly emerged from sleep, yawning, and with one bound, stood up. Waving his two arms resembling serpent\u2019s coils or the peaks of mountains, hard as cut diamonds, that ranger of the night opened his monstrous mouth, like unto Vadavamukha and yawned horribly, and when he yawned, his mouth resembled hell and glittered like the sun rising over the high peak of Mt. Meru.", "That extremely powerful ranger of the night, being awake, yawned, heaving a sigh like unto a tempest that shatters a mountain; and Kumbhakarna, rising up, resembling Time at the dissolution of the world, prepared to devour all beings and his two great eyes, like glowing braziers, glittering like lightning, resembled two huge flaming planets.", "Then they pointed to those victuals of every kind, boar and buffalo and the giant devoured them. Thereafter that enemy of Shakra\u2019s satisfied his hunger with flesh and his thirst with blood, and he swallowed pitchers full of fat and wine, whereupon he, having feasted, those rangers of the night approached him and, surrounding him, paid obeisance to him.", "Raising his eyelids that were heavy with sleep, his gaze still veiled, he let his glance fall on the night rangers on every side and, in a voice of authority, that lion among the Nairritas, surprised at being roused, enquired of them, saying", "\u201cFor what reason have you thus wakened me so suddenly? Is all well with the king or is he in some peril? In truth there must be some pressing and serious danger from an external source since you have come in haste to awaken me. I shall drive every misfortune away from the King of the Titans this very day even if I have to cut Mahendra himself to pieces or freeze Anala! Nay, it is certain that one does not interrupt the slumbers of one, such as I, for any trivial motive. Tell me frankly for what reason you have roused me, Kumbhakarna, the vanquisher of my foes?\u201d", "At these words, that were tinged with wrath, Yupaksha, the king\u2019s confidential minister, with joined palms, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt is not the Gods who threaten us in any way but a man who has placed us in this evil case, O Prince! It is not the Devas or Danavas who have put us in this peril; it comes to us from a mortal. Monkeys as large as hills are besieging Lanka! Furious on account of Sita\u2019s abduction, Rama is pressing us heavily. Recently a single monkey set fire to our great city and slew the youthful Prince Aksha with his escort of elephants. \u2018Get you hence!\u2019 were the words addressed by Rama to the King of the Titans in person, the offspring of Paulastya, that thorn in the side of the Gods, he who is equal to Aditya in splendour. That which this monarch never suffered at the hands of the Gods or Daityas or Danavas, he has had to endure from Rama, who spared his life.\u201d", "Hearing from Yupaksha that his brother had been defeated in combat, Kumbhakarna, rolling his great eyes, said:\u2014", "\u201cThis very day, O Yupaksha, the whole army of monkeys with Lakshmana and Raghava will be destroyed by me on the field of battle after I have presented myself before Ravana. I shall gorge the titans on the blood of monkeys and, as for Rama and Lakshmana, I shall drink their blood myself I\u201d", "Hearing these bold words from that titan, whose anger increased his ferocity, Mahodara, the Leader of the Nairrita warriors, having offered him obeisance with joined palms, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cWhen you have listened to Ravana and weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the matter, then, O Long-armed Warrior, set out immediately and destroy the foe on the battlefield.\u201d", "Thus spoke Mahodara and Kumbhakarna, surrounded by titans, full of energy and prowess, prepared to depart. Thereupon the titans, having succeeded in rousing that prince of dreadful aspect and formidable valour, returned to the king\u2019s palace in all haste. Approaching Dashagriva who was seated on the throne, all those night-rangers with joined palms said to him:\u2014", "\u201cYour brother, Kumbhakarna, has wakened, O King of the Titans, and now is it your will that he should enter the battlefield or dost you desire him to come hither?\u201d", "Thereupon Ravana answered those titans who stood before him and, with a glad heart, said:\u2014", "\u201cI desire to see him here; let him receive the honours due to his rank!\u201d", "\u201cBe it so!\u201d answered all the titans and they returned to Kumbhakarna in order to apprise him of Ravana\u2019s command and said:\u2014", "\u201cDo you go to the king, that lion of all the titans desires to see you; go and gratify your brother!\u201d", "Then Kumbhakarna, that indomitable and mighty warrior, hearing what was his brother\u2019s wish, cried:\u2014\u201cSo be it!\u201d and leapt up from his couch. Washing his face and bathing, refreshed and delighted, he desired them to bring him to drink with speed, whereupon they brought him a soothing draught and those titans hastened to carry out Ravana\u2019s commands and presented him with wines and meats of every kind.", "Having swallowed two thousand full pitchers, Kumbhakarna prepared to set out and, slightly inebriated and flushed, he was exhilarated and filled with energy. Impatiently, he marched away like Yama at the end of the World period, and approaching his brother\u2019s palace, he caused the earth to tremble with his tread. His body illumined the royal highway, like unto that orb of a thousand rays which gives light to the earth and, as he advanced, surrounded by a circle of titans paying him obeisance, he resembled Shatakratu approaching Svyambhu\u2019s abode.", "Seeing that slayer of his foes on the royal highway, that monster as high as the peak of a mountain, the inhabitants of the woods, stationed outside (the city) as also their leaders, were seized with a sudden panic.", "Some rushed to Rama for refuge, others fled away in fear, some, terrified, stampeded in all directions, others, paralysed with fright, lay on the ground.", "Beholding that giant like a great peak, adorned with a diadem, who seemed to quench the sun with his brilliance, the inhabitants of the woods were seized with terror and, at the sight of that prodigy, fled in all directions.", "Meanwhile the illustrious and valiant Rama, bow in hand, beheld that giant Kumbhakama adorned with a diadem and, seeing that Indra among Titans with golden armlets, who resembled a mountain and was like unto a cloud charged with rain, or Narayana when formerly taking the three strides, the monkeys scattered once more.", "In view of the stampede of his forces and that titan, who appeared to be increasing in size, Rama, astonished, enquired of Bibishana:\u2014", "\u201cWho is this hero with a diadem and yellow eyes, resembling a mountain, who is to be seen in Lanka like unto a cloud riven by lightning or a great and strange meteor which has fallen to earth; he, at whose sight, the monkeys flee away on all sides? Tell me, who is this colossus? Is it a Rakshasa or an Asura? Never have I seen such a being!\u201d", "Thus questioned by Prince Rama of imperishable exploits, Bibishana, in his great wisdom, answered:\u2014", "\u201cIt is he by whom Vaivasvata and Vasava were defeated in battle; it is the illustrious Kumbhakama, the son of Vaishravas! There is no titan equal to him in stature, he routed the Devas, Danavas, Yakshas, Bhujamgas, Pishitashanas, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas and Pannagas in their thousands, O Raghava! The Gods themselves are not able to slay Kumbhakama, who, spear in hand, is of monstrous aspect. \u2018It is the God of Death himself\u2019 they cry.", "\u201cThe mighty Kumbhakarna is innately powerful, whilst the foremost of the titans owe their strength to the boons they have received. As soon as that monster was born and while yet an infant, urged on by hunger, he devoured thousands of beings. Seeing their kind consumed, those creatures, mad with fear, took refuge with Shakra and told him all that had taken place. Enraged, Mahendra struck Kumbhakarna with his mighty thunderbolt and, at the impact of Indra\u2019s weapon, that giant reeled howling with terror.", "\u201cWhen the cries of the titan were heard, the fear of those beings increased, and in his anger, the mighty Kumbhakarna tore out one of Airavata\u2019s tusks in order to pierce Vasava\u2019s breast and, under the blows of that monster, Indra appeared like a flame. Seeing this, the Devas, Brahmarishis and Danavas were thunderstruck and Shakra with those Celestials went to Svyambhu\u2019s abode and informed Prajapati of Kumbhakarna\u2019s wickedness; he also described to the inhabitants of the heavenly region, how he had devoured all those creatures, laid waste the hermitages and carried off others wives and said \u2018If he continues to devour those beings, in a short time the whole world will become a desert\u2019.", "\u201cHearing Vasava\u2019s words, the Grandsire of the Worlds summoned that titan, who appeared before him.", "On beholding Kumbhakarna, Prajapati was troubled but, recovering himself, said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Assuredly Paulastya begot you to the destruction of the worlds! From to-day you shalt sleep like the dead!\u2019", "Struck by the Lord\u2019s curse that titan fell down before him.", "\u201cMeanwhile Ravana, exceedingly perturbed, said to Brahma:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018You have hewn down the golden tree which was about to bear fruit! It does not behove you to curse thine own grandson, O Prajapati; nevertheless your words may never prove vain; assuredly he must slumber but at least appoint a time for sleeping and a time for waking!\u2019", "\u201cOn Ravana\u2019s request, Svyambhu answered:\u2014", "\u2018He shall sleep for six months and wake for a single day; for one day that warrior shall range the earth in order to appease his hunger, otherwise with his huge mouth he will consume the worlds like a great fire.\u2019", "\u201cIt is in fear of your prowess that the King Ravana, beset with peril, has now awakened Kumbhakarna, and that warrior of exceeding valour has emerged from his retreat transported with anger and is rushing upon the monkeys in order to devour them and appease his hunger. Seeing Kumbhakarna they have taken to flight; how can those monkeys withstand him in combat? Let them be told that he is merely a mechanical device created to frighten them; at these tidings they will take heart and remain here.\u201d", "Hearing Bibishana\u2019s eloquent and persuasive speech, Raghava said to the General Nila:\u2014", "\u201cGo, rally your forces and, having occupied the outposts of Lanka, the highways and bridges, let them strike camp, O Pavaki! See that the monkeys, furnished with rocks, trees and stones, arm themselves with these weapons.\u201d", "At Rama\u2019s command, Nila, the leader in chief, a prince of monkeys, issued his orders to the army and thereafter armed with boulders, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Hanuman and Angada, like unto hills, advanced to the gates.", "Having listened to Rama, the monkeys, those valiant apes, fell upon the enemy\u2019s army with shouts of triumph, battering it with trees and that ferocious company of monkeys, brandishing crags and trees, appeared as resplendent as a lowering mass of clouds spreading over a mountain.", "Meanwhile that Lion among the Titans, resplendent in glory, still heavy with sleep, advanced with great strides along the royal highway; titans in their thousands surrounded that most invincible of warriors and, from the houses, a rain of flowers fell upon him as he passed.", "Thereafter he beheld the vast and enchanting residence covered with gold of that Indra of the Titans which shone like the sun, resembling that orb when it enters a mass of clouds, and he penetrated into the palace belonging to the King of the Titans, observing him from afar on his throne, like unto Shakra approaching Svyambhu seated in state.", "Coming to Ravana\u2019s abode with his escort of titans, Kumbhakama, pacing the earth, caused it to tremble. Having crossed the threshold of the palace, he passed through the courtyard and perceived his elder brother, who appeared troubled, seated in the Chariot Pushpaka. Full of anxiety, Dashagriva, beholding Kumbhakama, immediately rose up joyfully and motioned him to approach.", "Then that mighty warrior, bowing to the feet of his brother, who was reclining on a couch, enquired of him:\u2014\u201cWhat dost you desire of me?\u201d", "With renewed delight, Ravana rose and embraced him whereupon with brotherly salutations and traditional courtesies, Kumbhakama ascended the celestial and shining throne, and that giant being seated, his eyes red with anger, enquired of Ravana:\u2014", "\u201cWhy hast you forcibly torn me from my slumber, O King? Say from whence springs your fear and whom dost you wish me to slay this day?\u201d", "Then Ravana answered the enraged Kumbhakama seated beside him, who was rolling his inflamed eyes, and said:\u2014", "\u201cYou have slumbered for some time, O Warrior, and, in your profound oblivion, were indifferent to the peril in which Rama has plunged me. This glorious and mighty son of Dasaratha accompanied by Sugriva, having crossed the sea without hindrance, is destroying our race. Alas! See how by means of a bridge, these monkeys have made an ocean of the woods and groves of Lanka 1", "\u201cThe foremost of the titans have been slain by them in combat, nor do I see how these monkeys can be destroyed in battle by any means. Save us from this great peril, O Mighty Hero, and exterminate them to-day I It is on this account that you have been awakened; all my resources are exhausted I Help me to save the City of Lanka, in which the children and the aged alone remain. O Long-armed Warrior, for your brother\u2019s sake, accomplish this feat, impossible to another. I have never before spoken thus to any of my brothers, O Scourge of Your Foes! I have placed my supreme hopes and affections on you! O Bull among the Titans, how often, in the wars between Devas and Asuras, hast you overcome the Gods and Celestial Beings ranged against you! Call upon your valour, assuredly among all creatures none is equal to you in strength, O Redoubtable Hero! Render me this great service, O You, the lover of combat; do this for me, O You who art devoted to your friends 1 By your personal prowess scatter these hostile forces as the wind scatters the autumnal clouds.\u201d", "Hearing the lament of the King of the Titans, Kumbhakarna said with a mocking laugh:\u2014", "\u201cAs an evil doer falls into hell as a result of his misdeeds, a swift retribution has followed on the error of judgment we saw you commit formerly in council through lack of trust in your ministers! Firstly, O Great King, you didst not reflect on what might happen and, in the pride of thine own strength, overlooked the consequences. He, who trusting in his own power, leaves until last that which should be done first or who does first, that which should follow, is unable to distinguish between what is wise and what is foolish. As offerings poured into an unsanctified fire so are those actions disastrous which are performed without regard to time and place or in opposition to them. He goes straight to the goal, who, in consultation with his ministers, has examined the three kinds of action and their five aspects. A king who makes his decisions according to the traditional laws, and allows himself to be advised by his counsellors and consults his friends, pursuing duty, profit and pleasure at the proper season or following two of them or all of them combined, is a wise monarch and has a sound understanding, O Lord of the Titans.", "\u201cBut the sovereign or heir-apparent, who, having heard what is best for the cultivation of these three means and yet does not comprehend them, has spent his time listening to instruction in vain. The king who consults his ministers regarding the bestowal of gifts, conciliation, sowing dissension, taking action or uniting himself with the foe as also the consideration of what should or should not be done and the questions of duty, profit and pursuit of pleasure, dealing with them in conformity with circumstances, and is master of himself, is not visited by misfortune!", "\u201cHe verily is a king, who, with experienced and sagacious counsellors, having studied the advantages he desires to reap from an undertaking and the wisdom of entering into it, takes action.", "\u201cOne should never follow the advice of those admitted to council who are not conversant with the meaning of the scriptures, whose intelligence is equal to the beasts and who, in their conceit, prate continuously! Neither should one follow the advice of those who, in their ignorance of the tradition and the works of political science, merely seek to amass wealth. And those counsellors who, in their complacency, hold specious but sinister debates, should be excluded from any deliberation, for they mar every transaction. Those in the pay of well-informed enemies, who, in order to betray their master, advise him to act contrary to his interests, will be recognized by the king when they are in the assembly, and a monarch will soon discover those who, under the mask of devotion hide their treachery, by studying their conduct in their deliberations when they are met together. Those foolish ones, who rush precipitately into action like birds entering a hole in the Krauncha Mountain, are overwhelmed by the enemy and he who, disregarding the foe, fails to protect himself, experiences nothing but reverses and loses his status.", "\u201cThe advice that the beloved Mandodari and my younger brother, Bibishana, formerly gave you, I now repeat for thine own good; do what you considerest best!\u201d", "Hearing Kumbhakama\u2019s words, Dashagriva frowned and replied angrily:\u2014", "\u201cOne should pay the same respect to one\u2019s elder brother as to one\u2019s spiritual preceptor! Of what interest to me are your counsels? Why fatigue thyself? Consider what is fitting at the moment; whatever has impeded success, whether it has been folly or too great a confidence in the strength of mine army, it is useless to discuss it now 1 Advise me as to what should be done in the present circumstances. Let your valour remedy the evil that mine imprudence has brought about if you are truly devoted to me and hast confidence in thine own prowess and if thine heart is in this great struggle and you considerest it to be of supreme moment. He is a friend who rescues one in distress; a kinsman he, who helps one who has failed.\u201d", "Thus spoke Ravana in imperious and harsh accents and Kumbhakarna reflecting within himself \u2018he is enraged\u2019, answered him mildly in soothing tones, Looking fixedly at his brother, whose mind was agitated, he spoke comforting words to him in a quiet voice, saying:\u2014", "\u201cListen carefully, O King, O Scourge of Your Foes, O Leader of the Titan Princes, banish your grief, renounce thine anger and be thyself again! There is no reason for thine heart to be troubled as long as I five, O Lord! I will slay him who is the cause of your distress but, in any circumstances, I had, of necessity, to speak for thine own good because of kinship and brotherly affection for you, O Monarch.", "\u201cIt is on account of this that I will show myself to be a friend and a brother and, in combat, annihilate the enemy under thine eyes. To-day, O Long-armed Warrior, you shalt see me in the forefront of battle, having slain Rama and his brother and put the monkey army to flight. Seeing me bring back Rama\u2019s head from the battlefield this day, you will be happy, O Warrior, and Sita overwhelmed with despair.", "\u201cT o-day all the titans of Lanka, whose kinsfolk have perished, will witness the death of Rama who is the object of men\u2019s desires! By striking down the foe in battle, I shall dry the tears of those who are overcome with sorrow and have been rendered desolate by the loss of their relatives. To-day you shalt see Sugriva, the leader of the Plavagas, who resembles a mountain illumined by the sun, lying on the earth. The titans, and I also, are eager to slay Dasaratha\u2019s son; this should fill you with confidence, how is it that you are still trembling, O Irreproachable Hero? Should he slay me, Raghava will assuredly slay you also but I have nothing to fear, O Lord of the Titans! Now command me, O Scourge of Your Foes, do not seek another for this encounter, O Incomparable Hero! I shall destroy your foes despite their strength! Even were it Shakra or Yama or Pavaka or Maruta, I should enter into combat with them or with Kuvera or Varuna themselves; I, who in stature am like unto a mountain, with a sharpened spear as my weapon, my war-cry, my pointed teeth, at the sight of which Purandara himself trembles, throwing away my arms, shall strike down the foe with blows of my fists. None will be able to withstand me, no matter how much they may cling to life, nor have I need of lance, mace, sword or whetted dart; with my bare hands alone, I will kill Raghava, were he accompanied by the God who bears the Thunderbolt himself! If he is able to withstand the force of my fists then mine arrows will drink his life\u2019s blood! O King, I stand here, why art you overwhelmed with despair? Here I wait ready to exterminate the slayers of titans, by whom Lanka has been set on fire, and also the monkeys, in the struggle that is about to take place. I shall confer a rare and great glory upon you! Did the danger come from Indra or Svyambhu or the Gods themselves, I should make them measure their length on the field of battle, O King! I shall overcome Yama, consume Pavaka, hurl down Varuna, pulverize the mountains and shatter the earth! After my long sleep, let those beings I am about to consume, witness the prowess of Kumbhakarna this day! Nay, the Three Worlds shall not be able to glut mine appetite! In order to please you I will slay the son of Dasaratha! Having struck down Rama and Lakshmana, I shall devour all the foremost of the monkey leaders. Rejoice therefore, O King and drink wine, do what you have to do and banish grief; to-day I shall send Rama to the abode of death and Sita will become thine for ever!\u201d", "Hearing this speech of the colossal and valiant Kumbhakarna, Mahodara replied:\u2014", "\u201cKumbhakarna, you are an offshoot of an illustrious race, you are courageous but you have two vulgar characteristics and, in your conceit, art unable to anticipate the course of events in all its aspects.", "\u201cIt is not true that the king does not understand what is politic and impolitic, O Kumbhakarna, but you, in your youthful impetuosity, knowest only how to prate! The Lord of the Titans, who is conversant with the laws of time and place, is also aware of increase and loss as well as our situation and the state of the enemy.", "\u201cWhat man of sense would attempt that which an old thickheaded soldier with no respect even for his elders plumes himself on accomplishing? When you dost assert that duty, profit and pleasure are essentially opposed to each other, it is a proof that you are unaware of their real nature. Action is undoubtedly the source of all experiences and here below, happiness is the fruit we seek even in our most evil acts. Apart from pleasure, duty and profit yield felicity, but the fruit reaped from injustice and unrighteousness is calamitous. Men of strong character undertake those acts, the consequences of which they reap in another world, whilst those who give themselves up to the pursuit of pleasure reap the consequences here.", "\u201cWhy should that which the king has so much at heart and which we approve, namely the chastising of his enemies, be set aside in any way? As for the motives you have given for marching against Rama single-handed, I will point out to you what is ill-considered and reprehensible about them! How canst you defeat Rama alone, he who formerly destroyed innumerable exceedingly powerfill titans in Janasthana? Those rangers of the night whom he overcame in Janasthana were valiant warriors also and dost you not behold them in the city, stricken with fear? By rousing Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who resembles a wounded lion, alas you are waking a sleeping serpent! Burning with valour and unapproachable in his fury, inaccessible as Mrityu, who would dare to challenge him? This entire army cannot face that foe without being imperilled, therefore it in no wise recommends itself to me that you should go out to meet him alone, O Child. Who, bereft of resources would be eager to meet with an adversary, ready to sacrifice his life and furnished with every pre-requisite! Rama has no equal among men, O Best of the Titans, how canst you plume thyself on entering into combat with him who is the rival of Indra and Vaivasvata?\u201d", "Having spoken thus to the enraged Kumbhakarna, Mahodara said to Ravana, the Destroyer of the Worlds, who was surrounded by the titans:\u2014", "\u201cHaving formerly borne Vaidehi away, why dost you delay? If you desirest Sita to submit to your will, I see a means of bringing her to your feet. If it pleases you, O Indra among the Titans, then hear me!", "\u201cLet it be proclaimed that I, Dvijihva, Samhradin, Kumbhakarna and Vitadama, all five, are going forth to slay Rama! We shall engage him in a fierce struggle and, if we triumph over thine enemy, we need resort to no other means, but, if your rival survive and we escape from the fight, then we will adopt the measures I have planned.", "\u201cWe shall return from the battlefield and come hither covered with blood, our limbs pierced by darts on which are engraved Rama\u2019s name, and relate how we have destroyed Raghava and Lakshmana! Thereafter we shall press your feet and you will cover us with honour, after which, mounted on an elephant you will publish the tidings throughout the city, relating how Rama, his brother and his army were entirely destroyed. Simulating an extreme satisfaction, O Subduer of Your Foes, you will promote feasting and rejoicing and bestow gold and slaves on your servants and distribute garlands, raiment and perfumes on your warriors, you thyself manifesting your delight by drinking. Thereupon a rumour will spread everywhere that Rama and his friends have been devoured by the titans; such will be the report!", "\u201cThen shalt you repair secretly to where Sita is, in order to offer her consolation and tempt her with grain, diamonds and entertainment in order to seduce her. By this deceit, O King, Sita\u2019s grief will be increased and she, bereft of felicity, without a protector, will accede to your desire. Learning that her charming lord is slain, Sita, in despair and on account of womanly frailty, will submit to your will!", "\u201cBrought up in the lap of prosperity, this woman who is worthy of felicity and who is afflicted with misfortune, realising her happiness depends on you, will surrender herself wholly to you.", "\u201cThis is the best course for you to follow. Even to behold Rama may prove disastrous; have no anxiety! Great happiness awaits you here without entering into combat! Neither losing your forces nor courting danger, triumph over thine enemy, O Monarch! Glory, felicity, prosperity and renown will long be the lot of your sovereign majesty!\u201d", "Replying to Mahodara\u2019s reproaches, Kumbhakama said to his brother, Ravana, the King of the Titans:\u2014", "\u201cForsooth I shall dispel the immediate peril this day by slaying that wretch, Rama! Freed from thine adversary, be happy I Heroes do not thunder in vain like clouds bereft of rain! Do you mark how my threats find fulfilment in mine exploitsI Warriors do not need to boast, and accomplish the most difficult of feats without bluster! Cowardly monarchs, devoid of intelligence, who plume themselves on being wise, will ever find your speech acceptable, O Mahodara!", "\u201cAll you effeminate creatures, agreeable talkers, who flatter the king, have always ruined any martial enterprise. Nothing is left in Lanka save its sovereign; its wealth is exhausted, its army destroyed and that monarch is beset by foes in the guise of friends! I shall go out and fight, determined to triumph over the foe and, in this wise, redeem your calamitous policy in this great struggle.\u201d", "Hearing these words of the intelligent Kumbharkama, the King of the Titans answered laughing:\u2014", "\u201cIn sooth, Rama has terrorized Mahodara! Assuredly he does not relish battle, O Dear Friend! O Sagacious Warrior, I have none equal to you in devotion and prowess; go, slay mine adversary, O Kumbhakarna and speed towards victory!", "\u201cYou wast sleeping and it was for mine enemy\u2019s destruction that I had you wakened; this hour is of extreme significance to the titans, O Vanquisher of your Foes! Go, arm thyself; let those two princes, the equals of Aditya in splendour, be your pasture! Beholding you, the monkeys will take to flight and the hearts of Rama and Lakshmana will cease to beat.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to the exceedingly powerful Kumbhakarna, that illustrious lion of the titans felt he had received new life. Aware of Kumbhakarna\u2019s prowess and knowing his valour, the king expanded with joy like unto the immaculate moon.", "Hearing his words, which filled him with delight, that warrior went away and, having listened to the king\u2019s speech, prepared for battle. Then that scourge of his foes vigorously brandished his iron spear decorated with fine gold that shone brightly and was as renowned as Indra\u2019s thunderbolt and equally heavy. The scourge of the Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas and Pannagas, wreathed in garlands, festooned with crimson flowers, emitting flames, that great spear, stained with the blood of his enemies, was taken up by the illustrious Kumbhakarna, who addressed Ravana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI shall set out alone; let your powerful army remain here! To-day in mine hunger and fury, I shall devour the monkeys!\u201d", "At these words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana answered:\u2014", "\u201cDo you go out accompanied by troops furnished with picks and hammers; those monkeys are brave and exceedingly energetic! He who is rash enough to meet them alone will be torn to pieces by their teeth, yet, though they are extremely difficult to overcome, surround thyself with warriors and setting out, utterly destroy that enemy host so fatal to the titans!\u201d", "Thereafter, descending from the throne, the mighty Ravana placed a diadem, the interior of which was encrusted with pearls, on Kumbhakama\u2019s brow and decked out that hero with bracelets, rings, precious gems and a necklace as bright as the moon, covering his limbs with celestial and fragrant garlands and setting earrings in his ears. With the bracelets, anklets and golden coins, with which he was adorned, the large-eyed Kumbhakarna shone like the sacrificial fire.", "Resplendent with his great dark-blue girdle, he resembled the Mandara Mountain encircled by the snake at the time of the churning of the water of immortality. Clad in golden armour that no arrow could penetrate, which in its natural brilliance seemed to project flames, he was rendered as radiant as the King of the Mountains encircled by evening clouds. His entire body was covered with ornaments of every kind and, spear in hand, that titan called to mind Narayana, when, in his might, he took the three strides.", "Thereafter that warrior embraced his brother and paid obeisance to him by circumambulating him in the traditional manner and, inclining his head to him, set out to the sound of conches and gongs.", "Then Ravana, dismissing him with good wishes, caused an escort of well-equipped soldiers to accompany him with elephants, horses and chariots, emitting a sound like thunderclouds. Valiant fighters accompanied that prince of warriors mounted on serpents, buffalo, donkeys, lions, elephants antelopes and birds.", "It was under a prodigious shower of blossom, a parasol over him, bearing a pointed spear in his hand, full of daring, that the enemy of Devas and Danavas, intoxicated with the smell of blood, set forth. And innumerable titans followed him on foot, full of energy and prowess, fierce of aspect, bearing weapons in their hands, their eyes red; and their ranks measured many leagues in extent and they resembled heaps of antimony and brandished maces, swords, sharp axes, javelins, bars, ramrods, hammers, great Sala Trees and were furnished with nets.", "Meanwhile Kumbhakarna, assuming another terrible and ferocious form, advanced impetuously, measuring a hundred bows in breadth and six hundred in height, formidable, full of power and energy with eyes like unto chariot wheels. And, having assembled the titans, that colossus with his large mouth, who looked like a flaming crag said with a mocking laugh:\u2014", "\u201cTo-day the foremost of the monkey divisions will be consumed by me in my wrath one after the other like moths in a flame. Yet those inhabitants of the woods have never given offence and their race adorns the gardens of our dwellings.", "\u201cThe cause of the city being beseiged is Raghava, and Lakshmana who accompanies him; he being slain, all will be slain; I shall therefore destroy him in fight.\u201d", "At these words of Kumbhakama, the titans emitted a great shout that seemed to agitate the ocean.", "Then the crafty Kumbhakama went forth and sinister portents appeared on every side; dark and fearful clouds accompanied by meteors were seen, and the earth, the sea and the forests trembled. Jackals of ferocious aspect, with flames darting from their mouths, began to howl and birds wheeled from left to right. A vulture alighted on the titan\u2019s spear as he advanced, and his left eye and arm twitched; a flaming meteor fell with a terrible crash; the sun lost its brilliance and no favourable wind blew.", "Without heeding these threatening portents, causing the hair to stand on end, Kumbhakama set out, urged on by the force of destiny. Having crossed the ramparts, that giant, equal to a mountain, beheld the vast army of the monkeys resembling a cloud and, seeing that most powerful of the titans, as high as a mountain, those monkeys fled in all directions, like clouds driven before the wind. At the sight of that tremendous host of monkeys scattering to the four quarters like a mass of cloud melting away, Kumbhakama joyfully redoubled his shouts resembling thunder.", "Hearing those terrible shouts, like unto the roar of clouds in the sky, countless Plavagas fell to the earth like great Sala Trees whose roots have been severed and, as Kumbhakama hurled himself on the enemy with his huge mace in order to destroy him, he filled the ranks of the monkeys with extreme fear as does the Lord of Death accompanied by his minions at the end of the World Period.", "Having leapt over the wall, Kumbhakarna, that giant, like unto the peak of a mountain, full of valour, set out from the city in haste and emitted a great shout which agitated the waters, drowned the thunder claps and appeared to shatter the mountains.", "Seeing that warrior of fierce glance, as invincible as Maghavat, Yama or Varuna, the monkeys stampeded, and Prince Angada, beholding them fleeing, addressed the mighty Nala, Nila, Gavaksha and Kumuda, saying:\u2014", "\u201cForgetting your native valour and noble lineage, where are you fleeing in terror like common monkeys? Come back, O Companions, return! Is it thus that you defend your lives? Nay, this titan is not able to fight against you all; he is here to create panic amongst you. This great fear, that the titan inspires in you, will be dispelled by our prowess; return, O Plavamgamas!\u201d", "Rallied with difficulty from here and there and re-assured, those monkeys, armed with trees, halted in the field, and those dwellers in the woods stayed there ready to advance in fury on Kumbhakarna, like elephants intoxicated with Mada juice. Thereafter they attacked him valiantly with blows from mountain peaks, rocks and trees with their flowering crests but were unable to overthrow him. Innumerable stones, and trees with blossoming tops fell shattered on the earth, having come in contact with his limbs and that hero, enraged, on his side, struck down the ranks of those energetic monkeys by exercising his great strength, like unto a fire which suddenly blazes forth in the forest. Their limbs be-spattered with blood, those lions among the monkeys, overcome and cut down, lay there in great numbers resembling trees with coppery flowers. Thereafter, those monkeys bounded away without looking in which direction and some threw themselves into the sea and some leapt into the air. Overcome by that titan, who was disporting himself, some, despite their valour, fled over the sea by the way by which they had come and some, pale and distraught, escaped to the valleys. The bears climbed into the trees and some took refuge in the mountains; others being no longer able to stand, fell down and remained lying on the earth insensible as if asleep or dead.", "Seeing the monkeys routed, Angada called out to them:\u2014\u201cStay! Let us fight! Return, O Plavamgamas! Were you to range the whole earth in your flight I see no refuge for you anywhere! Why do you seek to preserve your lives? If you fly, leaving your weapons, lest they impede your course, your wives will deride you for this cowardice, which is death to men of honour, O Warriors! Whither are you fleeing filled with fear like common monkeys, you who are born in rich and illustrious families? Where are those deeds of valour and prowess of which you boasted in the assembly? The reproach of cowardice will be heard by you; he, who seeks to save his life by fleeing, is despised! Follow the path chosen by men of courage and overcome your fears. If, after a brief existence, you lie stretched on the earth dead, you will attain Brahmaloka, inaccessible to cowards. We shall acquire glory by striking down the foe in fight and, if we succumb, we shall enjoy the treasures of heaven in the region of heroes, O Monkeys! Nay, Kumbhakarna will never return alive, having come before Kakutstha, as a moth that draws near to a glowing brazier. If one, despite our numbers, is able to disperse us and we preserve our lives by fleeing, then there is an end to our renown!\u201d", "Such was Angada\u2019s speech, he of the golden bracelets, and the fugitives replied to that hero\u2019s reproaches, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThat Titan Kumbhakarna, has caused a terrible carnage amongst us; it is not the moment to stay; life is dear to us!\u201d", "With these words the leaders of the monkeys, beholding that giant of fearful glance advancing, scattered in all directions.", "Nevertheless Angada, by his exhortations and arguments, succeeded in rallying them and, re-assured by that sagacious son of Bali, they submitted to his commands and those foremost of monkeys returned to the field.", "[Full title: Kumbhakamd\u2019s Exploits; He is slain by Rama].", "Retracing their steps on hearing the voice of Angada, all those huge-bodied monkeys, resolutely taking their stand, desired nothing more than to join issue in the fight.", "Their confidence restored by the words of the valiant Angada, those monkeys, feeling their energy revived and their courage mounting, advanced, resolving to die and sacrifice their fives. Then those giants, arming themselves with trees and enormous crags, which they spun with great rapidity, hurled themselves on Kumbhakarna, whereupon, full of ire and vigour, that warrior of immense stature, brandishing his mace, dispersed the enemy on every side. Seven hundred and eight thousand monkeys lay scattered on the earth struck down by Kumbhakarna and, like unto Garuda consuming serpents, he seized hold of seven, eight, ten, twenty and thirty in his arms, crushing and devouring them in his extreme fury as he ran.", "Re-assured with exceeding difficulty, those monkeys rallied here and there and, armed with trees and rocks, took up their stand in the forefront of the battle. At that instant, Dvivida, that lion among monkeys, resembling a threatening cloud, tearing up a rock, hurled himself on the enemy who was like unto a mountain peak; and that monkey, breaking off the crag, flung it at Kumbhakarna, missing him, so that the missile fell on the titan force, crushing horses, elephants and chariots harnessed to excellent steeds. Another rock created further victims and, under that avalanche of stones, the titans wounded, their horses slain, their charioteers struck down, streaming with blood and mounted in theii cars, suddenly let forth terrible cries and with the aid of death-dealing arrows, severed the heads of those foremost of monkeys who were roaring.", "On their side, the monkeys, full of valour, uprooted great trees in order to crush the chariots, horses, elephants, buffalo and titans and, from the air where he was stationed, Hanuman showered rocks, stones and trees of every kind on the head of Kumbhakarna but that mighty one split and evaded that rain of trees. And he hurled himself upon that great army of monkeys brandishing his sharp pick and, as he rushed forward Hanuman placed himself in the way armed with the peak of a mountain, and, in fury struck Kumbhakama a violent blow, who, in his appalling corpulence, appeared like a hill! Then he whose limbs were dripping with fat and streaming with blood, stumbled under the shock and the titan hurled his spear, which was as bright as lightning and like a mountain spouting forth flames, striking Maruti between the arms, as Guha formerly struck the Krauncha Mountain with his formidable lance. His breast pierced by that spear, beside himself, vomiting blood, Hanuman, in fury, let forth a terrible cry in the midst of the battle, like the roar of a thundercloud at the end of the World Period, and a great cheer arose from the ranks of the titans as they beheld his plight, whilst the monkeys, distraught and terrified, fled from the field.", "At that instant, summoning up his courage, the valiant Nila discharged a crag against that crafty titan, who, seeing it approaching, struck it with his fist and, on the impact, that rock broke and fell on the earth emitting sparks of fire. Then Rishabha, Sharabha, Nila, Gavaksha and Gandamadhana, those five tigers among the monkeys, hurled themselves on Kumbhakama and, in the struggle, showered him with blows from stones, trees, the palms of their hands, feet and fists, attacking that giant on every side. Kumbhakarna, however, scarcely felt those blows and, unheeding, seized the impetuous Rishabha in his two arms. Crushed in this embrace, that bull among the monkeys fell to the ground, his mouth filled with blood.", "Thereafter, in the fight, that enemy of Indra struck Sharabha with his fist, Nila with his knee and Gavaksha with the palm of his hand. Dazed by the blows they had received, terrified, covered with blood, they fell on the earth like Kimshuka Trees that have been uprooted. Those powerful leaders of the monkeys being overcome, the rest hurled themselves in thousands on Kumbhakama and, flinging themselves upon him and climbing about him as if he were a rock, those bulls among the Plavagas, who themselves resembled hills, attacked and bit him. With their nails, teeth, fists and arms, those foremost of monkeys assailed the valiant Kumbhakarna, a veritable tiger in stature, and that titan, covered by thousands of apes, resembled a mountain overgrown by trees. Crushing all those monkeys in his arms, that giant devoured them, as Garuda the serpents. Cast into Kumbhakarna\u2019s mouth, that resembled the pit of hell, the monkeys issued from his ears and nostrils. As high as a mountain in his rage he devoured those monkeys, and that prince of titans crushed them covering the earth with their flesh and blood and ranging through their ranks which he overran, so that he appeared like the Fire of Time itself. Resembling Shakra bearing the thunderbolt in his hand or Death with the noose, so did that powerful titan appear, armed with bis spear, in the fight. As in the summer season, fire destroys the dry forests, so did Kumbhakarna consume the simian ranks.", "Thus decimated, their leaders struck down, the Plavamgamas, wild with terror, emitted dreadful cries and, overpowered again and again by Kumbhakarna, those monkeys fled for refuge to Raghava. Witnessing the massacre of those monkeys, Angada, born of the son of the Bearer of the Thunderbolt, hurled himself in rage upon Kumbhakarna in the struggle. Seizing hold of a great crag, he roared again and again, putting all the titans, who accompanied Kumbhakarna, to flight; thereafter he struck the head of his adversary with the rock, and that enemy of Indra inflamed with anger on receiving the blow, leapt with one bound upon the irascible son of Bali. Emitting loud cries, that titan struck terror among the monkeys and, in his anger, threw his spear with extreme force at Angada, but with a light bound, that valiant lion among the monkeys, an experienced warrior, avoided the impact and leapt on his opponent, striking his chest with the palm of his hand. That violent blow dazed the giant, who resembled a mountain, but regaining his senses that most powerful of titans, doubling his fist, with a mocking laugh, struck, Angada who fell insensible to the earth.", "As that lion among the Plavagas lay stretched unconscious on the ground, Kumbhakarna, brandishing his spear, rushed on Sugriva and, seeing that colossus running towards him, the courageous King of the Monkeys went out to meet him whereupon, beholding that Indra among the Monkeys advancing, Kumbhakarna halted and stood facing him with braced limbs.", "Beholding Kumbhakarna standing still, his body streaming with the blood of the great monkeys whom he had devoured, Sugriva said to him:\u2014", "\u201cIn slaying these warriors you have accomplished a most difficult feat and, by devouring my soldiers, hast acquired immense renown; now let the army of monkeys be, what hast you to do with common folk? Do you seek to bear the weight of this rock I am about to hurl on you, O Titan! Find your satisfaction in slaying me, O Titan, you who resemblest a mountain!\u201d", "At these words of the King of the Monkeys, who was possessed of courage and fortitude, that lion among the titans, answered:\u2014", "\u201cYou are the grandson of Prajapati and the son of Riksharajas, you are energetic and brave, hence thine arrogance, O Monkey!\u201d", "At these words of Kumbhakarna, Sugriva, taking up a stone, hurled it at him suddenly and struck his breast with that missile resembling a thunderbolt. The rock broke on the huge chest of that giant and the titans were appalled, whilst from the ranks of the monkeys rose shouts of joy. Struck by that rocky peak, Kumbhakarna, enraged, roared; opening his huge mouth wide and brandishing his spear, that resembled lightning, he hurled it at the King of the Monkeys and the Bears in order to slay him. As it fell, the son of Anila, Hanuman, with his two hands seized hold of that sharp spear and its gold-encircled shaft loosed by the titan\u2019s arm and, in play as it were, broke that powerful weapon across his knee.", "Seeing his lance shattered to pieces by Hanuman, the army of monkeys, in a transport of delight, began to cheer. Meanwhile hearing those rangers of the woods emitting leonine roars and lauding Maruti in their joy, on beholding his spear shattered, that titan became enraged and, pale with fear, tore off a peak of the Malaya Mountain nearby, in the vicinity of Lanka, hurling it on Sugriva in order to strike him down. Struck by that crag, the Indra of the Monkeys fell on the earth insensible and the Yatudhanas let forth a roar of triumph.", "Thereafter Kumbhakarna, approaching that powerful King of the Monkeys, lifted him up and bore him away like unto a violent wind driving away a cloud and, as he ranged the battlefield dragging Sugriva with him, who resembled a great cloud, Kumbhakarna, with his lofty stature, appeared like Mount Meru of exceedingly high peaks. Having laid hold of Sugriva, the mighty Lord of the Titans turned towards Lanka amidst the acclamations of his own people and the wailing of the Inhabitants of the Celestial Region, who were inconsolable on account of the capture of the King of the Plavamgamas and, having overcome the King of the Monkeys, that enemy of Indra and his rival in power, reflected:\u2014\u2018He being dead, the entire simian host is destroyed together with Raghava!\u2019", "Then Hanuman, the sagacious son of Maruta, seeing Sugriva borne away by Kumbhakarna and the monkeys fleeing, thought to himself:", "\u2018Now that Sugriva has been made captive what ought I to do? Assuredly I shall accomplish that which is fitting; in order to slay this titan, I shall assume the shape of a mountain! When I have destroyed the extremely powerful Kumbhakarna in combat by pounding his body with blows and have delivered the king, the delight of the monkeys will be general! Yet that great monkey is well able to free himself though meseems, that, struck by Kumbhakarna with a rock in the struggle, the Chief of the Monkeys is not yet conscious of his plight. Presently, when Sugriva recovers consciousness, he will know how to save himself and the monkeys in this great conflict. That warrior will not be pleased if I deliver him, for his fair name would be tarnished and irretrievably lost. That is why I shall delay a while so that he may extricate himself from this predicament by his own prowess and I shall confine myself to rallying the scattered forces.\u2019", "Reflecting thus, Hanuman, born of Maruta, sought to instil courage into the simian army.", "Meanwhile, bearing the great and quivering form of the monkey in his arms, Kumbhakarna returned to Lanka, and from the temples, highways, dwellings and city gates, die people honoured him with a rain of flowers. Under the shower of roasted grain and the fragrance of the blossoms with which he was drenched and also on account of the coolness of the royal highway, little by little the valiant Sugriva recovered consciousness. Borne in the arms of his powerful rival and, beholding the great highway of the city, that warrior was assailed by innumerable thoughts\u2014\u2018Taken captive in this way, what can I do now? I shall act in such a way that it is to the advantage of the monkeys.\u2019", "Then with his sharp nails, the King of the Monkeys, instantly attacked the enemy of the Gods and tore off his two ears with his teeth, biting off his nose and splitting his thighs with his feet.", "With his nose and ears torn off by Sugriva\u2019s teeth and nails, Kumbhakama, transported with anger, his limbs covered with blood, threw die monkey down in order to crush him. Flung to the ground with fearful violence and struck by the Enemy of the Gods, Sugriva bounced into the air like a ball and with all speed flew to rejoin Rama.", "Kumbhakama, his ears and nose severed, drenched in gore, shone like a mountain with its torrents and, covered with blood, vomiting blood, that gigantic titan of fearful aspect, the younger brother of Ravana, blazed with anger. Like unto a mass of dark collyrium or an evening cloud, that formidable Ranger of the Night resolved to enter into combat once more and, Sugriva having escaped, that enemy of Indra, furious, immediately threw himself into the straggle but reflecting \u2018I have no weapon\u2019 that ferocious warrior seized hold of a huge hammer. Issuing from the city, the valiant titan began to consume the redoubtable army of the monkeys with the violence of Fire at the destraction of the worlds. Famished and avid for flesh, Kumbhakama entered the ranks of the monkeys and, in his rage, like unto Mrityu at the end of the world period, indiscriminately ate up titan, monkey, Pisaca and bear. Thereafter in his fury, he consumed the monkeys, seizing one, two, three or more in one hand and titans also, thrusting them greedily into his mouth so that he streamed with flesh and blood and, though struck by the peaks of mountains, continued to feast on those monkeys, whilst they, seeing their companions being devoured, took refuge with Rama, whereupon Kumbhakama, in a transport of rage, pursued them in order to consume them. Seizing them in his arms, in the chase, he took hold of them in groups of seven, eight, twenty, thirty and a hundred; his limbs were covered with fat, flesh and blood, while wreaths of tangled entrails hung over his ears, and that colossus, of sharp teeth, began to discharge his weapons so that he appeared like Time at the end of the world.", "At that instant, the son of Sumitra, the scourge of enemy hosts and the destroyer of hostile citadels, enraged, entered the fight and the courageous Lakshmana loosed seven darts into Kumbhakama\u2019s body, aiming a hail of other missiles on him but Kumbhakarna shook off those falling shafts. Then the valiant son of Sumitra was provoked beyond measure and covered the shining armour of that titan, that was made of gold, with his shafts, as a mountain is overlaid with clouds by the wind at evening. Like unto a mass of dark collyrium, that titan, riddled with golden darts, blazed like the sun shining amidst the clouds. And that terrible monster, whose voice equalled the crash of countless thunder-clouds, spoke scornfully, increasing Saumitri\u2019s delight, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou have manifested your courage by entering into combat, fearlessly with me, I who have overcome Antaka himself without difficulty in the field! He who is able to face the rival of Mrityu himself, armed for combat, is worthy of honour, how much more so if he should enter into conflict with him! Mounted on Airavata surrounded by the Gods, Shakra, their king, has never dared to challenge me to battle. This courage from a youth is gratifying to me; now go hence, O Saumitri, I wish to meet Raghava!", "\u201cIn sooth your valour, energy and martial prowess are pleasing to me but my only desire is to slay Rama, when he is slain, all are slain! When Rama has fallen under my blows, I shall fight with all my might against all those who remain on the battlefield!\u201d", "Thus boastfully did the titan speak and Saumitri, with a mocking smile, answered in dread accents saying:\u2014", "\u201cThat your prowess renders you invincible to Shakra and the other Gods is true, O Warrior, and to-day you dost manifest the same valour! Yonder is the son of Dasaratha immoveable as a rock!\u201d", "Hearing these words, that ranger of the night, the mighty and powerful Kumbhakarna, disregarding Lakshmana, passed him by and, causing the earth to tremble, rushed on Rama.", "The son of Dasaratha, Rama, however, loosed some pointed arrows with Indra\u2019s weapon on Kumbhakama\u2019s breast and, wounded by Rama in his furious course, flames mixed with embers shot from his mouth! Pierced by Rama\u2019s arrow, that lion among the titans, emitting a terrible cry, hurled himself full of rage upon Raghava, throwing off the monkeys. With his breast pierced with darts, adorned with peacock\u2019s plumes, his mace fell shattered from his hand and all his weapons were scattered on the earth. Finding himself disarmed, that colossus created a great carnage with his fists and hands. Covered with blood, that streamed from his wounds, like a torrent falling from a mountain, his limbs riddled with arrows, maddened by the smell of blood, he rushed about in his violent rage devouring the monkeys, titans and bears. Brandishing a huge crag, that mighty and formidable giant, the equal of Antaka, hurled it at Rama but before it reached him, that hero struck it in the centre with the aid of seven infallible darts.", "The virtuous Rama, elder brother of Bharata, shattered it with arrows encrusted with gold and, like unto the peak of Meru, that crag, shining with splendour, fell, crushing two hundred monkeys.", "At that instant, the virtuous Lakshmana, after reflecting deeply on the various means of destroying Kumbhakarna, said to Rama:", "\u201cO Prince, that monster is no longer able to distinguish between monkeys and titans; drunk with the smell of blood, he devours friends and foes alike! Let the foremost of the monkeys climb upon him courageously and let their officers and leaders hang upon him on every side; under the heavy load that will crush him as he is rushing over the ground, that insensate one will annihilate the titans and not the monkeys.\u201d", "At these words of that intelligent prince, the valiant monkeys all flung themselves on Kumbhakarna with alacrity and he, full of ire against the monkeys, who had climbed on his back, shook them violently as a fierce elephant his keepers. Seeing the titan shaking himself thus, Rama said to himself: \u2018He is incensed\u2019 and rushed upon him with his excellent bow. His eyes red with anger, the intrepid Raghava, consuming him with his glance as it were, bounded quickly forward, re-assuring the leaders, who were tormenting the mighty Kumbhakarna and, in order to encourage the monkeys, taking hold of his great bow encrusted with gold, that with its cord resembled a serpent, Rama advanced with his huge quiver full of arrows.", "Surrounded by the monkey host, that warrior went forward full of valour, followed by Lakshmana and he beheld the illustrious and mighty Kumbhakarna, the vanquisher of his foes, surrounded by titans, his eyes inflamed, adorned with golden bracelets, pursuing all those monkeys with fury like unto one of the elephants of the four quarters; and he resembled the Vindhya or Mandara Mountains and was vomiting blood like a great cloud pouring down rain. With his tongue he licked the comers of his mouth that were wet with blood while he continued to destroy the simian army like Death at the end of the world.", "Beholding that Prince of the Titans shining like a glowing bmkx, that lion among men stretched his bow, and the sound of that weapon infuriated that foremost of the titans, who, highly provoked, hurled himself on Raghava.", "Meanwhile Rama, whose arms were like unto the great coils of the King of the Serpents, said to Kumbhakama who, possessing the splendour of a mountain, was rushing to attack him like a cloud driven by the tempest:\u2014", "\u201cCome, O Prince of the Titans, tremble not, I await you bow in hand and in an instant will deprive you of life!\u201d", "\u2018It is Rama!\u2019 reflected Kumbhakarna and, bursting forth into hideous laughter, rushed forward in fury, scattering the monkeys on the battlefield. By his monstrous and terrible laughter, like unto the muttering of a thundercloud, he seemed to cleave the hearts of the inhabitants of the woods, and Kumbhakarna, in his great splendour, said to Raghava:\u2014", "\u201cTake me not for Viradha, Kabanda or Khara, Bali or Marica; it is I, Kumbhakarna, who stand here! Behold my dreadful and mighty mace wrought of iron; with this, Devas and Danavas were formerly struck down by me! Do not hold me in contempt in that I possess neither nose nor ears, I do not feel the least discomfort or pain on account of their loss! Manifest the strength of your limbs, O Tiger among the Ikshvakus; having displayed your prowess and might, I shall devour you, O Irreproachable Prince!\u201d", "Hearing him speak thus, Rama loosed one of his plumed arrows at Kumbhakarna that struck him with the force of lightning but that enemy of the Gods was neither shaken nor moved and those shafts, which had pierced seven Sala Trees and slain that bull among the monkeys, Bali, cut into the body of the titan that was as hard as a diamond.", "Then, as though they were drops of water, that enemy of the mighty Indra, drank up those arrows through his body, thus quenching their fury, whilst he whirled his mace in a fine frenzy. And that weapon covered with blood, the terror of the celestial hosts, brandished by that titan with formidable energy, created panic in the simian ranks.", "Then Rama, taking up another arrow named the Vayavya, loosed it against that ranger of the night and cut off the arm with which he held the mace. With his arm severed, he let out a terrible cry and his arm, cut off by Raghava\u2019s shaft, fell with its mace, like unto the peak of a mountain on the army of the King of the Monkeys, crushing it. Thereafter, beside themselves, the monkeys who had escaped the massacre caused by that fall, their limbs lacerated, took refuge in the vicinity and became the witnesses of the terrific struggle between that Indra among men and the Prince of the Titans.", "His arm severed by that arrow, Kumbhakarna resembling the King of the Mountains its peak cloven by a great sword, struck down a tree with his remaining hand and rushed upon that lord of men, but Rama, with a shaft decorated with gold joined to Indra\u2019s weapon, cut off his upraised arm like the coiled body of a snake and the Tala Tree also.", "Beholding the titan with two arms severed who, roaring, was rushing upon him, Rama took out two whetted and crescentshaped arrows and severed his two feet, whereupon the intermediary regions, the four quarters, the caves of the mountain, the vast ocean, the Qty of Lanka and the ranks of the monkeys resounded with the thunder of his fall.", "His arms and legs severed, that titan opened his mouth like Vadavamukha and suddenly rushed howling on Rama like Rahu on the moon in the sky. Thereupon Rama filled his mouth with steel-pointed and plumed shafts decorated with gold and, with his mouth thus filled, he was unable to speak and, emitting inarticulated sounds with extreme difficulty, fell senseless.", "Thereupon Rama selected an arrow bright as the rays of the sun, which resembled the Rod of Brahma at the time of the final dissolution and was fatal to his foes, the weapon of Indra, well-plumed and sharpened, the rival of Maruta in speed, and Rama discharged that arrow, the shaft of which was admirably inlaid with diamonds and gold, brilliant as the flames of a blazing sun, swift as Mahendra\u2019s thunderbolt, against that ranger of the night.", "Loosed from Raghava\u2019s arm, that missile, which lit up the ten regions with its brilliance and which, in its formidable aspect, resembled a smokeless flame, struck that Prince of the Titans, the equal of Shakra and severed his head with its prominent teeth and swinging earrings, like unto the peak of a high mountain, as formerly Purandara severed the head of Vritra. The enormous head of Kumbhakarna with the curls that adorned it, looked like the moon floating in the sky at the time of the sun\u2019s rising, when the night has passed. Severed by Rama\u2019s shafts, the head of the titan resembling a mountain, fell on the earth crushing the highways, residences, gates and edifices of the city, bearing down the high walls also; and that gigantic body of great resplendence belonging to the titan, fell into the sea where it crushed the great sharks, huge fishes and serpents, and plunged into the depths below.", "When Kumbhakarna, that great enemy of the brahmins and the Gods, was slain in combat, the earth shook as all the mountains also and the Celestials shouted for joy. Thereafter Gods, Rishis, Maharishis, Pannagas, Suras, Bhutas, Supamas, Guhyakas and the hosts of Yakshas and Gandharvas, who ranged the skies, loudly extolled Rama\u2019s exploit.", "But on beholding that valiant Prince of the House of Raghu, the adherents and kinsfolk of the Lord of the Nairritas emitted loud cries at Kumbhakama\u2019s fall, as do elephants in the presence of a lion. Having overcome Kumbhakarna in the field, Rama, amidst the simian host, resembled the sun emerging from the jaws of Rahu when it drives away the darkness from the celestial region.", "In their delight, the countless monkeys, whose faces resembled opening lotuses, lauded Prince Raghava, who saw the fulfilment of his desires in the death of his formidable adversary, and the elder brother of Bharata rejoiced that he had slain Kumbhakarna, the Scourge of the Gods, who had never been overcome in any great encounter, as the King of the Celestials rejoiced at the death of the great Asura, Vritra.", "Seeing Kumbhakarna fall under the blows of the exceedingly courageous Raghava, the titans brought the tidings to their King, Ravana, and said:\u2014", "\u201cO King, the rival of Kala is dead! Having overthrown the monkey ranks and devoured the Plavagas, he, for a space, displayed his prowess which has now been extinguished by Rama\u2019s unconquerable strength and half his body lies submerged in the vast ocean. Streaming with blood, his nose and ears severed, his head obstructing Lanka\u2019s gateway, he who resembled a mountain, Kumbhakarna, your brother, struck down by Kakutstha\u2019s arrow, is now but a naked and mutilated corpse, like unto a tree consumed by fire!\u201d", "Hearing this report of the mighty Kumbhakama\u2019s death on the battlefield, Ravana, overwhelmed with distress, swooned away.", "Learning that their paternal uncle had been slain, Devantaka, Narantaka, Trishiras and Atikaya, a prey to grief, groaned aloud, and Mahodara and Mahaparshva, on hearing that their brother had perished under the blows of Rama of imperishable exploits, were seized with anguish.", "Thereafter, regaining his senses with extreme difficulty, that lion among the titans, tormented by the death of Kumbhakarna, his senses troubled, began to lament, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Hero, O Humbler of the pride of your foes, O Mighty Kumbhakarna, urged on by destiny, you have left me for the abode of death! To go whither hast you deserted me without having extracted that thorn from my side or from the side of my kinsfolk? O You powerful warrior, destroyer of hostile ranks, from henceforth I no longer exist since I have lost my right arm, the support that delivered me from the fear of the Gods and Asuras. How has such a warrior, who quelled the pride of the Gods and Danavas, who resembled the Fire of Time, fallen to-day in the fight with Raghava? How has Rama been able, with a single arrow, to stretch you on the ground, you, whom the descent of the thunderbolt could not overwhelm? Seeing you succumb in combat, the Hosts of the Gods, standing in the heavens with the Rishis, emit shouts of joy. Assuredly this very day the Plavamgamas, making use of a favourable occasion, will scale the gates and fortifications of Lanka on every side, which heretofore were impregnable! I have no further need for a kingdom and what shall I do with Sita? Bereft of Kumbhakarna, I no longer wish to live. Since I am unable to kill Raghava, the slayer of my brother in combat, would it not be better to die, for life is empty to me? To-day I shall go where my brother has gone, nay, far from my brother I cannot live for an instant! Witnessing my plight, the Gods, who were formerly wronged by me, will certainly mock me! O Kumbhakama, now that you are dead, how shall I vanquish Indra? Bibishana\u2019s prudent speech, that great soul whom I disregarded in my blindness, has proved true; the cruel end of Kumbhakarna and Prahasta has justified his words! This is the disastrous consequence of that deed of mine, the banishment of the virtuous and fortunate Bibishana.\u201d", "Such were the many burning lamentations to which the Ten-necked Ravana gave voice in the anguish of his soul on account of Kumbhakama, his younger brother, the enemy of Indra, and, knowing him to have perished in combat, he swooned away.", "Hearing the lamentation of the wicked Ravana who was overcome with grief, Trishiras addressed him thus:\u2014", "\u201cO King, brave men do not give way to sorrow even at the death of so valiant a warrior as your younger brother, our uncle. Since you are able to conquer the Three Worlds, O Lord, why, like a common man, dost you suffer your courage to falter? Brahma bestowed on you a spear, mail, a dart, a bow and a chariot harnessed to a thousand mules, sending forth a rumble like unto a thundercloud; furnished with all these weapons, you will vanquish Raghava! Yet if it please you, O Great King, I myself will descend into the arena and bear away your foes, as Garuda the serpents. As Shambara fell under the blows of the King of the Gods and Naraka under those of Vishnu, so shall Rama fall this day, struck down by me on the battlefield.\u201d", "At these words of Trishiras, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, under the sway of destiny, felt himself to be born anew and, hearing Trishiras speak thus, Devantaka, Narantaka and Atikaya, burning with martial ardour, desired nothing more than to enter into combat. \u201cAway! Away!\u201d roared those valiant sons of Ravana, the foremost of the Nairritas, the equals of Shakra in prowess.", "All were able to fly in the air, all were skilled in magic, all had humbled the pride of the Gods, all were invincible warriors, all were endowed with great strength, all enjoyed great renown, of none was it recounted that they had been defeated in battle even by the Gods, Gandharvas, Kinneras or great Serpents. All were expert in the use of weapons, all were courageous and able fighters, all were highly learned and all had been the recipients of great boons.", "Surrounded by his sons, the king, radiant as the solar orb, the destroyer of the power and glory of his foes, shone like Maghavat amidst the Gods, the humbler of the pride of the great Danavas.", "Embracing his sons, he covered them with ornaments and sent them out to fight, heaping blessings upon them. Nevertheless Ravana sent his brothers Yuddhonmatta and Matta to accompany those youthful warriors and watch over them in the struggle. Then those heroes of immense stature paid obeisance to the mighty Ravana, the destroyer of creatures, and, circumambulating him, departed. Thereafter the foremost of the Nairritas, furnished with every kind of medicinal herb and perfume, went away, eager to fight, and Trishiras, Atikaya, Devantaka, Narantaka, Mahodara and Mahaparshva, under the sway of destiny, set out.", "A magnificent elephant, like unto a dark cloud, offspring of Airavata\u2019s race, named Sudarshana, served as Mahodara\u2019s mount and that hero, furnished with every weapon, armed with a quiver, seated on his elephant, shone like the sun on the peak of the Astachala Mountain.", "Trishiras, born of Ravana, was seated in an excellent car drawn by the foremost of steeds and it was filled with weapons of every kind. Standing in his chariot, armed with his bow, he looked as resplendent as a storm cloud on the peak of a mountain, attended by lightning, thunder, meteors and Indra\u2019s bow. With his triple crown, Trishiras shone in his chariot likeHimavat, the Lord of Mountains with its golden crests.", "Then the exceedingly war-like Atikaya, son unto that Lord of the Titans, most skilful of archers, ascended a superb chariot with excellent wheels, stout axles, magnificent steeds, carriage and yoke, rich in quivers and bows, filled with missiles, swords and maces, and that warrior wore a diadem encrusted with gold and covered with gems so that he looked like Meru shining in its own splendour. That mighty Prince of the Titans, surrounded by the foremost of the Nairritas, glowed in his chariot like the God who bears the thunderbolt amidst the Immortals.", "And Narantaka, mounted on a white steed, as swift as thought, harnessed with gold, resembling Ucchairavas, was armed with a javelin like unto a thunderbolt and appeared exceedingly resplendent, resembling the illustrious Guha, the offspring of Shikhin riding on his peacock.", "Devantaka, bearing a gilded iron bar, looked like an incarnation of Vishnu holding the Mandara Mountain in his arms and Mahaparshva, full of strength and energy, brandished a mace like unto Kuvera armed for combat.", "Thereafter those intrepid warriors set out from Lanka like the Gods leaving Amaravati and powerful titans on elephants, horses and in chariots thundering like clouds, followed, armed with excellent weapons; and those youthful beings shone like the blazing sun with their brows encircled with diadems, sparkling in splendour like planets flaming in the heavens and, in the brightness of the raiment in which they were attired, that brilliant cavalcade resembled an autumn cloud or a flock of cranes in the sky.", "Determined to die or vanquish their foe, they went forward in this courageous resolve, eager to fight, boasting, shouting and uttering threats, and those invincible heroes set out furnished with arrows amidst the clamour and clapping of hands, causing the earth to tremble as it were.", "As the roars of their troops seemed to rend the heavens, those mighty titan princes, full of joy, increased their pace and beheld the simian host brandishing rocks and trees, whilst from their side, the courageous leaders of the monkeys observed the titan army with its mass of elephants, horses and chariots advancing like unto a thunder cloud to the sound of hundreds of gongs and, furnished with huge weapons, encompassed on all sides by the resplendent Nairritas, resembling blazing torches or suns.", "Beholding that company approaching, the desire of the Plavamgamas was realised and, armed with huge rocks, they redoubled their cries in their eagerness to fight the titans, who responded with their shouts. Hearing the roars that the monkeys and their leaders let forth, the titan ranks, provoked by the joyous cheering of the enemy, roared with an even greater fury in their extreme valour.", "Thereafter, as they joined issue with that formidable host of titans, the monkeys with their leaders hurled themselves upon them, brandishing sharp rocks like unto mountains and those Plavamgamas, armed with crags and trees, threw themselves upon the titan forces, some fighting in the air and some on the ground. Some amongst those foremost of monkeys fought", "THE RAMAYANA OF VALMIKI with heavily-branched trees and the struggle between the titans and the monkeys became desperate.", "Those monkeys of redoubtable courage let an unequalled shower of trees, stones and rocks fall on the enemy who overwhelmed them with a hail of missiles. Titans and monkeys roared like lions on the battlefield; the Plavamgamas crushed the Yatudhanas with blows from stones and, in fury struck those warriors covered in mail and jewels, mounted in chariots, and on elephants and horses in the fray. Then the Plavamgamas redoubled their attacks against the Yatudhanas with crags that they tore up with their hands. Their bodies tense, their eyes starting from their heads, shouting, they stumbled and fell, whilst those lions among the titans, on their side, pierced those elephants among the monkeys with sharp arrows, striking them with spears, mallets, swords, javelins and lances and they mowed each other down in their desire to triumph. The limbs of monkeys and titans were streaming with the blood of their enemies, and rocks and swords, thrown by the monkeys and titans, covered the blood-stained earth in an instant, so that the ground was smothered with titans like unto mountains, who, mad with martial ardour, had been crushed and mangled by their foes.", "Thereafter the monkeys, giving and receiving blows, their rocks shattered, engaged in a fresh and dreadful fight, using the severed limbs as weapons. And the Nairritas struck the monkeys with their own corpses and the apes struck the titans with the titan dead. Tearing the rocks from the hands of their foes, the titans broke them on the heads of the monkeys who shattered the arrows of the titans, using the pieces to destroy them. And they overwhelmed each other with crags in the battle and monkeys and titans set up a roaring like unto lions.", "Then, their armour and shields pierced, those titans, attacked by the monkeys, dripped blood as trees their sap, and some monkeys in the conflict, destroyed chariots with chariots, elephants with elephants, horses with horses, whilst the titans employed weapons like razors or half moons and Bhallas and pointed shafts in order to shatter the rocks and trees of those intrepid monkeys. In that encounter, the earth became impassable, covered as it was with monkeys and titans mangled and crushed under the rocks and trees in the fight.", "Full of audacity and ardour, the monkeys, engaged in the struggle, casting aside all fear, fought the titans with a light heart and various kinds of weapons.", "Witnessing that appalling melee, the joy of the monkeys and the massacre of the titans, the great Rishis and hosts of Celestial Beings emitted shouts of triumph.", "Narantaka however, mounted on his steed, that was as swift as the wind, with a pointed lance plunged into the thick of the simian ranks like a fish into the sea and that warrior pierced seven hundred monkeys with his effulgent spear and that enemy of Indra, of exceeding courage, in an instant, single-handed, overthrew the army of the foremost of monkeys under the eyes of the Vidhyadharas and Maharishis, hacking a pathvay for himself through the simian ranks, the bleeding flesh its mire, and which was covered with heaps of monkey corpses as high as hills.", "Whenever those lions among the monkeys sought to bar his way, so often did Narantaka cleave their ranks by mowing them down. As a fire burns up a forest, so did he consume those simian battalions and each time those inhabitants of the woods tore up the trees and rocks, they fell under his lance like mountains riven by lightning.", "Brandishing his glittering spear in the forefront of battle, the valiant Narantaka ranged the entire welkin, overthrowing everything in his course as the wind in the rainy season and, whether they stayed at their post or went out to meet him, those courageous monkeys could neither stand against him nor escape from him so that all fell, pierced by that warrior.", "That unique javelin resembling Death itself, bright as the sun, was able, by itself, to destroy the ranks of the monkeys and leave them stretched on the earth, and the impact of that pike resembled the stroke of lightning so that the monkeys were unable to endure it and emitted loud cries. Those high-souled and intrepid monkeys, falling, resembled the peaks of mountains crumbling away, struck by lightning.", "Meanwhile the powerful leaders of the monkeys, who had previously been put to flight by Kumbhakarna, having regained their vigour, were ranged round Sugriva and he, looking about him, observed the army of the monkeys fleeing before Narantaka, terror-stricken and scattering in all directions.", "Witnessing this stampede, he beheld Narantaka, spear in hand, who was advancing, mounted on his steed. At this, the illustrious Sugriva, King of the Monkeys, addressed the youthful Prince Angada, a warrior whose valour equalled Shakra\u2019s, and said:\u2014", "\u201cGo out against that bold titan, who, riding on a horse, is consuming the army I have sent against him and speedily deprive him of his life\u2019s breaths.\u201d", "At this command from his sovereign, the intrepid Angada, the foremost of monkeys resembling a rocky mass, broke away from that company like the sun emerging from a cloud and, with the bracelets he wore, he glittered like a mountain with its metallic veins. Without any weapons save his nails and teeth, that son of Bali, in his great strength, rushed out to meet Narantaka and said to him:\u2014", "\u201cWhy dost you strive with common monkeys? Do you with your spear, the impact of which is equal to lightning, strike my breast which I now present to you!\u201d", "The words of Angada, son of Bali, angered Narantaka, who bit his lip with his teeth hissing like a serpent, and hurled himself upon him in fury. Brandishing his spear, which glittered like fire, he struck at Angada but the weapon broke against the breast of that son of Bali, that was as hard as diamond, and fell to the earth.", "Seeing his lance shattered, like a snake whose powerful coils are sundered by Suparna, the son of Bali raised his hand and struck the head of the steed of his adversary. Sinking to its knees, its eyeballs starting from their sockets, its tongue hanging out, that horse, as high as a hill, fell to the earth, its head crushed by the blow from the palm of his hand.", "Then Narantaka, beholding his steed lying dead, grew enraged and, clenching his fist, struck the son of Bali on the forehead with energy so that the hot blood gushed forth from his injured brow. Now he flared up with wrath and then swooned away and, having lost consciousness awhile, on coming to himself was confused.", "Thereafter Angada, Bali\u2019s mighty son, clenching his fist, which equalled Mrityu\u2019s in strength and resembled a great rock, brought it down on Narantaka\u2019s breast.", "His chest crushed, broken by the shock, vomiting flames, his limbs streaming with blood, Narantaka fell on the earth like a mountain struck by lightning: and when the mighty Narantaka fell in the struggle with Bali\u2019s son, from the sky, the foremost of the Celestials and the monkeys emitted a great shout of triumph! And Angada filled Rama\u2019s heart with joy and he was astonished at his exceedingly difficult achievement. Thereafter that warrior of illustrious exploits eagerly prepared for fresh encounters.", "Seeing that Narantaka was slain, those lions among the Nairritas, Devantaka, Trishiras and Mahodara, the son of Paulastya, wept bitterly.", "Thereafter Mahodara, mounted on that Indra of elephants like unto a cloud, rushed impetuously on the exceedingly energetic son of Bali.", "Then the valiant Devantaka, distressed on account of the calamity that had visited his brother, arming himself with a formidable mace, also ran on Angada and, in his turn, the energetic Trishiras, standing in his chariot, that was as bright as the sun and harnessed to excellent steeds, advanced on the son of Bali.", "Attacked by three of the foremost of titans, who had humbled the pride of the Gods, Angada tore up a many-branched tree, and as Shakra his flaming thunderbolt, hurled that huge trunk with its immense branches at Devantaka. Thereupon Trishiras severed it with his arrows which resembled venomous snakes and Angada, beholding the tree shattered, darted forward and that elephant among monkeys caused a shower of trees and rocks to fall upon the titans.", "Enraged, Trishiras broke them with his whetted shafts and, with the head of his mace, Mahodara crushed them, while Trishiras pursued the valiant Angada with his darts. Thereafter Mahodara urged his elephant to advance on the son of Bali and, in his anger, pierced his breast with Tomaras that were equal to lightning, and Devantaka, provoked, approaching Angada, struck him with his mace and swiftly turned away. The combined assault of those three Nairritas left that illustrious warrior unmoved; that agile and invincible hero however hurled himself in great fury on the colossal elephant belonging to Mahodara and, with the palm of his hand, struck it down.", "Its eyes starting from their sockets, the elephant fell dead and that powerful son of Bali tore out one of its tusks, thereafter, rushing on Devantaka, he dealt him a blow in that struggle which caused him to stumble like a tree buffeted by the wind, and he vomited blood profusely which was the colour of lac. Breathing with difficulty, the energetic and mighty Devantaka, brandishing his mace, struck Angada a violent blow. At the impact, the son of that Indra among Monkeys fell to his knees but soon rose up again and, as he did so, Trishiras, with three infallible and formidable darts, pierced that son of the simian king.", "Meanwhile Hanuman and Nila, beholding Angada assaulted by three of the foremost of the titans, came to his aid, and Nila struck Trishiras with a rock which the skilful son of Ravana broke with his sharp darts. Shattered by a hundred arrows, its surface broken to pieces, that rocky peak, from which sparks and flames spurted, fell.", "Witnessing their astonishment, the courageous Devantaka, full of joy, in the fight flung himself with his mace on the son of Maruta and, as he rushed upon him, that lion among the monkeys leapt to meet him and with his fist struck him a thunderous blow on the head. Thereafter the heroic son of Vayu, that great and powerful monkey, battered in his skull and his roaring caused the titans to tremble. Devantaka, the son of the King of the Titans, gasping from the blow, his skull shattered, his teeth protruding, his eyes starting from their sockets, his tongue hanging out, fell to the earth instantly bereft of life.", "Enraged by the death of the foremost of the titan warriors, that mighty enemy of the Gods, Trishiras, let fall a fearful shower of whetted shafts on Nila\u2019s breast and Mahodara, in fury, quickly mounted a second elephant as high as a hill. As the sun scales the Mandara Mountain, so did he let fall a rain of arrows on Nila as, under a rainbow, a cloud lets loose a shower on a mountain amidst the muttering of thunder. Covered with those darts, with which the valiant titan overwhelmed him, the leader of the monkey army, his limbs pierced, faltering, swooned away; then coming to himself, Nila tore up a rock covered with manybranched trees and, with a terrific bound leapt on Mahodaia and struck him on the head. Crushed by the impact with which that elephant among monkeys had just overwhelmed him, Mahodara fell to earth deprived of life, like a rock riven by lightning.", "Beholding his uncle slain, Trishiras seized hold of his bow and, full of ire, pierced Hanuman with his sharp arrows. Thereupon the son of the Wind, provoked, flung a crag at the valiant Trishiras who broke it to pieces with his whetted shafts. Seeing that his missile was useless, the monkey let fall a rain of trees on the son of Ravana in the struggle and he, observing that shower of trees falling through the air upon him, severed them in fury with his sharp arrows, emitting shouts of triumph. Then Hanuman, leaping upon his steed, tore at it violently with his nails, as the King of the Beasts claws a great elephant.", "Thereafter, from his side, the son of Ravana, as Death with his noose, arming himself with a spear hurled himself on the son of Anila. As a meteor falls from the skies, so did that lance descend unobstructed and that Hon among the monkeys caught it and snapped it, emitting a great shout.", "Beholding that weapon of formidable aspect destroyed by Hanuman, the monkey forces raised joyful roars like unto the rumble of thunder, and Trishiras, the foremost of the titans, drawing his sword, pierced the breast of that Indra of the Monkeys.", "Wounded by the thrust of his sword, the mighty Hanuman, born of Maruta, struck that Three-headed One on the breast with the palm of his hand. Smitten by the blow from Hanuman\u2019s palm, the illustrious Trishiras let his gauntlet fall and dropped swooning to the ground, and as he fell, the great monkey, who resembled a mountain, broke his sword letting out a roar which struck terror in all the titans. Unable to endure the terrible cry of triumph, that ranger of the night rose up and struck Hanuman with his fist. The blow infuriated the great monkey who, in anger, seized hold of the titan by his crown and, as formerly Shakra severed the head of Tashtri\u2019s son, so Hanuman, with a terrific stroke of his sharp sword, cut off his three heads each encircled with a diadem and decorated with earrings. The heads of that enemy of Indra with their large eyes resembling stones, their glances like unto a glowing brazier, fell to the earth like stars falling from the sky. When the enemy of the Gods, Trishiras was slain by Hanuman, who was equal to Shakra in valour, the monkeys shouted in triumph and the earth shook, whilst the titans scattered on all sides.", "Beholding Trishiras, Yuddhonmatta and the irresponsible Devantaka and Narantaka slain, the fury of Matta knew no bounds. Seizing a mace, plated with gold, stained with flesh, blood and foam, immense, glittering, saturated with the enemy\u2019s gore, its point effulgent, festooned with scarlet garlands, die terror of Airavata, Mahapadma and Sarvabhauma, he armed himself with that weapon. In his fury, Matta, that lion among the titans, scattered the monkeys like the Fire at the end of the World Period.", "Meanwhile the monkey, Rishabha, rushed towards Mattanika, the younger brother of Ravana, and stood courageously facing him. Beholding that monkey, as high as a hill, standing before him, Matta, enraged, struck him violently on the chest with his mace that resembled lightning. Under the impact of that weapon, the lion among monkeys, his chest riven, stumbled, blood flowing in streams from the wound. Regaining consciousness after a long time, that prince of the monkeys, his lips trembling, threw a savage glance at Mahaparshva and, with a bound, hurled himself on that titan; thereafter the impetuous leader of the intrepid monkeys, of the size of a mountain in stature, clenched his fist and struck him full on the chest and, like a tree whose roots have been severed, the titan suddenly fell to the earth, his limbs streaming with blood. Thereupon, Rishabha, tore that terrible mace which resembled the Rod of Death, from his grasp, shouting in triumph. For an instant that enemy of the Gods appeared to be dead but, regaining his senses, his colour that of an evening cloud, he threw himself on the son of the Lord of Waters and struck him.", "Dazed by the shock, the monkey sank to the ground, but, having regained consciousness, quickly rose again, and, brandishing the mace resembling a huge rock, he struck the titan a violent blow. When that terrible mace fell on the powerful breast of the enemy of the Gods, hostile to sacrifice and the priests, from his riven breast, blood fell in torrents, as mineral-charged waters flow from a mountain. Thereafter Rishabha, still armed with that formidable weapon, advanced upon him rapidly, striking his mighty adversary again and again and that hero felled Mattanika in the forefront of the battle and, crushed by his own mace, his teeth and eyes pressed in, Matta sank to the earth bereft of life and strength like a rock shattered by lightning.", "At his fall, all those titan warriors fled and, Ravana\u2019s brother being slain, the whole army of the Nairritas, which was as vast as the sea, throwing away their weapons, seeking only to preserve their lives, scattered in all directions like the sea bursting its banks.", "Witnessing the rout of his great army, causing the hair to stand on end, and the death of his brothers the equals of Shakra in prowess and, beholding his two uncles Yuddhonmatta and Matta, the foremost of the titans, struck down in the fight, the illustrious Atikaya, who resembled a rock, the humbler of the pride of Devas and Danavas, he who had been favoured by Brahma, fell into a transport of rage.", "Ascending his chariot, glittering like a hundred suns, that enemy of Indra hurled himself on the monkeys and, stretching his bow, that titan, wearing a diadem and adorned with sparkling earrings, proclaimed his name, emitting a tremendous shout. The proclaiming of his name, the leonine roar and the fearful twanging of his bow-string struck terror in those monkeys and they, beholding that gigantic warrior, reflected:\u2014\u2018Kumbhakarna has come again\u2019 and, in their panic, took shelter one with the other. At the sight of that apparition, like unto Vishnu taking the three strides, the simian warriors, seized with fear, fled in all directions and in the presence of Atikaya, those monkeys, bewildered, sought refuge with the one who is the refuge of all, the elder brother of Lakshmana.", "At that instant, Kakutstha beheld the titan, like unto a mountain, standing in his chariot, afar off, armed with a bow and roaring like a cloud at the time of the dissolution of the worlds. Seeing that monster, Raghava, struck with astonishment, re-assuring the monkeys, enquired of Bibishana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWho is that archer, as high as a hill, with yellow eyes, standing in his vast chariot, harnessed to a thousand horses amidst sharp picks, javelins, gleaming and pointed darts, who shines like Maheshwara among the Bhutas and who is surrounded by glittering spears that fill his car like tongues of the Fire of Death, blazing like a cloud riven by lightning, his best and golden-backed bow illumining his marvellous car on all sides, as Shakra in the heavens? This tiger among titans diffuses a brilliant light over the battlefield as he, the prince of warriors, advances in a chariot reflecting the sun\u2019s rays. On the point of his standard, Rahu has lent him his splendour and his arrows like unto the rays of the sun light up the ten regions; his triply-curved bow, inlaid and backed with gold, resounding like thunder, is as resplendent as Shatakratu\u2019s! With its standard, banner, carriage and the four outriders who escort it, that vast chariot thunders like a storm cloud. Eight and thirty quivers lie in the car with dreadful bows furnished with yellow cords! Two shining swords illumine its sides, their hafts measuring four palms and they are assuredly ten palms in length. With his red garlands, this hero of the size of a mountain, dark of hue, his great mouth like unto death, resembles the sun veiled by cloud! Who is this titan leader with his arms loaded with golden bracelets?\u201d", "Thus questioned by Rama, the descendant of Raghu of immense energy, the extremely illustrious Bibishana answered:\u2014", "\u201cIt is the valiant son of that king who is without equal in might, Dashagriva of great splendour, the younger brother of Vaishravana of terrible exploits, the mighty Ravana, Lord of the Titans. Full of reverence for his elders, renowned for his strength, the most skilful of those versed in the science of arms, he is able to fight on horseback or on the back of an elephant, either with a spear or bow and, whether it be a question of destruction or of sowing dissension or of making peace, of bestowing gifts, of using diplomacy or of strategy, he is highly esteemed. His mother was Dhanyamalini and he is named Atikaya.", "\u201cHaving found favour with Brahma through his chastity and austerity, he has obtained possession of marvellous weapons with which he has overcome his enemies and Svyambhu granted him invulnerability to Gods and Danavas and bestowed this celestial armour on him and a chariot reflecting the sun\u2019s rays. A hundred times has he triumphed over Gods and Danavas, rescued the titans and exterminated the Yakshas. In battle, that intrepid warrior stayed Indra\u2019s thunderbolt with his darts and repelled the noose belonging to the Lord of the Waters, Varuna. He, Atikaya, the most powerful of the titans is the intelligent son of Ravana and the subduer of the pride of Devas and Danavas. Speedily direct thine efforts against him, O Lion among Men, lest, with his arrows, he annihilate the monkey race!\u201d", "At that instant, the mighty Atikaya, shouting again and again, stretching his bow, hurled himself on the monkey host.", "Beholding that fearful monster, standing in his chariot, the greatest of car warriors, the foremost of the illustrious monkey leaders advanced to meet him, and Kumuda, Mainda, Nila and Sharabha, coming together, also went out with trees and rocks.", "Then that mighty titan, prince of warriors, broke those rocks and trees and all the monkeys resisted him, but that virtuous hero of appalling stature, pierced them with iron darts. Overwhelmed by that hail of missiles, their limbs dislocated, demoralized, they were unable to endure the furious assaults of Atikaya and that hero sowed terror amidst the hosts of the valiant monkeys, as a lion, proud of its youth and strength, stands amongst a herd of deer; nevertheless that Indra among the titans desisted from striking any who were defenceless.", "Thereafter with his bow and quiver, he rushed on Rama and addressed him proudly, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHere I stand in my chariot with my bow and arrows in my hand! I do not contend with common soldiers but he, who desires it and is willing, I challenge, here and now, to combat!\u201d", "This speech incensed Saumitri, the slayer of his foes, and, in his rage, he sprang forward with a smile of disdain, bow in hand. Provoked, he advanced, taking an arrow from his quiver and placing himself before Atikaya, stretching his great bow so that the earth, the sky, the sea and the four quarters resounded with the formidable thrumming of the bowstring and terror seized those rangers of the night.", "Hearing that dreadful twanging of Saumitri\u2019s bow, the powerful and valiant son of that Indra of Titans was astounded and, enraged on beholding Lakshmana advancing towards him, he took out a sharp dart and spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cGo hence, O Saumitri, you are but a child without any experience of warfare; why dost you seek to measure your strength with mine, who am the equal of Death! Nay, assuredly the force of these arrows loosed by mine arm may not be withstood by Himavat himself nor the earth nor the heavens. You are seeking to rouse the Fire of Dissolution which, to your good fortune, is now sleeping. Throw away your bow and go hence! Do not sacrifice your life by advancing to meet me! Nevertheless if you are determined not to turn back then stay and, yielding up your life, enter Yama\u2019s abode! Behold my whetted shafts, which wrought of refined gold, subdue the boasting of mine adversaries and resemble Shiva\u2019s trident. This arrow also, resembling a serpent, shall this instant quaff your blood as the king of the beasts drinks the blood of the lord of the elephants.\u201d", "Speaking thus, in rage, the titan placed an arrow on his bow and that speech of Atikaya\u2019s,full of wrath and threats, infuriated Lakshmana who was brave and virtuous by nature so that he answered him proudly and with dignity, saying:\u2014", "\u201cSuperiority is not measured by speech nor is bragging indulged in by men of worth! Here I am armed with my bow, an arrow in mine hand, manifest your prowess, O Wretch! Reveal thyself in deeds and cease to blow thine own trumpet! He who conducts himself with courage is said to be a warrior! You are furnished with every kind of weapon, art mounted on your chariot and hast a bow; now manifest your valour either with arrows or with magic darts! I shall cut off thine head with my whetted shafts as the wind detaches the ripe fruit of the palm from its stem I Soon mine arrows, decorated with refined gold, shall drink your blood, that their points will cause to flow by piercing your limbs. You have said \u2018He is but a child\u2019 but let not this thought cause you to underestimate me. Old or young, know that it is death who is about to enter into combat with you. Vishnu, while yet a child, covered the Three Worlds in his three strides!\u201d", "These words of Lakshmana, fraught with sense and reason, exasperated Atikaya, who laid hold of an excellent dart. At this, Vidyadharas, Bhutas, Devas, Daityas, Maharishis and Guhyakas of great soul, gathered to witness the duel.", "Thereafter Atikaya, provoked, placed an arrow on his bow and loosed it on Lakshmana and it ate up space, as it were, but that sharpened arrow like unto a venomous snake, in the form of a crescent, as it flew was severed by that slayer of his foes and, seeing his dart broken, Atikaya, in a paroxysm of rage took out five arrows at once, and that ranger of the night loosed them on Lakshmana, but before they reached him, the younger brother of Bharata shattered them with his whetted shafts.", "Having severed those missiles with his sharpened darts, Lakshmana, the slayer of his foes, selected a pointed arrow, the brilliance of which sent forth flames and placed it on his excellent bow, then bending it with force, he struck the forehead of that prince of the titans.", "That shaft, sinking into the brow of the terrible titan with the blood that covered it, resembled the King of the Serpents entering a mountain and, as the formidable gateway of Tripura shook, when struck by Rudra\u2019s shaft, so did that titan falter at the impact of Lakshmana\u2019s weapon. Breathing heavily, that colossus reflected \u2018Assuredly the arrow thus loosed proves to me that you are a worthy adversary!\u2019 Thinking thus, he opened his mouth and, stretching his great arms, leaning on his seat, urged his chariot forward.", "One, three, five and seven were the arrows selected by that lion among the titans and, placing them on his bow and drawing it, he let them fly and those shafts, bright as the sun, seemed as it were to set the firmament ablaze. Meantime, unmoved, the younger brother of Raghava severed them with the aid of innumerable whetted darts. Seeing those arrows broken, the son of Ravana, enemy of the Lord of the Gods, incensed, took hold of a sharp weapon and, placing it on his bow, he loosed it with great force against Saumitri, who was advancing towards him, striking him on the breast. Wounded in the breast by Atikaya, Saumitri began to bleed profusely, like an elephant discharging its temporal juices, and that prince plucked out the shaft and threw it away; thereafter he selected a sharp dart to which he joined a mantra-charged arrow and set Agni\u2019s weapon on his bow whereupon both bow and arrow spat forth flames. Thereupon Atikaya, endowed with great strength, took up Rudra\u2019s weapon and fixed an arrow with a golden haft, resembling a serpent, on his bow.", "Then Lakshmana loosed that powerful weapon, his flaming and redoubtable missile on Atikaya like Antaka wielding the Rod of Death. Seeing that shaft joined to the Agneya dart the Ranger of the Night loosed Rudra\u2019s shaft joined to Surya\u2019s weapon, and those two missiles rushed towards each other in space and their flaming points made them appear like infuriated serpents. Devouring each other, they fell on the earth, their fire extinguished, reduced to ashes and bereft of their splendour, and having set the sky ablaze, they lay without lustre on the earth.", "Thereafter Atikaya, enraged, discharged the Aishika Reed joined to Twashtar\u2019s Weapon, but the mighty Saumitri severed it with Indra\u2019s shaft. Seeing the reed broken, that prince born of Ravana, enraged, joined a spear to Yama\u2019s Weapon and that ranger of the night hurled it at Lakshmana who destroyed it with the Vayavya Weapon.", "Then, like a mass of cloud letting loose its rain, Lakshmana, in anger, covered the son of Ravana with a rain of missiles and those shafts coming in contact with Atikaya\u2019s coat of mail which was encrusted with diamonds, had their points shattered and fell on the earth. Seeing them rendered fruitless Lakshmana, the slayer of hostile warriors, covered his adversary with a thousand arrows. Inundated by that hail of shafts, Atikaya, that mighty warrior, whose cuirass could not be pierced, remained unmoved and that hero was unable to inflict a wound on the titan.", "Thereafter the Wind-god approached him and said:\u2014\u201cBecause of the boon received from Brahma, that warrior is clothed in impenetrable armour, do you therefore strike him with the Brahma Weapon, else he may not be slain, his mail being proof against aught else!\u201d", "On hearing Vayu\u2019s words, Saumitri, the equal of Indra in prowess, instantly took up a dart of incredible velocity and joined it to Brahma\u2019s Weapon. Having placed that excellent weapon with the foremost of arrows furnished with sharp points on his bow, every region, the sun, moon and the great planets were struck with terror and the heavens and earth also shook. Then, having fixed the Brahma Weapon on his bow, that missile, the stem of which being like death\u2019s messenger and equal to lightning, Saumitri let it fly on the son of Indra\u2019s foe. And Atikaya beheld that shaft loosed by the mighty-armed Lakshmana, swift as the tempest, with its haft encrusted with gold and diamonds, falling upon him and beholding it, immediately struck at it with his innumerable shafts but that arrow, swift as Suparna himself, flew towards him with extreme velocity and seeing it draw near, like Death at the time of dissolution, Atikaya struck at it with lances, spears, maces, axes, picks and arrows with unrelenting energy, but those weapons of marvellous aspect were rendered fruitless by that flaming dart, which, striking him, severed his head with its diadem.", "Cut off by Lakshmana\u2019s arrow, the head instantly fell on the earth with its crown like unto the peak of Himavat. Then those rangers of the night, who had escaped the slaughter, beholding the body lying on the ground, its raiment and adornments in disarray, were thunderstruck and, their features distored, those unfortunate beings, exhausted with fighting, suddenly began to emit piercing and inarticulate cries. Thereafter those titans, who surrounded their dead leader, terrified, without paying him honour, fled towards the city.", "The monkeys, however, their faces shining like full-blown lotuses, in their delight, all paid homage to Lakshmana on account of the success he had won in striking down that formidable adversary who was renowned for his prowess and theretofore invincible.", "Hearing that Atikaya had been slain by the mighty Lakshmana, Ravana became extremely anxious and spoke as follows:\u2014", "\u201cDhumraksha, who is full of ardour and the most skilled in the use of arms, Akampana, Prahasta, and Kumbhakarna, those valiant titan warriors eager for combat, the destroyers of hostile forces, ever invincible, brave titans of immense stature who were versed in the use of every weapon, have fallen with their troops under the blows of Rama of imperishable exploits. Yet many powerful warriors were struck down by my son Indrajita, who is renowned for his strength and prowess; those two brothers were fettered by his formidable shafts bestowed on us as a boon. All the Gods and Asuras combined, despite their power, could not have broken those fearful bonds, nor the Yakshas, Gandharvas or Pannagas! I do not know by what force, magic or supernatural means, those bonds were severed by those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana.", "\u201cThose courageous titans, who went out to fight at my command, have all perished in combat with the exceedingly valiant monkeys. Henceforth I do not see who, on the battlefield, will be able to slay Rama and Lakshmana or the powerful Sugriva and his forces.", "\u201cAh! How mighty is Rama! How great is the range of his shafts! Those titans, who challenged this warrior, have all been destroyed! Now, on his account, let defences be set up everywhere, both in the city and round the Ashoka Grove where Sita is being guarded. Let the entries and exits be patrolled continuously by our sentinels, wherever they are posted 1 Establish yourselves with the foremost battalions everywhere in order to observe the movements of the monkeys, O Nightrangers! In the evening, at midnight or at dawn, no matter when, do not relax your vigilance in regard to the simian army. Observe what troops are placed in the line by the enemy, how they advance and where they halt; let the gateways and turrets be barricaded at once!\u201d", "All the titans listened to the commands of the mighty Lord of the Titans and went away to carry them out. Ravana, the King of the Titans, however, having issued these orders, exceedingly despondent, entered his abode, the fire of his anger smouldering within him, and that powerfill monarch of those rangers of the night, reflecting on the misfortune that had befallen his son, sighed without ceasing.", "The titans, who had escaped the slaughter, hastened to apprise Ravana of the death of their leaders, Devantaka and others, as also Trishiras and Atikaya.", "Hearing these mournful tidings, great tears immediately filled the king\u2019s eyes and for a long time he remained absorbed in the melancholy thought of the death of his sons and brothers.", "Beholding the wretched monarch plunged in an ocean of grief, Indrajita the son of that Lord of the Titans, the foremost of warriors, addressed him thus:\u2014", "\u201cO My Dear Father, since Indrajita still lives, do not give thyself up to despair! O Prince of the Nairritas, he whom the enemy of Indra strikes with his shafts in the fight is not able to preserve his life. To-day you shalt see Rama and Lakshmana lying stretched on the earth, their bodies pierced, torn to pieces by mine arrows, their limbs riddled with my whetted shafts. Bear witness to the well-considered vow of Shakra\u2019s enemy re-inforced by my prowess and the divine power! This very day I shall overwhelm Rama and Lakshmana with arrows that never miss their target. Let Indra, Vaivasvata, Vishnu, Rudra, the Sadhyas, Vaishvanara, Candra and Surya this day witness mine immeasurable piowess as redoubtable as that of Vishnu at Bali\u2019s place of sacrifice!\u201d", "Having spoken thus, that rival of the Lord of the Celestials, craved permission of the king to depart and with fearless soul ascended his chariot, that was as swift as the wind, harnessed to excellent steeds and furnished with weapons, resembling the car of Hari himself. Then he set out for the battlefield immediately and that magnanimous hero was escorted by innumerable warriors, full of ardour, bearing great bows in their hands.", "As they advanced, some on the backs of elephants, others on prodigious mounts such as tigers, scorpions, cats, mules, buffalo, serpents, boars, cheetahs, lions and jackals, as large as hills, crows, herons and peacocks, those titans of redoubtable courage were armed with javelins, hammers, sabres, axes and maces. To the sound of conches and the rolling of drums, that valiant enemy of the King of the Gods rushed out to fight. With his parasol, pearly like the moon, that slayer of his foes shone like the firmament when that orb is full. Fanned by marvellous chowries with elegant handles, that warrior, adorned with golden ornaments, the foremost of archers, Indrajita, blazed like the solar disc and he, whose strength was irresistible, illumined Lanka like the burning sun in the sky. Then that intrepid subduer of his foes, on reaching the battlefield, ranged the titans round his chariot and, according to the traditional rites, that Prince of the Titans prayed to the God who feeds on sacrificial offerings, whose brilliance he possessed, reciting the most auspicious mantras, and, offering libations of Soma and roasted grain, with garlands and perfumes, that resplendent leader of the titans invoked Pavaka.", "Thereafter he brought there weapons such as Sharapatras, Samidhs and Bibhitakas with red robes and an iron spoon and, heaping the fire with Sharapatras and Tomaras, he seized hold of a live goat by the neck.", "Blazing up suddenly the fire gave off no smoke but manifested the signs betokening victory and, having been lit, the flames bright as gold, whirling in a southerly direction, passed through the crucible and instantly consumed the offerings.", "Thereafter Indrajita, who was skilled in handling arms, took out the Brahma-weapon and pronounced a mantram on his bow, his chariot and on all. Then he, having uttered the sacred formula and invoked Pavaka, the firmament, the sun, the planets, the moon and the stars, trembled. Having called on the God of Fire, whose brilliance he possessed, he, the equal of Indra in power, whose strength was unimaginable, disappeared in the sky with his bow, arrows, sword, chariot, horses and spear.", "Then the army of titans, abundantly furnished with horses and chariots, flags and pennants, burning to fight, set out emitting war cries and, in the struggle, those titans, full of rage, attacked the monkeys with darts of different kinds which were sharp, swift and beautifully wrought, and with spears and hooks. Beholding them, the son of Ravana, addressing those rangers of the night, cried out:\u2014\u201cAttack the foe speedily whom you are burning to destroy! Be of good cheer!\u201d", "At these words, the titans, in their anxiety to triumph, roared aloud and caused a hail of missiles to descend on those redoubtable monkeys. Arming himself with arrows, maces and clubs, Indrajita, on his side, in the midst of the titans, assaulted the monkeys from where he stood invisible in the sky.", "Then those monkeys, struck down in the fight, instantly began to assail Ravani with blows from stones and trees and, full of anger, Indrajita, born of Ravana, that hero full of power, smote the monkeys with a single lance and, in fierce fury, pierced five, seven and nine monkeys at one time to the great delight of the titans. Thereafter that invincible warrior crushed those monkeys under his shafts that glittered like the sun and were decorated with gold.", "Their limbs pierced, the monkeys, overwhelmed by those arrows, fell like great Asuras destroyed by the Gods. Before this second Aditya who consumed them with those formidable weapons as his rays, those lions among the monkeys fled away, filled with terror. Their bodies mutilated, their senses confused, they stampeded, bathed in blood and terrified but, in their devotion to Rama, those monkeys, willing to sacrifice their lives, suddenly halted and returned shouting, armed with rocks, and, closing their ranks, showered down a hail of trees, crags and stones on Ravani.", "That murderous and fearful avalanche of trees and rocks was however dispersed by the mighty Indrajita, who was ever victorious in combat and, with his arrows as bright as fire, resembling serpents, that prince pierced the ranks of his foes. With eighteen penetrating darts he wounded Gandhamadana; with nine others he struck Nala, who stood some way off, and, in his great strength, he assailed Mainda with seven arrows, tearing out his entrails, and Gaja with seven blunted shafts. Thereafter he pierced Jambavan with ten arrows, Nila with thirty and Sugriva, Rishabha, Angada and Dvivida with dreadful flaming arrows that had been received as boons, thus rendering those foremost of the monkeys insensible, who, struck by innumerable shafts fell under his furious onslaught so that he appeared like the Fire of Death itself.", "With the aid of arrows as bright as the sun, loosed with skill, that were exceedingly swift, he scattered those monkey divisions in that great fight and, with transports of the keenest joy, that renowned warrior, born of the Indra of the Titans, witnessed the entire simian army, bathed in blood, overwhelmed with that rain of missiles.", "Under that shower of arrows and cruel hail of weapons with which he assailed them, the valiant Indrajita ranged the monkey ranks spreading destruction. Then, leaving his army behind, he speedily flung himself on the monkey forces in that great fight, covering them with a huge wave of formidable shafts like the downpour from a dark cloud.", "Victims of his magic arts, their bodies crushed by those missiles loosed by that vanquisher of Shakra, the monkeys, who were as large as rocks, emitted piteous cries, falling in the fray like great hills struck by Indra\u2019s thunderbolt, and they could see nothing but those sharp arrows decimating their ranks, whilst the enemy of the King of the Gods, that titan, veiled in his magic power, remained invisible. Then that illustrious Prince of the Titans let fly his whetted shafts that shone like the sun in all directions covering the foremost of the monkeys and destroying them; and he caused spears, swords and axes resembling fire, shooting forth flames like a glowing brazier from which sparks fly, to fall on the ranks of the foremost of the Plavagas. Under the arrows and flaming darts, with which the vanquisher of Indra overwhelmed them, the monkey leaders resembled Kimshuka Trees in full flower.", "As they looked upwards, some, struck in the eyes were blinded, and jostling one another, fell to the earth. With the aid of javelins, spears and whetted shafts charged with mantras, Indrajita, the Prince of the Titans, crushed all those warriors, Hanuman, Sugriva, Angada, Gandhamadana, Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarshin, Mainda, Dvivida, Nila, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Kesarin, Hariloman, Vidyuddamshtra, Suryanana, Jyotimukha, Dadhimukha, Pavakaksha, Nala and Kumuda and, having disarmed those monkey leaders, he caused a shower of glittering darts, like unto the rays of the sun, to fall on Rama, and Lakshmana who accompanied him.", "Under the wave of arrows, which he heeded as little as though they were drops of rain, Rama, of prodigious splendour began to ponder within himself and said to his brother:\u2014", "\u201cO Lakshmana, having overwhelmed the simian army, that Indra among the Titans, the enemy of the Gods, trusting in his powerful weapon, now attacks us afresh with his sharp darts! In virtue of the boon he has received from Svyambhu, that hero, full of energy and prowess, has made himself invisible despite his formidable size. How may Indrajita, who has taken up arms against us, be struck down in combat when his body is invisible?", "\u201cI recognize this to be the weapon and power of Svyambhu, the Beneficent and Incomprehensible One! With a tranquil heart, O Sagacious Lakshmana, bear the fall of this shaft with me to-day! Let this Indra of Titans, the leader of them all, cover us with a rain of darts! The entire army of the Monkey King, his greatest warriors having been struck down, appears to have lost its splendour, yet when Ravani beholds us lying stretched insensible and impotent, manifesting neither joy nor anger, he will certainly rejoin Ravana, the enemy of the Gods, in his abode, having gained a great victory.\u201d", "Thereafter Indrajita, overwhelmed them both with a hail of missiles and, having reduced them to a state of impotence, that Indra among the Titans set up a shout of triumph.", "In this way, having overcome the simian army in battle, as also Rama and Lakshmana, he returned at once to the city ruled by Ravana\u2019s hand where, extolled by the Yatudhanas and filled with delight, he related all to his sire.", "[Full title: On Jambavaris Instructions, Hanuman goes to the Mountain of Medicinal Herbs].", "Seeing the two Raghavas lying unconscious on the field, the army of monkeys and their leaders lost courage, nor did Sugriva, Nila, Angada or Jambavan dare to take any action.", "Thereupon Bibishana, foremost among the wise, seeing the general despondency, with his sagacious words re-assured those warriors belonging to the simian king, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAlthough those two princes are lying here without consciousness, have no fear, you have no cause to despair; it is in order to honour Svyambhu\u2019s pledge that they have allowed themselves to be struck down by Indrajita with his rain of missiles! Indrajita received that excellent weapon that is not to be withstood from Brahma. It is in order to render homage to that God that the two princes have fallen in the fight; it is therefore not the moment to lose heart!\u201d", "Having paid honour to Brahma\u2019s weapon, Maruti answered Bibishana, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLet us console those who still live among the army of the monkeys, which has been decimated by that celestial shaft.\u201d", "Thereupon, with torches in their hands, those two heroes, Hanuman and the foremost of the titans, began to range the battlefield together during the night, and they beheld the earth covered with tails, hands, breasts, feet, fingers, necks and severed limbs, scattered here and there, from which the blood flowed, and monkeys as large as hills fallen on the field, their weapons still glowing.", "Thereafter Bibishana and Hanuman beheld Sugriva, Angada, Nila, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarshin as also Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha, Dvivida and all those monkeys lying on the battlefield. Seventy-six kotis of brave monkeys had been overthrown in the fifth and last period of the day by Brahma\u2019s cherished weapon.", "While looking on that formidable army, that had fallen under the blows of the enemy and that resembled the waters of the sea, Hanuman, accompanied by Bibishana, began to search for Jambavan and, beholding that aged one, bowed with the weight of years, riddled with a hundred arrows, the valiant son of Prajapati, like unto an extinguished brazier, the grandson of Paulastya[1] rushed towards him and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Hero, is it possible that those penetrating shafts did not cut off thine existence?\u201d", "Hearing the voice of Bibishana, Jambavan, the foremost of the bears, who was scarcely able to speak, answered saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Indra among the Nairritas, you who art full of valour, I recognize your voice, O Pious One, say whether he, on account of whom Anjana and Matarishvan are happy parents, that hero, Hanuman, still lives?\u201d", "On this enquiry from Jambavan, Bibishana replied:\u2014\u201cWhy dost you remain silent concerning the two princes and question me on the subject of Maruti? How is it that King Sugriva, Angada or even Raghava do not inspire you with an affection as great as that which you bearest for the son of Vayu, O Venerable One?\u201d", "Hearing Bibishana\u2019s words, Jambavan answered:\u2014\u201cHear, O Tiger among the Nairritas, as to why I enquire concerning Maruti; it is, that should the valiant Hanuman still live, even if the army has been destroyed, it is not destroyed! If Maruti yet lives, O Dear Friend, he, the rival of Maruta, the equal of Vaishvanara in power, then there is still the possibility of survival!\u201d", "At that moment the son of Maruta approached that venerable one with reverence, paying obeisance to him and touching his feet and the voice of Hanuman moved his heart, so that the Prince of the Plavagas felt new life had been bestowed on him.", "Thereafter the illustrious Jambavan said to Hanuman:\u2014", "\u201cCome hither, O Mighty One, it is for you to deliver the monkeys, none other has the power and you are their best friend. This is the moment to demonstrate your prowess, I see no other; do you bring joy to those brave troops of bears and monkeys! Heal those two unfortunate beings, Rama and Lakshmana of their wounds. Prepare to cross far above the great path of the ocean in order to reach Himavat, the highest of mountains, O Hanuman, and there direct your course to that golden Peak Rishabha, difficult to scale and of an extreme altitude. There the summit of Mount Kailasha will be seen by you, O Slayer of Your Foes! Between the peaks of these two mountains, you will behold the mountain of medicinal herbs rising in unparalleled splendour, where every kind of healing plant abounds. O Foremost of the Monkeys, you will discover four plants growing on the summit, the radiance of which illumines the ten regions. They are\u2014Mritasamjivani (\u2018Reviver of the Dead\u2019), Vishalyakarani (\u2018Healer of wounds inflicted by darts\u2019), Suvarnakarani (\u2018That which heals the skin\u2019) and Sandhani (\u2018That which produces a salve for wounds\u2019), herbs of rare value. Gather all four, O Hanuman, you the son of the Bearer of Fragrance, and return to aid the monkeys by reviving them.\u201d", "At these words of Jambavan, Hanuman, born of Maruta, felt himself infused with tremendous power, as the ocean heaves with the force of the wind. Standing on the summit of the high mountain which he crushed with his weight, the valiant Hanuman looked like a second mountain. Trodden down by the monkey\u2019s feet, the mountain sank, unable to endure the load that pressed so heavily upon it, and the trees fell to the ground and caught fire on account of the rapid course of the monkey, whilst the peaks, trampled down by him, were shattered. Thus crushed, its trees, rocks and soil torn up, it became impossible for the monkeys to stand erect on that high mountain which was shaking, and Lanka, with its great gateways destroyed, its dwellings and bastions crumbling, full of terror-stricken titans, appeared to be reeling. Then the son of Maruta, like unto a mountain, trod that support of the earth under foot, causing the earth and sea to quake; pressing the mountain under his feet, he opened his mouth like the fearful jaws of Vadava and began to roar with all his might in order to strike terror into the titans and, when they heard that formidable clamour, those lions among the titans in Lanka were paralysed with fear.", "Thereafter, paying obeisance to Samudra, Maruti, the scourge of his foes, possessed of redoubtable courage, for Raghava\u2019s sake prepared himself for the undertaking.", "Raising his tail which resembled a serpent, flattening his ears and opening his mouth wide, like unto the entry to Vadava, he sprang into the air with an impetuous bound, drawing trees with their branches, stones and a rabble of monkeys in his wake and, borne away by the force of the wind produced by the movement of his arms and thighs, deprived of resistance, they all fell into the ocean.", "Then the son of Vayu, stretching his two arms that resembled the coils of serpents, with a strength equal to the enemy of reptiles, set out in the direction of that celestial peak of the Lord of the Mountains, displacing all the cardinal points as it were. And he observed the ocean that rolled on and on with its garlands of waves and all the creatures moving in its depths while he coursed on like the discus loosed by the fingers of Vishnu. Mountains, flocks of birds, lakes, rivers, ponds, vast cities, crowded provinces, passed under his gaze as he journeyed on with the swiftness of his sire, the Wind-god. And the agile and courageous Hanuman, the rival of his father in valour, strove to follow the orbit of the sun and, in extreme haste, the foremost of monkeys went on with the speed of the wind and all the quarters re-echoed to the sound.", "Then Maruti, that great monkey, full of energy, remembered Jambavan\u2019s words and suddenly Himavat appeared with its many streams, its great number of caves and waterfalls, the many kinds of trees that adorned it and its peaks like a mass of white clouds lovely to look upon. Thereafter he approached that King of Mountains and, as he drew near that Indra of high mountains with its golden peaks of great altitude, Hanuman beheld those illustrious and holy retreats of the ascetics, frequented by the foremost of the Gods, Rishis and Siddhas,and he saw Brahmakosha (The Place of Hiranyagarbha), Rajatalaya (The Place of the Silver-navelled One. A mountain near Kailasha), Shakralaya (The Abode of Shakra.), Rudrasharapramoksha (The place where Rudra discharged the arrow at Tripura), Hayanana (The Place of the Horse-necked One; See Hayagriva) and the blazing Brahmashiras (The Abode of the Deity presiding over the Brahma Weapon) and he recognized the servants of Vivasvat (The God of Death.).", "Thereafter he beheld the Vahnyalaya (The Abode of the Fire God) and the Vaishravanalaya (The Abode of Kuvera), Suryaprabha and the Suryanibandhana (The Place where the suns meet), Brahmalaya (The Abode of the Four-faced Brahma.) and Shankarakarmukha (The Place of Shankara\u2019s bow.), thus did he perceive the centre of the earth; and Hanuman also discovered the steep Mountain Kailasha and the Rock of Himavat (The rock on which Rudra sat to practice asceticism) and Vrisha (The name literally means: \u2018The Bull of Shiva\u2019), that sublime and golden mountain, illumined by the radiations of all the curative herbs, the King of Mountains, where all the simples grow. Astonished on beholding that mountain wreathed in phosphorescent fires, the son of Vasava\u2019s messenger descended on that Lord of Hills covered with medicinal herbs, in order to gather them.", "Then the great monkey, born of Maruta, covered a thousand leagues, ranging that mountain where those specifics grew on that most elevated of peaks; nevertheless, those sovereign remedies, knowing that Hanuman had come to gather them, made themselves invisible. Thereupon that hero, not being able to see them, grew angry and, in his ire, began to emit loud cries. Impatient, his glances inflamed, he questioned that mountain, the support of the earth, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat impels you, you who art of such strength, to show thyself (to be) without pity for Raghava? O King of the Mountains, the hour having struck, overcome by the power of mine arms, you shalt see thyself shattered to pieces!\u201d", "Thereupon, seizing hold of the crest with its trees, elephants, gold and many kinds of ore that adorned it, with its summit of  jagged peaks and sublime and radiant plateaus, he broke it off roughly.", "Having thus uprooted it, he flew into the air to the great terror of the worlds, the Gods and their leaders and to the acclamations of innumerable inhabitants of the sky. Thereafter he flew away with the speed of Garuda, carrying that rocky peak which shone like the luminous orb and he too was filled with radiance as he followed the path of the sun. Coursing thus in the vicinity of that orb, he appeared to be its very image, and that peak spread a great light over the son of the God, who is the bearer of fragrance, so that it appeared as if Vishnu Himself, armed with his discus of a thousand fiery rays, were in the sky.", "Then the monkeys, observing him, shouted with delight and he also on beholding them, emitted tremendous roars.", "Hearing those cries of triumph, the inhabitants of Lanka set up a dreadful clamour and Hanuman alighted on a high rock in the midst of that host of monkeys.", "Thereafter he bowed to the chief monkeys and embraced Bibishana.", "Then the two sons of that King of Men, having inhaled those wonderful herbs, were instantly healed of their wounds and the others, those valiant monkeys, rose up in their turn and all the brave Plavagas were instantly cured of their wounds and sufferings, having inhaled those wonderful herbs and those who had been slain returned to life like sleepers waking when the night is over.", "From that moment the monkeys and titans fought in Lanka itself, and thereafter on Ravana\u2019s command and out of perversity, all the titans struck down in the fight by the valiant monkeys, both wounded and dead were thrown into the sea.", "Meantime the son of the Bearer of Fragrance, Hanuman, of formidable bounds, carried the peak of medicinal herbs back to Himavat and returned with speed to rejoin Rama.", "FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES:", "[1]:", "Ravana and his younger brother Bibishana were descended from the Sage Paulastya", "At that moment, Sugriva, the illustrious King of the Monkeys, addressed Hanuman in words fraught with wisdom, saying:\u2014", "\u201cNow that Kumbhakarna has been slain and the youthful princes have perished, Ravana can no longer harm us! Therefore let those valiant and agile Plavamgamas, who are able to do so, hurl themselves on Lanka with torches in their hands!\u201d", "Meanwhile the sun had withdrawn behind the Astachala Mountains and at the dread hour of night, the foremost of the monkeys approached Lanka with flaming torches and those simian ranks, furnished with fiery brands, rushed in on all sides so that the grim-visaged titan sentinels instantly fled away. Then the monkeys joyfully set fire to gates, pavilions, highways and byways and buildings of every kind, and the dwellings were consumed by thousands, and the public monuments, as high as mountains, toppled down and fell to earth; all was consigned to the flames! Sandal of great price, pearls, brilliant jewels, diamonds and coral, woollen cloths, rich silks, carpets of many kinds made of lambs wool, vases and weapons of gold, countless rare objects, harness and horse cloths, collars and girths for elephants, chariots with their furnishings and decorations, warrior\u2019s armour, trappings for their mounts, swords, bows and bow-strings, arrows, spears, goads and lances, cloths of wool and horsehair, tiger skins, innumerable perfumes, palaces enriched with pearls and precious gems, with stores of arms of every kind, all were burnt to ashes. And the fire consumed all the buildings with their ornamentation and devoured the dwellings of the titans who inhabited them.", "Clad in armour encrusted with gold, decorated with garlands and other ornaments, their eyes wild with inebriation, wine caused those inhabitants of Lanka to reel as they walked, whilst courtesans clung to their apparel, and they were incensed with fury against their foes. Armed with maces, picks and swords, they were gorging themselves with meat and drink or sleeping on sumptuous beds with the objects of their desire. Full of terror they fled distracted, carrying their sons with them in all haste, whilst their luxurious and splendid mansions, which combined every comfort, were consumed by fire in hundreds and thousands on every side. Those golden buildings that seemed to touch the skies constructed like moons and crescents with their magnificent upper galleries, their trellised windows and terraces decorated with pearls and crystal, re-echoed to the cries of herons, peacocks and the tinkling of ornaments.", "Asleep in the many-storied residences, the lovely courtesans, awakened by the flames that scorched them, threw off the jewels that impeded their flight, crying:\u2014\u2018Ah! Alas 1\u2019 in piercing tones.", "Meanwhile the palaces crumbled in the fire that consumed them, and those flaming mansions spread their light afar, like unto the summits of high mountains when struck by Indra\u2019s thunderbolts, so that it appeared as if the Peak of Himavat itself were ablaze.", "The houses on all sides, wreathed in fire, resembled blossoming Kimshuka Trees; thus did Lanka appear that night! Elephants and horses that had broken loose from their keepers gave the city an appearance of the ocean with its maddened sharks and crocodiles at the time of the end of the world! Here a horse was seen running unchecked or an elephant standing motionless in terror. Lanka in flames illumined the sea, the waters of which, streaked with shadows, seemed to flow with blood.", "In an instant, the monkeys had set fire to the city and it looked as if the whole earth were aflame, as at the dread destruction of the world.", "Seeing the smoke, the women began to shriek and, when the flames reached them, their cries could be heard at a hundred leagues distance. The titans rushed out of the city, their limbs covered with burns, whereupon the monkeys, eager to come to blows, fell upon them. Monkeys and titans set up such a clamour that it caused the ten regions, the ocean and the whole earth to re-echo.", "Meantime, healed of their wounds, the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, intrepid warriors, took up their marvellous bows and, when Rama drew that excellent weapon, the dreadful thrumming thereof struck terror in the titans and, whilst he bent his great bow, Raghava shone in glory, as Bhava in his fury when he stretches the bow of the Vedas.", "Under the shafts loosed by that warrior, one of the gates of the city, resembling the peak of Mount Kailasha, fell shattered on the earth, and beholding Rama\u2019s arrows falling on temples and mansions, those Indras among the titans made a supreme effort and, while they closed their ranks, they emitted leonine roars so that it appeared as if the Night of Final Dissolution was at hand.", "Then the leaders of the monkeys received orders from the magnanimous Sugriva, who said:\u2014", "\u201cEnter the nearest gate and begin to fight, O Plavagas 1 If any amongst you acts contrary to my orders, let him be slain!\u201d", "Thereupon the monkey leaders bearing torches in their hands, took up their positions at the entrance of the city and, beholding them, Ravana, transported with fury yawned and the ten regions were thrown into confusion so that it seemed as if Rudra were manifesting his wrath. In his rage he sent out Kumbha and Nikumbha, both born of Kumbhakarna, with innumerable titans and, at his command, Yupaksha, Shonitaksha, Prajangha and Kampana set out with the two sons of Kumbhakarna.", "Then with the roar of a lion, Ravana said to those valiant warriors:\u2014", "\u201cGo forth immediately, O Titans!\u201d", "At his command, those brave titans, with their shining weapons, left Lanka emitting a continuous clamour and, with the splendour of their ornaments and persons they illumined the whole firmament as did the monkeys also with their torches.", "Then the light of the moon and stars and the brilliance of the two armies irradiated the heaven whilst the rays of the moon, their ornaments and the planets lit up the ranks of monkeys and titans on all sides and the light from the half-demolished mansions projected lurid flames over the flowing and tumultuous waves.", "With their flags and pennants, their swords and excellent axes, their formidable cavalry, chariots and elephants, their innumerable hosts of infantry, their spears, maces, sabres, javelins, darts and shining bows, that terrible army of titans of redoubtable valour and ardour seemed to be furnished with flaming missiles and, amidst the clash of hundreds of gongs, their arms, encased in golden sheaths, were brandishing axes, and the javelins of the titans rang as they struck with their arrows and their great bows, whilst the air was permeated with the fragrance of their garlands and the aroma of wine.", "Beholding that formidable army of titans that was not to be withstood, emitting the muttering of a great cloud, the Plavamgamas were agitated and, whilst their terrible opponents advanced towards them they let forth loud cries.", "Thereafter the enemy forces hurled themselves upon them like moths into a flame and, their maces whirling in their fevered hands, emitted lightning flashes which increased the exceeding splendour of that host of excellent titans.", "Meanwhile, as if a prey to intoxication, the monkeys rushed forward eager to fight, striking those rangers of the night with blows from trees, rocks and fists, whilst they advanced on them loosing their sharp arrows. Then those titans of immense energy, cut off the heads of the monkeys who tore off their ears with their teeth and battered in their skulls with their fists, crushing their limbs with stones as they moved about. Other rangers of the night, of grim aspect, struck the foremost of the monkeys here and there with their sharp swords and the slayer was slain in his turn, cursing and biting as they massacred each other. Then one cried \u2018Strike!\u2019 and was struck in his turn, whilst another called \u2018It is for me to deal the blow\u2019 and yet others called in chorus \u2018Why trouble thyself? Stay!\u2019", "Amidst the stained missiles, armour and shattered weapons, long spears were thrust forward and blows from fists, maces, sabres, javelins and ploughshares were given. Then the encounter between monkeys and titans assumed terrifying proportions and, in the conflict, the rangers of the night slew their enemies in tens of sevens and, in their turn, the army of titans, their raiment in disorder, their armour and standards shattered, were assaulted and hemmed in on all sides by the monkeys.", "At the height of that appalling struggle in which so many valiant soldiers perished, Angada advanced on the heroic Kumbha; and the impetuous Kampana, in anger, challenged Angada and, forestalling him, struck him a violent blow causing him to reel. Thereafter that warrior, coming to himself, hurled a rock on his adversary, who, crushed under the blow, fell to the ground.", "Seeing Kampana slain, Shonitaksha drove his chariot boldly at the monkey and, in his fury, struck him with his sharp and fiery arrows, tearing his flesh; then, like unto the Fire of Death, he loosed innumerable flaming Kshuras, Kshurapras, Narachas, Vatsadantas, Shilimukhas, Karnis, Shalyas and Vipathas on him, and that valiant and energetic son of Bali, his limbs pierced, in his might, snapped the formidable bow of that titan and shattered his chariot with its shafts also.", "Thereupon Shonitaksha instantly took up his sword and shield and, without hesitation, sprang forward with an impetuous bound but the courageous Angada, receiving the violent impact, with a shout, broke that weapon with his hand. Thereafter that lion among monkeys, as if following the line of the sacred thread, let the blade fall on the titan\u2019s shoulder, cutting it in two and, raising his great sword, the son of Bali, shouting again and again, ran to the forefront of the battle to seek out further opponents.", "Now, in company with Prajangha, the courageous Yupaksha drove his car furiously against that valiant monkey and, at that instant, Shonitaksha, breathing heavily, rushed on that warrior of the golden bracelets? Full of energy, Prajangha, the intrepid companion of Yupaksha, hurled himself on the mighty Angada, mace in hand and, between Shonitaksha and Prajangha the Prince of Monkeys resembled the full moon between two Vishakhas. Then Mainda and Dvivida went to Angada\u2019s aid and stood on guard near him, whilst the titans of immense stature, their battalions drawn up, full of vigour, threw themselves furiously on the monkeys with swords, arrrows and maces and the encounter between those Indras among the monkeys, in the grip of those bulls of titans, was desperate, causing the hair to stand on end. In that fight, the former, seizing trees and stones, discharged them, but Prajangha, who was exceedingly powerful, broke them with his sword. Stones and trees fell thick and fast on his chariot but were all severed by the countless shafts of the mighty Yupaksha, while the trees that, on their side, were thrown by Dvivida and Mainda, were crushed and destroyed by Shonitaksha, who was full of ardour and courage.", "Thereafter the infuriated Prajangha, brandishing his great sword with which he severed the limbs of his adversaries, leapt on Angada and, seeing him close beside him, that Indra among the monkeys, in his great strength struck him a violent blow with an Ashvakarna Tree and, with his fist, hit out at the arm holding the sword which fell at the impact. Beholding his sword lying on the earth, like unto an iron bar, that powerful titan raised his fist and, like unto lightning, brought it down with great force on the brow of the intrepid Angada, foremost among the monkeys, who reeled for an instant but, having regained his senses, that courageous son of Bali, boiling with rage, struck Prajangha\u2019s head from his shoulders.", "Then Yupaksha, seeing his paternal uncle lying on the field, quickly alighted from his chariot, his eyes full of tears and, as his quiver was empty, drew his sword.", "Beholding Yupaksha rushing towards him thus, Dvivida, with a mighty blow, struck him on the breast and, in his ire, seized hold of him with force. Perceiving his valiant brother made captive, the exceedingly energetic Shonitaksha struck Dvivida on the chest, and the blow caused the intrepid Dvivida to stumble, but he clung to the mace that his rival sought once more to raise against him. Meanwhile Mainda joined Dvivida, and Shonitaksha and Yupaksha, burning with courage, engaged the two Plavagas in a terrible struggle. The mighty Dvivida tore the face of Shonitaksha with his nails and, dragging him to the ground, crushed him, whilst Mainda, fired with wrath, pressed Yupaksha in his arms so that he fell lifeless on the earth.", "Then the army of those foremost among the titans, discouraged by the death of their leaders, turned and fled in order to rejoin the sons of Kumbhakarna; and Kumbha, seeing those soldiers fleeing in all haste, rallied them and, perceiving those valiant warriors to have been cruelly used by the highly powerful monkeys, and their leaders being slain, Kumbha, full of ardour, began to execute difficult feats in the encounter.", "Taking up his bow, he, the foremost and most skilled of archers, let fly a series of arrows like unto venomous serpents able to pierce the limbs and, with his shafts and marvellous bow, shining with a great lustre he appeared like a second Indra illumined by the effulgence of Airavata! Thereafter he stretched that bow up to his ear and struck Dvivida with a golden-hafted and plumed arrow and, as soon as it pierced that foremost of the Plavagas, who resembled the Trikuta Mountain, his legs stiffened and, trembling, he stumbled and fell.", "Mainda, however, beholding his brother succumb in that great combat, rushed towards his adversary with a huge rock and that hero hurled it at the titan, but Kumbha shattered it with five whetted shafts and, taking hold of another dart with a sharp point, resembling a poisonous snake, he struck the breast of Dvivida\u2019s elder brother with violence.", "Under the blow, Mainda, the General of the Monkeys, his chest tom open, fell unconscious on the earth. Thereupon the fiery Angada, seeing his maternal uncles overcome despite their prowess, hurled himself on Kumbha who was stretching his bow and, as he advanced, Kumbha pierced him with five whetted darts, then with a further three, and again with three spears, as if he were attacking an elephant. Thus Angada was struck by the mighty Kumbha with innumerable shafts but, though his limbs were pierced by a succession of penetrating darts, that were flaming and adorned with gold, yet he remained immoveable and let fall a shower of rocks and trees on the head of that warrior born of Kumbhakarna, who cut off and severed all the weapons that the son of Bali loosed upon him.", "Seeing that leader of monkeys, Kumbha cut off his two eyelids with twin arrows, as one blinds an elephant with torches, so that the blood flowed and his eyes were veiled; thereupon Angada, with one hand protected his bloody lids and with the other seized hold of a Sala Tree that stood near and, propping it on his chest, he stripped that leafy tree of its branches, and, having bent it a little, discharged it in the fight in the sight of all the titans, and that Sala Tree, that resembled the banner of Indra, appeared like unto Mount Mandara. Thereafter Kumbha cut that tree to pieces and pierced his adversary with seven pointed and murderous shafts so that Angada suddenly fell down, unconscious.", "Beholding the invincible Angada stretched on the ground, like unto the sea when its waters recede, the leaders of the monkeys carried the tidings to Raghava. Then Rama, hearing that the son of Bali had fallen and been overcome in the course of a desperate struggle, issued his orders to the simian leaders who were led by Jambavan. At Rama\u2019s command, those lions among the monkeys, full of rage, their eyes red with anger, rushed on Kumbha, who was stretching his bow, and flew to the aid of Angada.", "Then Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshin, enraged, threw themselves on that warrior born of Kumbhakarna, and seeing them advance, the titan cut short the impetuous onslaught of those foremost of monkeys with a hail of arrows, as a rock obstructs the course of a torrent and, in the path sown with arrows, the intrepid monkeys were unable to discern anything, nor, as the sea cannot overstep its shores, were they able to pass.", "Beholding the simian ranks overwhelmed by the rain of shafts, the King of the Monkeys, Sugriva, placing his nephew, Angada, behind him, fell upon the son of Kumbhakarna in the fight, as an impetuous lion on an elephant who is wandering on the slopes of a mountain, and that powerful monkey tore up huge trees, Ashvakarnas and others of varying fragrance, in great numbers, which he hurled at his adversary. Then the illustrious son of Kumbhakarna, with his sharp arrows, shattered that irresistible avalanche of trees that covered the whole sky and scattered those forest giants that shone like Shataghnis.", "Beholding the rain of missiles dispersed by Kumbha, the valiant Monarch of the Monkeys, full of glory and majesty, remained unmoved and, suddenly struck by an arrow, he seized hold of Kumbha\u2019s bow that was equal to Indra\u2019s and broke it, throwing that weapon on the ground with violence. Then, having accomplished that incredible feat, he angrily addressed Kumbha, who resembled an elephant whose tusks are broken, and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Elder Brother of Nikumbha, your strength and prowess in loosing thine arrows are admirable as are your filial piety and courage and Ravana\u2019s also. O You who art equal to Prahlada or Bali or the Slayer of Vritra or Kuvera or Varuna, you alone art like unto your mighty Sire. You only, O Long-armed Warrior, armed with your mace, the slayer of your foes, cannot be overcome by the Gods any more than misfortune can overwhelm him who is master of his senses! Advance, O Most Intelligent Prince and witness me in action!", "\u201cOn account of a boon, your paternal uncle is able to withstand Devas and Danavas and, fiill of prowess, Kumbhakarna, in his turn, defied the Suras and Asuras 1 With your bow you are equal to Indra and in valour Ravana\u2019s peer! In the world you are now the foremost of the titans in strength and power! Let all beings witness the mighty and prodigious duel between us to-day resembling the combat between Shakra and Shambara! By striking down those valiant monkeys, who were possessed of extreme courage, you have accomplished a feat without equal and manifested your skill in the use of weapons. O Hero, it is from fear of incurring reproach that I have not slain you, for your great exploits have wearied you; rest awhile therefore, reflecting on my prowess!\u201d", "Thus flattered by Sugriva with fair words, the ardour of that warrior was redoubled, as the sacred fire flames up when butter is poured therein. Then Kumbha seized Sugriva in his two arms, whereupon, like two elephants intoxicated with ichor, those two, breathing heavily again and again, their limbs interlaced, crushed each other, wrestling, and from their mouths emitting flames mingled with smoke. Under the trampling of their feet, the earth sank and the waters of Varuna\u2019s abode, overflowed on every side.", "Finally Sugriva, having thrown Kumbha down with violence, cast him into the salty waves, thus causing him to become acquainted with the depths of the ocean. Nevertheless Kumbha rose again and leapt on Sugriva, with his fist delivering a furious blow like unto lightning upon his breast, and the armour of the monkey was shattered and blood gushed forth. That violent blow from the titan\u2019s fist struck against the bones of his adversary and, from the impact, a flame shot forth resembling the fire that bursts from the Mountain Meru when struck by lightning. Thereafter Sugriva, that mighty lion among the monkeys, effulgent like the solar disc of a thousand rays, parrying the thrust, lifted up a fist resembling a thunderbolt and brought it down with force on his opponent\u2019s breast. At the impact, which shattered him, Kumbha, bereft of his senses, sank like a brazier, the brightness of which is extinguished. Under this blow of the fist, the titan suddenly fell down, like unto the Lohitanga of brilliant rays expelled from heaven by the force of destiny. And Kumbha falling, his chest crushed by Sugriva, resembled the flaming body of a meteor shooting from the sky!", "Thereupon Kumbha being struck down in the fight by that Monarch of the Plavamgamas of formidable valour, the earth with its mountains and forests trembled and a great fear seized the titans.", "Nikumbha, seeing his brother slain by Sugriva, gazed on the King of the Monkeys as if he would consume him with the fury of his glance, and that warrior took hold of his brilliant and terrible mace as large as the peak of the Mahendra Mountain, like unto the Rod of Death, the support of the titans, which was festooned with garlands, plated with gold and embellished with diamonds and coral.", "Brandishing that weapon of a splendour equal to Indra\u2019s standard, the fortunate Nikumbha, who was endowed with redoubtable courage, opening his mouth wide, emitted loud cries. With his breast adorned with golden pieces, his arms encircled with bracelets, his charming earrings and graceful garlands, his jewels and his mace, Nikumbha shone like a cloud shot with lightning and charged with thunder to which the bow of Indra is added. The tip of his weapon shattered the conjunction of the seven winds and that loud-voiced hero glowed like a smokeless flame, whereupon the firmament with the City of Vitapavati, the most lovely palaces of the Gandharvas, the clusters of stars and planets, the moon and great luminaries seemed to be spinning round with the whirling of Nikumbha\u2019s mace! Unapproachable in ardour, Nikumbha was like unto the Fire at the destruction of the worlds, his mace and his ornaments the flames, his wrath the fuel, and, in their terror, neither titans nor monkeys dared to move.", "Hanuman, however, baring his breast, stood fearlessly before him, and that titan, with arms as thick as iron bars which shone like the star of day, brought his weapon down on the breast of that mighty one so that it broke into a hundred pieces like a meteor suddenly exploding in space. But the great monkey remained unmoved under the impact of that weapon like a mountain in an earthquake. Thus assailed by his adversary, Hanuman, the foremost of the Plavagas, swinging his fist round with extreme force and lifting it up, with a swift bound struck Nikumbha a violent blow on the chest so that his armour was shattered and blood shot forth like lightning from a cloud.", "The shock caused Nikumbha to stumble but, steadying himself, he seized hold of the energetic Hanuman, whereupon a great cheering broke out amongst the inhabitants of Lanka, witnessing that combat.", "Though lifted up in this wise by the titan, the mighty Hanuman struck him a violent blow with his fist and, freeing himself from Nikumbha\u2019s grasp, leapt to the ground, thereafter, with a supreme effort, in his rage he struck him down, crushing him and then, leaping into the air, he fell heavily on his chest and taking hold of his neck, pressed it with his two hands while he cried out, whereupon he tore off his head which was of an appalling size.", "Amidst the shrieks emitted by Nikumbha, who had fallen under the blows of the son of Pavana, the armies of the son of Dasaratha and the son of that Indra of the Titans, both filled with fury, entered into a desperate struggle. And Nikumbha being slain, the Plavagas emitted cries of joy that re-echoed in all the quarters of the horizon and the earth seemed to tremble and the heavens crumble, whilst the hosts of the titans were filled with terror.", "Seeing Nikumbha slain and Kumbha also laid low, Ravana, in extreme wrath, appeared like unto a raging fire, and that Nairrita, mad with anger and grief, spoke with urgency to the son of Khara, the large-eyed Maharaksha, saying:\u2014", "\u201cGo, O My Son, and, at my command, strike down Raghava and Lakshmana with all the dwellers in the woods.\u201d", "On this behest, the son of Khara, Maharaksha, who was proud of his courage, answered:\u2014", "\u201cIt is well! I shall obey you!\u201d Thereafter, having paid obeisance to Ravana by circumambulating him, that valiant warrior emerged from his sumptuous abode. Then Khara\u2019s son addressed the commander of the army, who stood near, saying:\u2014", "\u201cLet my chariot be brought hither immediately and assemble the troops at the earliest moment!\u201d", "On this, that night-ranger brought his chariot and assembled the army, whereupon Maharaksha, having paid obeisance to the car and circumambulated it, caused it to be driven forward urging on his charioteer with the words: \u2018Drive on!\u2019.", "Thereafter Maharaksha issued this order to all the titans:\u2014", "\u201cDo you precede me, O Soldiers! As for myself, the magnanimous Ravana has commanded me to slay those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, in combat! Today I shall lay them low with my whetted shafts, O Night Rangers, as also the deer of the trees and Sugriva. Today, under the blows of my mace, the great host of monkeys will be destroyed as dry wood by fire!\u2019.", "Hearing Maharaksha\u2019s words, the rangers of the night, furnished with all sorts of weapons, full of valour, dosed their ranks. Able to change their shape at will, ferocious, endowed with sharp claws, their eyes inflamed, emitting the roar of elephants, causing the hair to stand on end, inspiring terror, those giants surrounded the huge son of Khara, shouting joyfully, shattering the vault of heaven. Then conches and drums sounded by thousands in all the quarters whilst they, leaping and clapping their hands, caused a great tumult.", "Thereafter Maharaksha\u2019s charioteer suddenly let the goad drop from his hand, and the standard fell to the ground, whilst the horses, harnessed to his chariot, slackened their pace and stumbled as they advanced, mournfully shedding tears, and, as the illustrious Maharaksha set forth, a sinister and biting dust storm arose.", "Nevertheless the titans, having witnessed those portents, set out unheeding and full of courage to meet Rama and Lakshmana and their hue was like unto herds of elephants or buffalo and they bore the marks of the blows from maces and swords received in the forefront of battle.", "\u201cHere stand I! Here stand I!\u201d cried those seasoned warriors beginning to range to and fro on the battlefield.", "Seeing Maharaksha approach, the foremost among the monkeys rushed forward burning to fight. Thereupon a desperate struggle ensued between the rangers of the night and the Plavagas, like unto that combat formerly waged between Devas and Danavas, causing the hair to stand on end.", "Blows from trees and swords, clashes of maces and iron bars were exchanged, whilst monkeys and night-rangers assailed each other and the titans created carnage among the foremost of the monkeys with swords, maces, lances, javelins, harpoons, goads and arrows, nets, hammers, sticks and other weapons with which they struck out on every side.", "Overwhelmed by a mass of missiles which the son of Khara hurled upon them, all the monkeys, distracted, fled full of terror and, seeing their enemies routed, the titans emitted leonine roars and triumphant shouts, while the monkeys scattered in all directions. Then Rama covered the titans with a hail of arrows and, beholding them overpowered in this wise, Maharaksha, that ranger of the night, consumed with the fire of his wrath, challenged Rama in these words, saying:\u2014", "\u201cStay! It is with me, O Rama, that you should measure your strength! With whetted shafts loosed from my bow, I am about to relieve you of your life! Since, in the Forest of Dandaka, you didst slay my sire, remembering thine iniquity, my wrath has increased! O Wicked Raghava, a violent fire consumes my limbs since I failed to meet with you in that great forest! By good fortune you are now before me; as a hungry lion desires to see its prey, so did I seek this encounter! Soon shall my swift arrows despatch you to the region of the dead where you shalt rejoin the warriors you have slain! Of what use are further words? O Rama, let all the worlds witness our combat; let us fight with darts, maces, fists or whatever weapon you preferest!\u201d", "Thus spoke Maharaksha and the son of Dasaratha, smiling, interrupted that flow of words, saying:\u2014\u201cO Titan, of what use is this prating? It is in no wise worthy of you! On the battlefield one does not triumph by strength of words but by fighting! Fourteen thousand titans and your sire, Trishiras and Dushana himself, fell under my blows in the Dandaka Forest! Today vultures, jackals and crows shall feed on your flesh with their beaks, nails and claws, O Wretch!\u201d", "Hearing these words of Raghava\u2019s, Maharaksha loosed innumerable shafts on him with great violence, but Rama, with a shower of darts, severed those golden-hafted and richly bejewelled arrows again and again so that they fell in pieces on the earth. Thereafter, as they joined issue, a desperate struggle ensued between the son of the demon, Khara, and the son of Dasaratha, and the clanging of their bow-strings and the dash of their gauntlets was like the muttering of thunderclouds.", "Then Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Kinneras and great Serpents stood in the sky eager to witness that prodigious conflict. Each wound inflicted on the combatants redoubled their ardour as they exchanged blow for blow, and the countless shafts loosed by Rama were destroyed by the titan whilst those of the titan were severed by Rama again and again.", "Innumerable missiles covered all the regions and space itself and the earth was heaped on every side so that it could not be distinguished. Finally the long-armed Raghava, enraged, broke the bow of his adversary and with eight Narachas wounded his charioteer; with his shafts he demolished the chariot and slew the horses who fell to the ground.", "Deprived of his car, Maharaksha, that prowler of the night, stood on the ground and, armed with his spear, he shone like Fire at the dissolution of the worlds; and he was irresistible with his great lance, a gift from Shiva, that glittered in the air like unto the weapon of destruction.", "Beholding that great spear that emitted flames, the Gods, struck with terror fled on all sides whilst that ranger of the night, lifting it up, hurled it with fury against the magnanimous Raghava. As it fell flaming from the hand of the son of Khara, Raghava, with four arrows, severed it in its flight and, broken at many points, that spear with its celestial gilding, having been destroyed by Rama\u2019s shafts, fell to earth like a great meteor.", "Beholding that weapon shattered by Rama of imperishable exploits, the Bhutas cried out in the sky:\u2014\u201cWell done! Well done!\u201dand observing his spear to be broken, Maharaksha, that, ranger of the night, raising his fist, called out to Kakutstha, \u201cStay! Stay!\u201d", "Seeing him advancing, Rama, the joy of the House of Raghu, smiling disdainfully, took the Fire-weapon from his quiver whereupon, struck by Kakutstha\u2019s shaft, the titan, his heart transfixed, fell down and perished.", "Witnessing the fall of Maharaksha, all the titans, terrified of Rama\u2019s arrows, fled to Lanka. Thereafter the Gods rejoiced at the death of that night ranger, born of Khara, who had been stricken by the violent blows of Dasarathi and shattered like a mountain struck by lightning.", "Hearing of the death of Maharaksha, Ravana, hitherto victorious in war, became a prey to violent anger, grinding his teeth and, enraged, he reflected on what ought to be done. Having considered the matter, in his wrath he sent his son, Indrajita, out to fight, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHaving triumphed over those two powerful brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, return, O Hero! Visible or invisible, you are superior in every way. Were you not victorious in the struggle with Indra of incomparable exploits, therefore why should you not succeed with these two mortals?\u201d", "At this command of the King of the Titans, Indrajita, in obedience, proceeded to the place of sacrifice to offer oblations to Pavaka according to the traditional rites. During the ceremony female titans carrying red turbans also came there and took part in sacrificing to the fire. Thereafter titans came up hurriedly to that place where Ravani was, and, in that sacrifice, weapons such as Sharapatras, Bibhitakas, with fuel, red robes and iron ladles were placed there, then, having heaped the fire with Sharapatras and Tomaras, Indrajita seized hold of a living black buck by the neck. And that smokeless brazier devoured the sacred grass, oblations and fuel, whereupon many auspicious omens, indicative of victory, appeared. With its flames, bright as the moon, whirling in a southerly direction, the fire, having been kindled, seized hold of the offerings.", "Thereafter, having offered oblations to Agni and gratified the Devas, Danavas and Demons, Indrajita ascended his marvellous car which he had rendered invisible. In his magnificent vehicle harnessed to four horses, that hero, furnished with whetted shafts and armed with his great bow, appeared resplendent. The chariot with its decorations of refined gold, carved with figures of gazelles, moons and crescents shone with beauty; and Indrajita possessed a standard that, with its golden rings and encrustations of emerald, glowed like a brazier.", "Under the protection of the Rod of Brahma, like unto the sun, the mighty Ravani was invincible. Setting out from the city, having invoked Agni and acquired the power to make himself invisible by the aid of sacred formulas lawful to titans, the triumphant Indrajita spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cToday I shall slay those two who have passed their exile in the forest in vain and, in combat, win a decisive victory for my Sire, Ravana. Today, having destroyed Rama and Lakshmana, I shall enjoy the supreme felicity of ridding the earth of monkeys!\u201d", "Having spoken thus, he made himself invisible and thereafter rushed furiously into the fray, whither Ravana had despatched him. Effulgent, with bow and shafts, that ardent adversary of Indra, beholding those two valiant heroes like unto a serpent with three heads, who were loosing a stream of arrows in the midst of the monkeys, reflected:\u2014\u2018These are those two!\u2019 and stretching his bow he covered those warriors with a shower of darts, as Parjanya lets loose his rain. Standing in his aerial car, invisible to the eye, he overwhelmed Rama and Lakshmana with whetted shafts.", "Enveloped by those swift darts, Rama and Lakshmana placed celestial arrows on their bows and those two valiant warriors covered the sky with a rain of missiles as bright as the sun, without striking Indrajita.", "Thereupon that powerful titan filled the sky with darkness and smoke, blotting out the cardinal points and shrouding himself in a dense fog; and, during his airy flight, neither the twanging of his bow-string nor the sound of the wheels nor the clattering of the horses\u2019 hoofs could be heard nor could he himself be seen.", "In the midst of that fearful darkness, that long-armed warrior loosed a shower of Narachas so that it appeared like an avalanche of rocks and, with his golden shafts, bestowed on him as a boon, the furious Ravani wounded Rama and Lakshmana grievously in every limb.", "Then those two lions among men, overcome by Narachas, like unto mountains under a deluge, loosed their whetted and golden-hafted arrows and those darts, adorned with heron\u2019s plumes, struck the son of Ravana in the sky and pierced him in his course, whereupon they fell on the earth covered with blood. Thereafter, those two princes, with the aid of innumerable shafts, sought to sever the mass of missiles in their flight that burned them cruelly, and the two sons of Dasaratha aimed their excellent shafts in the direction whence those whetted darts fell. Ravani, however, a skilled driver, coursing on every side in his chariot, struck the two sons of Dasaratha with swift arrows and sharp shafts. Riddled by the golden-hafted arrows that rained upon them incessantly, the two sons of Dasaratha appeared like Kimshuka Trees in flower.", "None could follow the rapidity of the titan\u2019s course; none catch a glimpse of him nor his chariot nor his arrows so that he resembled the sun obscured by heavy cloud.", "Struck down, wounded and slain by him, the monkeys lay stretched on the earth in hundreds, whereupon Lakshmana, enraged, addressed his brother, saying:\u2014", "\u201cShall I loose the Brahma Weapon in order to exterminate all the titans?\u201d But Rama, who bore the marks of royalty, answered him:\u2014", "\u201cNay, it does not behove you to rid the earth of titans! No one may strike him who has withdrawn from the fight, or who has sought protection or has hidden himself or stands before you with joined palms or who is fleeing or intoxicated! O Long-armed Hero, we will strive to slay Indrajita by employing those exceedingly fiery arrows resembling serpents. That magician, that insignificant titan with his invisible chariot will be overthrown by the monkey leaders should he reveal himself. Whether he penetrate heaven or hell or range the firmament, my shafts will consume him wheresoever he may take refuge and he will fall, deprived of life!\u201d", "Having spoken these significant words, that hero of the House of Raghu, who was surrounded by the Plavagas, in his great might, reflected on how he should destroy that barbarian, the perpetrator of evil deeds.", "Indrajita, having divined the mighty Raghava\u2019s intention, withdrew from the fight in order to re-enter the city. Thereafter, remembering the death of those brave titans, his eyes red with anger, the valiant Ravani set forth once more, leaving by the western gate surrounded by titans; and the extremely energetic Indrajita, the descendant of Paulastya, that thorn in the side of the Gods, seeing those warriors, the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana burning to fight, resorted to magic and caused the illusory figure of Sita to appear in the chariot encircled by a large force and he made seeming preparations to slay her.", "For the purpose of deceiving the monkeys, that wretch conceived this design and, advancing to meet them, resolved to slay Sita as it were. Then the monkeys, beholding him approaching, enraged, rushed upon him with rocks in their hands, burning to fight. At their head marched Hanuman, that elephant among monkeys, armed with an enormous mountain peak. And he beheld in the chariot of Indrajita the unfortunate Sita, with a single tress, sorrowful, her features wasted on account of fasting; and the beloved of Raghava wore only a soiled garment nor had she washed her countenance and the limbs of that lovely woman were covered with dust and mud.", "Seeing Maithili, Hanuman stood a moment as if stupefied, for, but a little while since, he had beheld the daughter of Janaka and, at the sight of that unfortunate being standing sorrowfully in the car, under the sway of that Indra of Titans, Hanuman thought to himself \u2018What does this titan intend to do?\u2019 Having reflected thus, that great monkey, the foremost of the Plavagas, rushed forward to meet Ravani.", "Beholding that simian army, the son of Ravana, transported with rage, drew his sword from its sheath and brandished it over Sita\u2019s head in their presence, and he struck that woman in the chariot, who was created by illusion, whilst she cried out, \u201cO Rama, O Rama 1\u201d Then Hanuman, born of Maruta, seeing the titan seize her by her attire, became greatly afflicted and tears of grief fell from his eyes as he beheld the cherished consort of Rama, who was so divinely beautiful. Thereafter, in his anger, he addressed the son of the King of the Titans harshly, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Wretch, it is to your destruction that you have laid hands on her hair! O Offspring of a family of Brahmarishis, you have fallen into the womb of a female demon. Cursed art you for thine infamous conduct in cherishing such a desire! Cruel and ruthless scoundrel, vile and puerile warrior, art you not ashamed to perpetrate such an infamous deed? O Pitiless One, without a heart, what has Maithili done, torn as she is from her home, her kingdom and the arms of Rama, that you should seek to slay her without mercy? Sita being slain, you shalt undoubtedly not survive long, since, deserving death for such a crime, you have fallen into my hands! When you have yielded up your life\u2019s breath, your fate will be the lowest hell to which the slayers of women descend and which is eschewed by the most infamous of evil-doers!\u201d", "Speaking thus, Hanuman, attended by armed monkeys, hurled himself in fury on the son of that Indra of Titans who opposed the powerful army of monkeys that surged towards him with his titans of redoubtable ferocity. And he himself assailed that simian host with thousands of arrows and thereafter addressed Hanuman, that monkey leader, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI am about to slay Vaidehi before your eyes, who is the cause of Sugriva, you and Rama, coming hither! She being slain, I shall destroy Rama, Lakshmana, you thyself, O Monkey, and Sugriva, as also the vile Bibishana. You have said \u2018One must not slay a woman\u2019, O Plavagama, but assuredly one is justified in doing that which will injure a foe 1\u201d", "Speaking thus, with his sword furnished with a sharp blade, he struck Sita, that illusory phantom, who was sobbing and, having slain her, Indrajita said to Hanuman:\u2014", "\u201cBehold how the beloved of Rama has fallen under my sword! Vaidehi is dead, thine arduous undertaking has been in vain!\u201d", "Having thus slain her with his great sword, Indrajita, full of joy, standing in his chariot, began to shout aloud, and the monkeys, ranged before him at no great distance, heard him roaring full throatedly, stationed in his aerial citadel.", "Having slain the illusory Sita, the perfidious Ravani manifested great delight and, beholding him fully satisfied, the monkeys, a prey to despair, took to flight.", "Hearing that formidable clamour and beholding Ravani, whose voice resembled Indra\u2019s thunder, the monkeys immediately fled in all directions.", "Then Hanuman, born of Maruta, called to those who, with a downcast mien, sorrowful and fearful, were fleeing on all sides and said:\u2014", "\u201cWhy are you fleeing with a cheerless mien in all directions, O Plavamgamas? Where is your courage? Do not turn your back on the foe but follow me into battle!\u201d", "At this reprimand from the virtuous son of Vayu, the monkeys, re-assured, armed with rocks and trees, advanced and, in a transport of fury, challenged the titans. Thereafter those lions among the monkeys encircled Hanuman who accompanied them in the great fight and, as the Consumer of Offerings bums up the east with his rays, so did Hanuman, surrounded on all aides by the foremost of monkeys, consume the enemy host. Creating carnage among the titans, that most powerful monkey, attended by the simian battalions, resembled Yama on the day of the final dissolution and, smarting with grief and anger, Hanuman hurled a huge rock on Ravani\u2019s chariot.", "Seeing that missile descending, the driver, master of his horses, turned his car aside so that neither Indrajita nor the charioteer were struck by that rock which split the earth, burying itself after a fruitless flight.", "Then those inhabitants of the woods, shouting, rushed on the enemy in their hundreds and those giants brandished trees and mountain peaks so that Indrajita was covered by a fearful hail of trees and stones by those Plavamgamas of redoutable valour. And they created havoc in the ranks of the enemy causing a great tumult and, under the ferocious blows of those terrible monkeys, the hideous rangers of the night fell, overwhelmed by trees on the battlefield.", "Beholding his forces thus roughly handled by the monkeys, Indrajita, enraged, surrounded by his divisions, advanced towards them loosing a quantity of arrows and that intrepid warrior struck down the foremost of the monkeys in great numbers.", "Furnished with spears, rocks, swords, harpoons, picks and maces, the monkeys, on their side, annihilated his companions in the struggle, and the exceedingly valiant Hanuman made use of huge trunks and branches of trees, stones and rocks to exterminate those titans of terrible exploits.", "Having thrown back the enemy forces, Hanuman said to his troops:\u2014\u201cWe have acted in order to please Rama at the risk of our lives but she, for whom we have fought, the daughter of Janaka, is dead! Having informed Rama and Sugriva of this on our return, we will do whatever they command\u201d.", "Thus spoke that monkey general and heroically calling in his troops, he returned slowly with them.", "Meanwhile, seeing Hanuman going to rejoin Raghava, the wicked Indrajita, desiring to offer oblations, went to the sacrificial altar of Nikumbhila and, reaching that place, he invoked the God of Fire, Pavaka. Having entered the place of sacrifice at the instance of the titans, Indrajita began to pour on the libations, and the fire blazed up, consuming the oblations and blood, and Agni, effulgent, sparkling and satisfied, resembled the setting sun.", "Thereafter Indrajita poured libations on the earth for the prosperity of the titans, according to the rites in which he was well versed and, beholding this, the titans, instructed in what was fitting and unfitting, stood round in great numbers.", "Meanwhile in that fight between the titans and the monkeys, Raghava, hearing the formidable tumult, said to Jambavan:\u2014", "\u201cO Friend, to judge by the fearful uproar and the clamour of the combatants, Hanuman is performing an exceedingly difficult feat at this moment. Go, attended by thine army, O Leader of the Bears, and lend thine aid to that Prince of Monkeys who is engaged in combat!\u201d", "\u201cBe it so!\u201d said the King of the Bears, and thereafter, surrounded by his troops, he advanced to the western gate to join Hanuman and that Lord of the Bears beheld Hanuman returning amidst his monkeys who had given up the fight and were lamenting. Beholding the host of bears, resembling a dark and fearful cloud, Hanuman caused them to halt and retrace their steps. Then that illustrious warrior, in company with those troops, speedily returned to seek out Rama and, full of grief, addressed him saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhilst we were fighting, under our very eyes, Indrajita, born of Ravana, slew Sita who was weeping, O Destroyer of your Foes and, my mind being afflicted by this spectacle, in despair I have come to inform you of what has taken place!\u201d", "Hearing these tidings, Raghava, overcome with sorrow, fell to the earth like a tree whose roots have been severed and, beholding the son of Raghu, who was like a God, lying on the ground, the monkey leaders from all sides rushed towards him as he lay consumed with the violence of his grief, resembling a fire that has suddenly been ignited; and they sprinkled him with water that was fragrant with the scent of blue and white lotuses.", "Then Lakshmana, full of anguish, pressed him in his arms and addressed the half-conscious Rama, in words pregnant with reason and penetration, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO You who walkest in the path of virtue, O My Noble Brother, though you have mastered your senses yet righteousness", "has not been able to preserve you from misfortune! I see the form of that which is animate and inanimate but not the form of dharma, hence in mine opinion, it does not exist! Inanimate objects may be seen and also those which are animate but the spiritual law is not manifest, else the virtuous such as you would not suffer adversity! If unrighteousness brought evil in its train, then Ravana would now be in hell and you, who art virtuous, wouldst not be afflicted by ill-fortune. Meanwhile calamity spares the titan in order to strike you down, which proves the consequences of righteousness and unrighteousness to be reversed! If virtue produced good results and unrighteousness evil ones, then those (like Ravana), who have forsaken virtue, would suffer evil consequences. Those who never take pleasure in ill-doing should not be robbed of felicity since their every delight is in doing good; those who follow righteousness should pluck the fruits thereof. Since prosperity attends on those in whom unrighteousness abides and those, who make virtue their way of life, are afflicted, these words (vice and virtue) have no meaning! O Raghava, if the evil-doer perished through his own unrighteousness, unrighteousness itself would perish through its own evil and, it being destroyed, how could it destroy? If it be through the decree of destiny that a man is slain or slays another, then it is destiny and not the slayer who is at fault. O You, Slayer of your Foes, since one is unable to discern the law of dharma meting out retribution or behold its form and it is as if it were not, how is it possible to attain the highest by means of dharma? If dharma truly existed, O King, O Most Virtuous of Men, then you wouldst not have suffered this misfortune; it is therefore manifest that this law is meaningless 1 Dharma, being weak and powerless, attaches itself to the strong and, because of its weakness, rubs out any difference between itself and vice, therefore, in mine opinion, one should disregard it. If unrighteousness is merely the result of strength, then abandon it since might is right. But if, as some hold, dharma is loyalty to one\u2019s word, O Scourge of your Foes, then your sire is guilty of adharma in the duplicity and cruelty he meted out to you without reason! If one accepts the existence of righteousness, then Indra, the Bearer of the Thunderbolt, God of a Hundred Sacrifices, was not justified in performing a sacrifice after slaying the Ascetic Vishvarupa. If righteousness gives birth to unrighteousness, it must perish, O Raghava! Men will act accordingly to their whim, O Kakutstha. In mine opinion, O beloved Raghava, dharma has indeed been destroyed; you have severed its roots by abandoning your kingdom! Like streams from the mountains, all success is brought to birth by material prosperity. The man of small intelligence, without resources, sees all his deeds come to nought as trickles of water drying up in the hot season. Renouncing wealth when one is accustomed to the advantages in which one is reared, is an error of judgment and is setting out on the wrong path. He who has wealth has friends and kinsfolk; he who has wealth is verily a man of importance; he who has wealth is a wise man. The wealthy man is brave, the wealthy man is wise, the wealthy man is powerful, above all the wealthy man is a man of worth! O Hero, I have pointed out the disadvantages that result from giving up one\u2019s good fortune, I see no reason for your determination to abandon the crown.", "\u201cHe who possesses a fortune finds virtue, pleasure and prosperity to be at his disposal; the poor man who seeks wealth, cannot attain it and merely dreams of it. Wealth is the creator of joy, pleasure, pride, anger, and inner and outer control; all these come from wealth, O Foremost of Men 1 Prosperity eludes virtuous men and those who pursue the path of duty in this world, nor can it be discerned any more than the stars in a stormy sky! Whilst, in accordance with your sire\u2019s command, you didst live in exile, O Hero, a titan bore away your consort who is dearer to you than life itself.", "\u201cO Hero, by my valour I shall be able to dissipate this great grief that Indrajita has caused you to-day, O Raghava, arise therefore, rise up, O Lion among Men, O Long-armed Warrior, who art fixed in your vows! Dost you not know that you are the Self, the Highest Self?", "\u201cHere am I, O Irreproachable Hero, at your command! The tidings of the death of the daughter of Janaka enrages me! With my shafts I shall overwhelm Lanka, its chariots, horses, titans and its king.\u201d", "Whilst Lakshmana, in bis fraternal affection, was consoling Rama, Bibishana, who had been restoring order in the ranks, came to that place.", "Four warriors, armed with various weapons, escorted him and they resembled heaps of black collyrium and were like unto the leaders of elephant herds. Then that hero approaching, beheld Raghava plunged in affliction, as also the monkeys themselves, whose eyes were full of tears, and he saw the great-souled Raghava, the joy of the Ikshvaku Race, stunned with burning grief, whereupon Bibishana, his heart pierced with anguish, enquired:\u2014\u2022\u201cHow is this?\u201d", "Then Lakshmana, seeing Bibishana, Sugriva and the monkeys, uttered these impetuous words:\u2014", "\u201cIndrajita has slain Sita! Hearing these tidings from Hanuman\u2019s lips, Raghava has been overwhelmed with despair, O My Friend!\u201d", "As Saumitri was still speaking, Bibishana interrupted him and addressed Rama, whose mind was agitated, in words fraught with good sense, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Indra among Men, that which you have heard spoken by Hanuman with a sorrowful mien, seems to me as probable as the drying up of the sea! I am fully conversant with the wicked Ravana\u2019s design; assuredly he would never permit Sita to be ill-treated, O Long-armed Warrior! Though constantly pressed by me, who desired his welfare, to release Vaidehi, he would never listen to me. Neither by persuasion nor threats, conciliation nor gifts nor by sowing dissension, has anyone been able to behold Sita, how much less by force of arms? It was in order to deceive the monkeys that Indrajita set out to meet them again; this seeming daughter of Janaka is the effect of illusion, O Long-armed Warrior.", "\u201cTo-day Indrajita is going to the sacrificial ground of Nikumbhila to offer an oblation. Having performed the sacrifice, on leaving, the son of Ravana will be invincible in battle even to the Gods led by Vasava. It is he, in the role of a skilled magician, who has made use of this illusion in order to undermine the courage of the monkeys. Let us leave now with our forces ere he accomplishes his object. Shake off the distress that has visited you on this account, O Lion among Men! The whole army is dispirited on beholding the grief that overwhelms you. Come, pluck up courage, rise, call up your valour and command Lakshmana to join with us and the troops which we command.", "\u201cWith his whetted shafts, that lion among men will compel Ravani to break off his sacrifice, after which he may be slain. Your brother\u2019s sharp and penetrating arrows, that fly on wings and resemble birds of prey, will drink his blood. O Long-armed Warrior, let Lakshmana, who is endowed with auspicious marks, bear down on that titan in order to destroy him, as Indra looses his thunderbolt. O Best of Men, it is not fitting to defer the slaying of a foe; now suffer Lakshmana to fall on thine adversary speedily in order to slay him, as Mahadeva looses his thunderbolt on the enemies of the Gods in order to exterminate them.\u201d", "Thus did the titan speak, but Raghava, who was overwhelmed with grief, did not fully comprehend what was said to him. Thereafter, having regained his strength, Rama, the Conqueror of Hostile Citadels, answered Bibishana, who was seated at his side, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Bibishana, Prince of the Nairritas, I desire to hear once more what you have said to me; do you repeat what I long to know.\u201d", "Hearing these words of Raghava, Bibishana, skilled in discourse, repeated that which he had already told him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThe behests you didst lay upon me, O Long-armed Warrior, regarding the disposal of the forces, have been carried out scrupulously; the divisions of the army are drawn up on all sides and the leaders have each had their posts allotted to them. O Mighty Lord, now hear what I have to impart further.", "\u201cO Prince, beholding you afflicted, we are discouraged; abandon your distress, that grief which conduces to the joy of the foe afar off! Take courage, O Hero, and destroy the rangers of the night! May felicity be thine, since you are to be re-united with Sita! O Joy of the House of Raghu, listen to my sage counsel! Let Saumitri set out bravely at the head of a considerable force and converge on the Nikumbhila Grove, in order to slay Ravani in combat by the aid of arrows, resembling venomous snakes, loosed from his bow!", "\u201cThat warrior, on account of his asceticism received a marvellous boon, the Brahmashira Weapon, from Svyambhu and also steeds that course at his will; he has undoubtedly reached the Nikumbhila Grove with his forces! If he succeeds in carrying through the sacrifice, know that we are lost!", "\u201c\u2018The foe who strikes you ere you have reached the Nikumbhila Grove and ignited the fire, armed as you are, will bring about your death, O Enemy of Indra!\u2019 Such were the words pronounced by the Lord of the World and thus was the end of that crafty titan ordained! O Rama, send your powerful brother to slay Indrajita and, he being slain, Ravana with his friends is also slain!\u201d", "Bibishana having spoken thus, Rama answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201cO You, whose prowess is truth, I know the magic power of that barbarian; his knowledge of the Brahma Weapon endows that skilful and great magician with immense power so that he is able to deprive the Gods and Varuna himself of consciousness in combat! While he ranges the sky in his chariot, O Illustrious Prince, one is no more able to follow his course than that of the sun in the midst of heavy cloud!\u201d", "Then Raghava, who was conversant with the magic power of that crafty foe, said to Lakshmana who shone with effulgence:\u2014", "\u201cGo with the entire army of the Lord of the Monkeys with its generals and Hanuman at their head, O Lakshmana; take the army of the bears with their leader Jambavan, and destroy the titan possessed of the power of magic. This magnanimous night-ranger will follow you with his ministers in order that you mayest fall upon that master of illusion.\u201d", "Hearing these words of Raghava, Lakshmana of redoubtable courage, who was accompanied by Bibishana, took up his rare bow, the foremost of all, and donning his mail, furnished with a sword and arrows, and full of joy, addressed him thus:\u2014", "\u201cTo-day the arrows loosed from my bow, having pierced Ravani, will lay Lanka waste as herons ravage a lotus pool! This very day the shafts speeding from my bow will pierce the body of that barbarian!\u201d", "Having spoken thus to his brother, the illustrious Lakshmana, eager to slay Ravani, departed with all speed and, having paid obeisance to the feet of his elder brother and circumambulated him, he set out for the Nikumbhila Grove, the place of sacrifice, where Ravani was to be found. Followed by Bibishana, Prince Lakshmana, burning with courage, with the good wishes of his brother, hastened away. Then Hanuman, at the head of countless monkeys and Bibishana with his counsellors speedily followed in his wake.", "Whilst the great hosts of monkeys threw themselves in his train, Lakshmana beheld the forces of the King of the Bears stationed in the way. Thereafter Sumitra\u2019s son, the joy of his friends, having already covered a great distance, observed the army of the King of the Titans ranged for battle and, bow in hand, that conqueror of his foes, the joy of the House of Raghu, coming upon that skilful magician, prepared to enter into combat with him in conformity with Brahma\u2019s ordinance, and that prince, who was full of ardour, was accompanied by Bibishana, the valiant Angada and also the son of Anila.", "Thereafter Lakshmana, as one entering into darkness, penetrated into the ranks of the countless enemy host that was exceedingly formidable, blazing with its glittering weapons and shaded by its dense rows of mighty chariots with their standards.", "As these events were taking place, the younger brother of Ravana gave the following counsel to Lakshmana, which was advantageous to his undertaking but detrimental to his foes, saying:\u2014", "\u201cArmed with rocks, throw thyself with your monkeys on the army of the titan which is now visible and resembles a dark cloud. Seek to overthrow them, O Lakshmana, for the son of that Indra of the Titans will become visible the instant the ranks are broken. With thine arrows, that equal Indra\u2019s thunderbolt, assail the enemy; enter into the fray with all speed ere the sacrifice be completed. O Warrior, triumph over that perverse but skilled magician, the wicked Ravani of ruthless exploits, the terror of the worlds!\u201d", "At these words of Bibishana, Lakshmana, endowed with auspicious marks, let loose a rain of shafts on the son of the Lord of the Titans. Thereafter the bears and monkeys in a body, arming themselves with huge trees, rushed on the army of the titans which was drawn up in battle array and which, with sharp darts, swords, picks and spears hurled itself on the simian battalions eager to overcome them.", "Thereupon a desperate struggle ensued between monkeys and titans and the city re-echoed with the mighty tumult. Missiles of every kind, whetted darts, trees and mountain peaks sped through the air in dreadful wise so that the sky was obscured and innumerable titans, possessed of monstrous arms and faces, hurled their weapons on the foremost of the monkeys, creating extreme tenor amongst them, whilst, from their side, the monkeys struck the titans with whole trees and crags, crushing them in the struggle. And the foremost of the bears and monkeys, of immense stature, created great terror among the titans with whom they fought. Learning that his army, overwhelmed by their foes, was losing ground, the invincible Indrajita arose, the sacrificial rites as yet uncompleted and, leaving the Nikumbhila Grove, that was darkened by trees, Ravani, enraged, ascended his chariot that stood ready harnessed and fully equipped; with his bow and arrows, he was formidable and resembled a heap of black collyrium, terrifying to behold with his reddened eyes, like unto Mrityu the Destroyer.", "Beholding him standing in his chariot and the titan host ranged round about him, rushing to attack Lakshmana with fury, Hanuman, the scourge of his foes, who resembled a mountain, uprooted a huge tree, difficult to wield and, like unto Kala\u2019s consuming fire, that monkey, with repeated blows, struck down the enemy on the battlefield where they lay insensible.", "Seeing the son of Pavana creating confusion in the ranks, thousands of titans attacked him with spears, those bearing lances with lances, those with swords with blows of their swords and those with harpoons with blows of harpoons. Iron bars, maces, sticks in their hundreds, Shataghnis, iron hammers, terrible axes, Bhindipalas, blows from their fists like unto lightning, slaps sounding like thunder, were all delivered at Hanuman, who like unto a mountain in stature, in his rage, created a terrible carnage.", "Then Indrajita beheld the foremost of the monkeys, the intrepid son of Pavana, like unto a rock, destroying his adversaries and, addressing his charioteer, be said:\u2014", "\u201cDrive towards that monkey; he will certainly destroy all the titans if he is suffered to do so!\u201d", "At this command, the driver set his course at Maruti and drove the invincible Indrajita, who was standing in the chariot, upon him. Then that redoubtable titan, drawing near, let fall arrows, blows from his sword, harpoons, spears and axes on the head of that monkey, so that those formidable missiles that fell upon him threw Maruti into a transport of rage and he said:\u2014", "\u201cO Perverse Son of Ravana, if you have any claim to valour, then fight; with your two arms strive with me 1 O Insensate One, if you dost withstand my might, you shalt be accounted as the foremost of the titans!\u201d", "Then Bibishana pointed out the son of Ravana, to Lakshmana, as he, with bow upraised, sought to slay Hanuman, and said:\u20141 See Glossary of Weapons.", "\u201cThe Conqueror of Vasava, the son of Ravana, standing in his car, is about to slay Hanuman! O Saumitri, do you slay Ravani with your formidable arrows of incomparable workmanship, the destroyers of their foes, that put an end to their lives!\u201d", "Hearing Bibishana\u2019s words, that magnanimous one, a veritable Bibishana,1 looked on Indrajita of dreadful prowess, who, standing in his chariot, was invincible and resembled a mountain.", "Having spoken thus, Bibishana, delighted, taking Saumitri, who bore his bow in his hand, hastened away. Proceeding some distance, they entered a great wood where Bibishana pointed out Indrajita\u2019s place of sacrifice to Lakshmana and the illustrious brother of Ravana showed Saumitri a huge Nyagrodha Tree of fearful aspect, resembling a dark cloud, and said:\u2014", "\u201cIt is here that the powerful son of Ravana offers up his victims and thereafter enters into combat. Becoming invisible to all creatures, the titan overthrows his enemies in the fight, paralysing them with his excellent shafts. Do you pierce the valiant son of Ravana, his chariot, steeds and charioteer with your flaming darts ere he reaches the Nyagrodha Tree!\u201d", "\u201cBe it so!\u201d replied the mighty Saumitri, the delight of his friends and, taking his stand, he drew his marvellous bow.", "Thereafter Indrajita, the powerful son of Ravana appeared before them in his chariot, that shone like fire, clad in armour with his sword and banner. Burning with ardour, Lakshmana challenged that invincible descendant of Paulastya, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI challenge you to combat I Let it be in fair fight!\u201d", "Thus accosted, the brave and exceedingly energetic Indrajita, observing Bibishana, overwhelmed him with reproaches, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO You, born and bred in this race, the brother of my sire, why dost you seek to harm his son, O My Paternal Uncle, O Titan? For you, O Wretch, there is neither tradition, brotherly feeling nor a sense of duty! O Impious One, You are to be pitied! O Perverse Being, you are the object of reproach to the virtuous, you who didst abandon thine own kind in order to seek service with the enemy. Is it not a want of intelligence in you, that you dost not discern the great difference between living with one\u2019s kindred and seeking a miserable refuge with strangers? Even if a stranger be endowed with every quality and a relation bereft of them all, yet the kinsman, though wanting in all merit, is to be preferred; a stranger is always a stranger! He who renounces his own kind to follow another will perish under the blows of the enemy after his own kinsfolk have been destroyed. You alone art capable of such ruthlessness and so relentless an attitude to your kind, O Ranger of the Night, O Younger Brother of Ravana!\u201d", "Thus addressed by his brother\u2019s son, Bibishana answered:\u2014\u201cArt you ignorant of my character that you dost reproach me thus, O Titan? O Perverse Prince, do not insult me but treat me with respect. Albeit I have been born in the race of titans, I possess those principles which appertain to men, my nature is not that of the demons! Nay, I do not delight in cruelty nor does injustice find favour with me but, even if his character be dissimilar, how can a brother banish his own brother? The one, who rejects him who renounces his duty and is bent on evil-doing, is assured of good fortune, as one who shakes off a snake from his hand. One is told to fly that perverse wretch who habitually purloins his neighbour\u2019s goods and has intercourse with other\u2019s wives, as one would flee from a burning dwelling.", "\u201cTo take possession of another\u2019s property or to look with desire on his neighbour\u2019s wife or to distrust one\u2019s friends are the three faults that lead to destruction! The ruthless slaughter of the great sages, the war on the Gods, arrogance, anger, hate and self-will are the defects of my brother, who is destroying himself and his empire, obscuring his good qualities as clouds veil the mountains. It is on account of his vices that I abandoned my brother, whose son you are. You, your father and Lanka are doomed! O Titan, You are a mere boy possessed of an overweening pride and art ill-mannered! Say what you will to me, you are caught in the noose of death I You shalt suffer the penalty you have merited for the harsh reproaches you have made to me this day! From henceforth you shalt not be able to approach the Nyagrodha Tree, O Vilest of the Titans! Having outraged Kakutstha, you canst not survive! Enter into combat with this God among men! Fall on the field of battle and go to the abode of Yama to the satisfaction of the Gods! Display your prowess, exhaust your weapons and missiles but if you approachest within the range of Lakshmana\u2019s shafts, you and thine army shalt not return alive!\u201d", "Hearing Bibishana\u2019s words, Indrajita, seething with anger, answered him with fresh invectives and advanced upon him in fury. Standing in his richly decorated chariot, that was yoked to black steeds, his weapons and sword upraised, bearing his mighty, pliant and terrible bow and his arrows that were fatal to the foe, he resembled the Destroyer, Death Himself.", "Then Lakshmana in all his splendour appeared before that mighty archer standing in his car, decked with ornaments, the slayer of his foes, the valiant son of Ravana, and, transported with fury, Indrajita addressed Saumitri, who was seated on Hanuman\u2019s back and resembled the rising sun, and Bibishana also and the foremost of the monkeys, saying:\u2014", "\u201cDo you all behold my prowess! In an instant, a rain of arrows speeding from mine irresistible bow will fall upon you in the fight like unto a shower of rain from the sky! Soon the shafts loosed from my great bow will scatter your limbs as the wind a heap of cotton! Pierced by my sharp darts, spears, lances, daggers and other weapons, this day I shall send you all to the abode of Yama! When, roaring like a thundercloud, I scatter the waves of mine arrows with a steady hand in the fray, who can stand before me?", "\u201cFormerly in a night engagement, with my darts that are equal to thunderbolts, I overthrew you both, leaving you unconscious with your escort; hast you forgotten it? Since you desirest to measure your strength with mine, I who in my fury resemble a venomous reptile, I deem you are anxious to enter the region of death!\u201d", "Hearing the taunts of Ravani, that Indra among the Titans, the son of Raghu replied indignantly:\u2014", "\u201cIt is not easy to succeed in those undertakings of which you dost boast and, in fact, he who accomplishes his end, alone is skilful! O You whose situation is desperate, you deemest to have attained your purpose in this enterprise which is untenable from every aspect, merely by saying I have accomplished mine end! O Insensate One, rendering thyself invisible on the field of battle is the procedure of a rogue; honest men do not practice it! Since I am within the range of your shafts, O Titan, manifest your prowess; of what use is this bragging?\u201d", "Thus addressed, Indrajita who was ever victorious in combat, stretched his dread bow and with a powerful arm let fly his whetted shafts on his adversary. Discharged by him, those swift arrows resembling venomous snakes, struck Lakshmana hissing like serpents, and the impetuous son of Ravana, Indrajita, with those arrows of extreme velocity, overwhelmed Saumitri, who was endowed with auspicious marks, whereupon the fortunate Lakshmana, his limbs pierced by those darts, covered in blood, shone like a smokeless flame!", "Meanwhile Indrajita, contemplating his feat, advanced, emitting an exceedingly loud cry and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Saumitri, the feathered shafts loosed upon you from my bow will rob you of your life, for their impact is mortal I This very day, O Lakshmana, bands of jackals, eagles and vultures will descend upon you when you have fallen unconscious under my blows! Rama of perverse soul will see you, his devoted brother, struck down by mine arm, thine armour shattered, your bow in pieces, your head severed, you who art a warrior by birth only!\u201d", "To these insolent words of Ravana\u2019s son, the sagacious Lakshmana replied in measured and judicious terms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cCease from boasting, O Wretched Titan of crooked ways, what purpose is served by vain speech? Demonstrate your valour in action; you dost vaunt thine exploits ere you have accomplished them! To what end, O Titan? Act in such a way that I may believe in thine utterances! Mark how, without addressing a single word of contempt or provocation to you and without bragging, I shall slay you, O Last of Warriors!\u201d", "Thus speaking, Lakshmama, with five Natachas loosed with great force from his bow, which he stretched up to his ear, struck the titan full in the breast and those feathered shafts of swift flight, resembling fiery serpents, shone in the breast of the Nairrita like the rays of the sun.", "Struck by those darts, the son of Ravana, enraged, in his turn, pierced Lakshmana with three well-aimed arrows. Thereupon an appalling and fearful exchange of blows ensued between those lions among men and titans, who sought to triumph over each other. Valiant and endowed with strength, both courageous by nature, each found it hard to overcome the other, neither having his equal in energy and prowess. Resembling two planets coursing through the heavens, those two heroes strove, so that they seemed like those two invincible warriors, Bala and Vritra, struggling proudly like two lions, standing immoveable as they showered innumerable darts on each other, and that King of Men and Prince of the Titans fought on with extreme ardour.", "Meanwhile the son of Dasaratha, slayer of his foes, arming himself with arrows, loosed them in fury on that Indra of Titans and at that twanging of his bow-string, the titan leader, his countenance ashen, fixed his gaze on Lakshmana.", "Bibishana beholding the blenched features of the son of Ravana, said to Saumitri who was engaged in combat:\u2014", "\u201cO Long-armed Warrior, I behold inauspicious signs round Ravana\u2019s son, hasten therefore for he is assuredly nearing his end!\u201d", "Thereupon Saumitri, selecting some arrows resembling venomous snakes, let fly those barbed shafts like unto exceedingly poisonous serpents on Indrajita and he, struck by those missiles like unto thunderbolts hurled on him by Lakshmana, was dazed awhile, his senses stupefied. Thereafter, beholding the valiant son of Dasaratha standing in the field, he flung himself upon him, his eyes red with anger and, drawing near, he began to taunt him afresh, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHow is it that you have forgotten my prowess, when at the first encounter you and your brother were bound and laid low, you who dost now seek to enter into combat with me anew? In that great struggle under mine arrows resembling thunderbolts, both of you with your followers were first felled to the earth by me and then deprived of your senses.", "\u201cMeseems it has escaped your memory! Since you have dared to challenge me, it is clear you desirest to enter the abode of Yama 1 If, at the first assault you didst fail to recognize my superior strength, I shall soon demonstrate it to you; stay therefore and face me with resolution!\u201d", "Speaking thus, he pierced Lakshmana with seven arrows and Hanuman with ten powerful whetted shafts; thereafter with re-doubled fury, Indrajita pierced Bibishana with a hundred well-aimed darts. Seeing this, the younger brother of Rama, unmoved, began to laugh, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThis is nothing!\u201d and that lion among men, Lakshmana, undaunted, taking up some dreadful darts, hurled them in anger on Ravani in the fight, saying:\u2014", "\u201cNay, it is not thus armed that warriors enter the fray, O Night Ranger! Your darts are trifling and without power, conducing to mine ease; it is undoubtedly not in this wise that brave men fight!\u201d", "With these words, he, from his bow, loosed a shower of arrows on his adversary. Shattered by Lakshmana\u2019s shafts, the heavy golden armour of the titan fell to pieces on the floor of the chariot, like a mass of stars falling from the sky. His coat of mail riven, riddled with wounds inflicted by Narachas, the valiant Indrajita resembled the rising sun and, full of ire, the courageous son of Ravana of redoubtable valour, struck Lakshmana with a thousand shafts, cleaving his celestial armour. Then, exchanging blow for blow, they rushed on each other and breathing heavily, engaged in a terrible struggle and, in the twinkling of an eye, their limbs were lacerated by arrows and from every part of their bodies the blood flowed.", "For a long time these two valiant warriors tore each other with their sharp weapons and, in their unbridled energy, the two skilled combatants sought to overcome each other. Both riddled with a mass of arrows, their armour and standards shattered, they caused the hot blood to flow, as waterfalls let loose their torrents, and they let a dreadful hail of missiles fly with a great clamour, like unto the dark destructive clouds of doom, loosing their floods from the sky.", "For a long time they fought thus without turning back or experiencing any fatigue and those foremost of archers let fly their shafts again and again, and the multi-shaped darts crossed and re-crossed each other in the air. With agility, speed and grace, the struggle between man and titan continued with an appalling din and each, on his side, raised a tremendous clamour inspiring terror, like unto a fearful tempest and the sound of those two redoubtable warriors in desperate combat resembled two clouds clashing in the sky. With golden-footed Narachas, those two warriors, sought to overcome one another, inflicting wounds from which rivers of blood flowed and from their pierced bodies the golden-hafted arrows, covered with blood, fell to the earth in which they buried themselves. By thousands their whetted shafts converged in the sky, cleaving and riving each other, and both let fall a formidable mass of darts in the struggle, so that they appeared like heaps of Kusha Grass destined for two sacrificial fires. The bodies of those illustrious heroes, full of wounds, shone like a Kimshuka or a Shalmali Tree, leaf-less and in full flower in the forest; and the impact was appalling, as Indrajita and Lakshmana fought, each desirous of overcoming the other.", "Lakshmana battled with Ravani and Ravani with Lakshmana, each striking the other without ceasing and the streams of arrows buried in their flesh gave those two powerful warriors the appearance of two hills covered with trees, and their limbs streaming with blood, riddled with arrows, shone like two fires.", "Thus did they fight for a long time without turning back in combat or giving way to exhaustion. Nevertheless, in order to allow the invincible Lakshmana, ever in the forefront of the fight, to overcome the fatigue of combat, the magnanimous Bibishana threw himself into the fray remaining near him to lend him his support.", "Seeing the desperate struggle between man and titan, who resembled two elephants with broken tusks desirous of overcoming each other, Ravana\u2019s valiant brother, curious to behold the outcome of the duel, stood in the forefront of the battle, his excellent bow in his hand.", "Standing erect, he stretched his great bow, letting fly long and pointed arrows on the titans and these shafts of burning impact, falling thick and fast, tore the demons to pieces as a thunderbolt rives the high mountains.", "Then, in their turn, Bibishana\u2019s followers, the foremost of warriors, arming themselves with maces, swords and harpoons, struck the valiant titans in the fight and, surrounded by his companions, Bibishana resembled a full-grown elephant in the midst of young tuskers pressing close to him.", "In order to encourage the monkeys, whose dearest wish was to slaughter their foes, Bibishana, the foremost of the titans, conversant with what was fitting to the occasion, uttered these pertinent words to them, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIndrajita is the sole support of the King of the Titans and this is all that is left of his army, why therefore, O Foremost of the Monkeys, have you relaxed your efforts? This wicked wretch being slain in the fore-front of battle, all the titan warriors, save Ravana, have been slain! The valiant Prahasta is dead and the all-powerful Nikumbha also, Kumbhakarna, Kumbha, Dhumraksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, Tikshnavega, Ashani-prabha, Suptagna, Yajnakopa, Vajradamshtra, Samhradin, Vikata, Arighna, Tapana and Mainda, Praghasa as well as Prajangha and Jangha, Agniketu, Durdharsha, Rashmiketu who was full of energy, Vidyujjihva, Dvijihva and Akampana, Suparshva, Shakramali, Kampana, Devantaka and Narantaka who was full of valour. By slaying all these countless and exceedingly powerful titans, you have swum the ocean and now it is for you but to cross the hoof mark of a cow. Attack the titans who still remain, O Monkeys; all these warriors, whose strength has filled them with pride, have perished in the fight. It is not fitting for me to slay my father\u2019s son, but, laying aside all pity for Rama\u2019s sake, I will put an end to my brother\u2019s offspring; yet though I desire to slay him, tears fill mine eyes and deter me; the long-armed Lakshmana will best know how to subdue him 1 O Monkeys, closing in upon him, place yourselves so that you may wipe out those who stand near to him.\u201d", "Thus incited by the exceedingly illustrious titan, the foremost of the monkeys demonstrated their delight by lashing their rails, and thereafter those tigers among the Plavamgamas, amidst repeated clapping of hands, emitted every kind of cry, like peacocks on beholding the clouds.", "Jambavan too was surrounded by his leaders and their forces and they assailed the titans with their nails and teeth and blows from stones. Thereafter that Lord of the Bears decimated the titans, who, banishing all fear, full of vigour, overwhelmed him with countless missiles such as darts, axes, sharp pikes, lances and spears, striking him, their exterminator, in the fray.", "Thereupon a formidable conflict ensued between monkeys and titans, like unto the fearful contest between the Gods and the Asuras fired with wrath, and Hanuman, enraged, broke off a mountain peak and having caused Lakshmana to dismount, slew the titans in their thousands. Meanwhile after a fearful combat with his maternal uncle, the valiant Indrajita, slayer of his foes, threw himself afresh on Lakshmana and a desperate duel arose between those two heroes amidst the general conflict. Then those valiant warriors let loose a rain of missiles with which they overwhelmed each other and, in the twinkling of an eye, they disappeared under a hail of arrows, as the glowing sun and the brightness of the moon under clouds at the end of summer. Their movements were so swift that one was unable to perceive when they took up their bows or stretched them or changed hands or loosed their shafts or selected or separated them or when they closed their fists or took aim and launched a succession of arrows with force, filling the sky on every side, nor was any object distinguishable. Lakshmana struck Ravani and Ravani, in his turn, struck Lakshmana and a general confusion arose between them during the combat. Barbed and pointed shafts, loosed by those two warriors, filled the space in the heavens as it were and those whetted darts, that fell in hundreds, spread over the cardinal points and the intermediate regions, so that everything was engulfed in darkness and extreme terror took possession of all beings.", "Then the orb of a thousand rays sank behind the Asta Mountains enveloped in shadow, and torrents of blood flowed that day and fearful beasts of prey emitted full-throated howls.", "\u201cMay good fortune befall the worlds!\u201d murmured the great Rishis, whilst the Gandharvas with the Caranas, panic-stricken, fled away.", "Meanwhile Saumitri with four arrows pierced the four black steeds caparisoned in gold of that Indra among the Titans, and, with the aid of a sharp, yellow, shining and terrible Bhalla, furnished with beautiful plumes, resembling Mahendra\u2019s thunderbolt, resounding like the clang of a gauntlet hurled with full force, that mighty son of Raghu severed the head of the charioteer from his shoulders while he circled round.", "Thereupon, his charioteer slain, Mandodari\u2019s valiant son seized the reins himself, taking up his bow; and it was marvellous to behold him driving his chariot as he fought. Yet while his hands were occupied with the steeds, his adversary struck him with pointed darts and while he attended to his bow, the horses were pierced with arrows. Then Indrajita, even though his horses were riddled with darts, caused them to circle bravely under the arrows loosed by Saumitri with exceeding lightness of hand. Seeing his charioteer slain in the fight however, the son of Ravana lost his zest for combat and grew anxious, and observing the titan\u2019s countenance change, the monkey leaders began to acclaim Lakshmana in the height of joy. Thereafter Pramathin, Rabhasa, Sharabha and Gandhamadana, eager to bring matters to a close, struck a mighty blow, and those foremost of monkeys, endowed with extreme vigour and remarkable valour, with a rapid bound, threw themselves on the four magnificent steeds of Indrajita.", "Under the weight of those monkeys who resembled mountains, the horses threw up torrents of blood and thereafter, crushed and mangled, fell lifeless on the earth. Having slain the titan\u2019s steeds and shattered his chariot, the monkeys, with a further bound, returned to Lakshmana\u2019s side.", "Springing from his car, the horses having perished, and his charioteer being slain, Ravani caused a shower of darts to fall on Saumitri, whereupon, like unto Mahendra, Lakshmana overwhelmed Indrajita with shafts and he, fighting on foot, his excellent steeds being dead, loosed countless whetted and marvellous darts on Saumitri in the fight.", "The mighty Ranger of the Night, Indrajita, his horses slain, stood in the field in a paroxysm of fury, flaming with valour, and in their desire to triumph, those two archers, armed with bows, hurled themselves against one another like two mighty elephants in the forest.", "Rushing this way and that, titans and monkeys slew each other, not wishing to abandon their leaders. At that moment, the son of Ravana began to encourage the titans and praised and gladdened them by addressing them thus:\u2014", "\u201cO Foremost of the Titans, a profound darkness reigns over all regions nor can we distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, therefore fight fearlessly in order to delude the monkeys and I too shall return to enter into combat in another chariot! O Brave Companions, do not suffer the monkeys to triumph whilst I am in the city!\u201d", "At these words, the son of Ravana, slayer of his foes, eluding the vigilance of the dwellers in the woods, re-entered the City of Lanka, inorder to provide himself with a fresh chariot; and he caused a car embellished with magnificent gilding, furnished with javelins, swords and arrows, harnessed to the most excellent of steeds and driven by a skilful and intelligent charioteer to be made ready, whereafter the illustrious Ravani, victor in combat, ascended it. Surrounded by the foremost of battalions, the valiant son of Mandodari, Indrajita, urged on by the force of destiny, left the city and, drawn by swift steeds, with exceeding courage he rushed on Lakshmana and Bibishana who accompanied him.", "Beholding the crafty son of Ravana, mounted in a chariot, Saumitri, the intrepid monkeys and the Titan Bibishana were astonished; Indrajita, however, struck down the foremost of the monkeys with fury. Under the clouds of arrows falling in hundreds and thousands, Ravani, victorious in combat, stretching his bow to a circle, slew the monkeys in his wrath, displaying his extreme skill, and the monkeys, overwhelmed by the Narachas of dreadful impetus, took refuge with Saumitri, as all beings with Prajapati. Thereupon, inflamed with martial ardour, that descendant of Raghu severed the bow of Indrajita, thus demonstrating his fleetness of hand but he, seizing hold of another, hastened to string it, yet Laksnmana shattered it also with three arrows and, having broken his weapons thus, Saumitri pierced Ravani\u2019s breast with five darts like unto venomous snakes. Then these shafts, leaving that great bow, having entered Indrajita\u2019s body, fell to the earth like huge red serpents.", "His weapon severed, vomiting blood, Ravani took hold of another powerful bow with its stout cord and, aiming at Lakshmana, with extreme speed caused a shower of missiles to fall upon him, like unto Purandara letting loose his floods. Yet, irresistible as that hail of arrows, poured down by Indrajita was, Lakshmana, the Conqueror of his Foes, standing immoveable, repelled them.", "Thus did Ravani witness Lakshmana\u2019s marvellous prowess, he who was the intrepid and valiant son of Raghu. Thereafter Lakshmana, in fury, pierced each of those titans with three shafts in the fight, manifesting the velocity of his arrows, and Indrajita, on his side, riddled him with a hail of shafts.", "Then that Indra among the Titans, grievously wounded by his valiant adversary, the slayer of his foes, loosed a continuous shower of arrows on Lakshmana but, ere they reached him, they were severed by the sharp spear of that warrior, the destroyer of his enemies, and Lakshmana, with a crescent-shaped arrow, cut off the head of Indrajita\u2019s charioteer in his excellent car, while he was coursing here and there.", "Deprived of their driver, the horses, without deviating from their course, continued to draw the chariot, advancing and describing circles in a marvellous manner. Thereupon Saumitri, of fixed courage, unable to control his anger, let fly his shafts against the titan\u2019s steeds causing them to take fright.", "Provoked by this action, the son of Ravana struck the terrible Saumitri with his ten arrows and those shafts, equal to lightning, that seemed composed of all the poisons, glanced off his golden armour.", "Seeing that his coat of mail was impenetrable, the son of Ravana, Indrajita, in a transport of rage, manifesting his lightness of hand, struck Lakshmana in the forehead with three arrows of graceful joints, and that illustrious warrior, the joy of the House of Raghu, with three shafts embedded in his forehead, shone in the forefront of battle like unto a triple mountain. Albeit thus smitten by the titan\u2019s arrows, Lakshmana, in his turn, instantly let fly five shafts which struck Indrajita, who was adorned with lovely earrings, full in the face.", "Thereafter Lakshmana and Indrajita, warriors of exceeding prowess, armed with powerful and mighty bows, overwhelmed each other with sharp arrows. With their limbs streaming with blood, those two heroes, Lakshmana and Indrajita, at that instant shone on the field of battle like two Kimshuka Trees in flower and each hurling himself on the other desirous of victory, pierced his opponent\u2019s limbs with formidable arrows. Filled with martial ardour, the son of Ravana smote Bibishana\u2019s handsome countenance with three darts and, having pierced that Indra of the Titans with three iron-tipped shafts, he struck all the monkey leaders one after the other.", "Highly provoked, the exceedingly energetic Bibishana felled the horses of the wicked Ravani with a mace, whereupon the mighty Indrajita, springing down from his car, his horses slain and his charioteer dead, hurled a javelin on his paternal uncle.", "Beholding this, the enhancer of Sumitra\u2019s delight, with his sharp arrow, severed it in ten pieces in its flight and it fell on the earth. Thereafter Bibishana, his mighty bow in his hand, let fly five Marganas, the impact of which being equal to lightning, and struck Indrajita, whose horses had been slain, in the breast. Having passed through his body, those golden-hafted arrows, that flew straight to their target, were stained with blood so that they resembled huge red serpents.", "Then, highly incensed against his paternal uncle, Indrajita, standing in the midst of the titans, selected a marvellous arrow of great power that he had received from Yama and, seeing him place that formidable shaft on his bow, the valiant and intrepid Lakshmana took up one of immeasurable power which had been bestowed on him during sleep by the God Kuvera, and that weapon was irresistible, nor could the Gods nor the Asuras with their leaders stand before it.", "And those excellent bows, resembling maces, when stretched by their arms, emitted a piercing sound like unto two ospreys and the two powerful arrows notched on those wonderful bent bows lit up the faces of the two heroes with a vivid glow. Those barbed shafts loosed from the bows illumined the heavens, striking against each other with a violent impact and the shock of those formidable weapons as they struck against each other caused them to burst into flame, emitting sparks and smoke. Like unto two great planets colliding together, they fell shattered in a hundred pieces on the battlefield.", "Seeing those weapons severed and broken in the forefront of the battle, Lakshmana and Indrajita were seized with mortification and fury and, in his anger, Saumitri armed himself with Varuna\u2019s shaft whilst Mahendra\u2019s conqueror, fighting on foot, let fly Rudra\u2019s weapon in the fight which shattered Varuna\u2019s dart, despite its immense potency. Thereafter, in his ire, the illustrious Indrajita, victorious in combat, as if about to destroy the worlds, took up the flaming Agneya Weapon but the valiant Lakshmana diverted it with the Solar Dart and, seeing his shaft thus baffled, Ravani, maddened with anger, seized hold of the Asura Weapon that was sharp and fatal to its foe. Then from his bow sped shining Kutamudgaras, spears, Bushundis, maces, swords and axes and, beholding that dire and dreadful weapon, irresistible to all beings, the destroyer of every missile, the illustrious Lakshmana arrested it with the aid of the Maheshwara Weapon.", "Thereupon a prodigious struggle arose between the rivals, causing the hair to stand on end and, from all sides, Beings, standing in the sky made a circle round Lakshmana and the heavens were filled with a host of Beings overcome with astonishment at the fearful tumult arising from that dread conflict between monkeys and titans. Rishis, Pitris, Gandharvas, Garudas and Uragas with Shatakratu at their head watched over Lakshmana during the fight and, in that instant, the younger brother of Raghava took up the foremost of shafts, the Avya Weapon of flaming impact, in order to transfix Ravana\u2019s son, and also the well-plumed and gilded dart, skilfully fashioned, to which the Celestial Host paid homage and with which Shakra, that mighty Lord of great energy, who is drawn by bay horses, formerly overcame the Danavas in the war between Gods and Asuras. That weapon of Indra\u2019s, undefeated in combat, foremost of shafts was placed by Saumitri on the most excellent of bows and the fortunate Lakshmana, in order to achieve his purpose, spoke to the presiding Deity of that weapon, thus:\u2014", "\u201cIf Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is truly virtuous and loyal and, in feats of heroism has no rival, then slay the son of Ravana!\u201d", "Thus speaking, that warrior, the slayer of his foes, stretched his bow up to his ear and let fly an arrow united to Indra\u2019s weapon on Ravani in the fight, that was incapable of missing its target, and it severed the lovely head of Indrajita, graced with earrings and its casque, causing it to roll on the earth. Separated from the body, Indrajita\u2019s huge head, streaming with blood, resembled a golden ball thrown on the ground; and the son of Ravana fell dead on the battlefield with his armour, his helmet and his broken bow.", "Then all the monkeys with Bibishana, beholding the corpse, shouted in exultation, as the Gods rejoiced at the death of Vritra, and in the skies, the Bhutas, magnanimous Rishis, Gandharvas and Apsaras, on beholding the leaders of the great titan army scattering on all sides, harassed by the victorious monkeys, emitted shouts of triumph.", "Hard pressed by the monkeys, the titans, flinging down their arms, hastily fled in disorder towards Lanka and, in the general stampede the titans, throwing away their weapons, lances, swords and axes, ran in all directions at once. Terror-stricken, harried by the monkeys, some re-entered Lanka, others threw themselves into the sea or took refuge on the mountain. Now that Indrajita lay dead on the battlefield, the titans fled away in their thousands. As the sun withdraws behind the Asta Mountain and its rays disappear, so did the titans vanish from the horizon when Indrajita had fallen. As the solar orb with its rays extinguished or a fire without heat, so did that long-armed warrior lie bereft of life and the world, freed from her sufferings and delivered from her enemy, rejoiced! And the blessed Shakra was exceedingly gratified at the death of that titan of evil deeds and the great Rishis also, whilst in the heavens, the Gods could be heard striking their gongs and the dancing Apsaras and the magnanimous Gandharvas caused a rain of flowers to fall that was marvellous to behold.", "On the death of that titan of cruel exploits, peace reigned, the waters became limpid, the air pure and Devas and Danavas rejoiced at the fall of one who was a source of terror to all the worlds. Thereafter a shout of triumph arose from the Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas who said:\u2014", "\u201cNow let the Brahmins go about their pursuits without anxiety, their sins removed!\u201d", "Then the monkey leaders, beholding that Bull among the Nairritas slain in battle, whose prowess was irresistible, paid homage to Lakshmana and Bibishana, Hanuman and Jambavan; and all the Plavamgamas, growling and leaping with chattering of jaws, surrounded that descendant of Raghu, lashing their tails and clapping their hands. \u2018Victory to Prince Lakshmana!\u2019 rose the cry and, embracing each other, the monkeys, their hearts filled with joy, hymned the praises of Lakshmana in every way.", "Witnessing that difficult feat of Lakshmana\u2019s, he who was the delight of his friends and seeing the corpse of Indra\u2019s adversary, the Gods, highly gratified, experienced supreme delight.", "[Full title: Rama commends Lakshmana who is cured of his Wounds by the Monkey Sushena].", "Lakshmana, graced with auspicious marks, his limbs bathed in blood, having slain that conqueror of his foes on the battlefield, experienced supreme satisfaction.", "Taking with him Jambavan, Hanuman and all the inhabitants of the woods, the valiant and illustrious Lakshmana speedily returned to Sugriva and Raghava, leaning on Bibishana and Hanuman. Thereafter, having circumambulated Rama and paid obeisance to him, Saumitri stood beside his brother as Upendra by Indra.", "Then that hero, Bibishana, approaching with a look which itself was eloquent of delight, described Indrajita\u2019s fearful end and it was with joy that Rama learned how the head of Ravani had been severed by the great-souled Lakshmana and the tidings that Indrajita had fallen under Lakshmana\u2019s blows filled that valiant prince with unequalled felicity so that he cried out:\u2014", "\u201cWell done, O Lakshmana, this exceedingly difficult feat pleases me! Ravani\u2019s death means victory, be assured thereof 1\u201d", "Thereafter, smelling the head of Lakshmana, who had increased his glory yet who was abashed, the mighty Rama caused him to be seated on his lap and, with gentle strength, having clasped his brother, who was wounded, to his breast, he gazed upon him tenderly again and again. Then Rama, smelling his head once more, passed his hand rapidly over his body and, in order to sooth him, said:\u2014", "\u201cYou have accomplished an auspicious and highly momentous feat, O You whose exploits are beyond the power of others 1 Now that his son is slain, I deem Ravana to be defeated. To-day the death of that perverse wretch confers victory over Ravana, the Scourge of Men, upon me, be you blessed, O Warrior! You have severed the right arm of the King of the Titans on which he leant for support! Bibishana and Hanuman too, bore themselves with valour in the great fight. In three days, that warrior was utterly vanquished; from now I am delivered from my foes, for Ravana will assuredly come forth, setting out with considerable forces. When, on hearing of the death of his son, which will overwhelm him with grief, the King of the Titans advances surrounded by his vast army, I shall encircle him with my powerful forces and slay him, difficult though it be. The conqueror of Indra having fallen in combat with you, under your direction, O Lakshmana, neither Sita nor the earth itself would be hard to regain 1\u201d", "Having lavished comfort and caresses on his brother, the son of Raghu, Rama, joyfully addressed Sushena, saying:\u2014", "\u201cDo you pluck out the arrows from the highly intelligent Saumitri, who is ever devoted to his friends, and restore him. Speedily heal the wounds of Saumitri, who is attached to his friends, and do you nurse back to health all those who received blows and wounds in the conflict, those bears and monkeys whose valiant battalions have trees as their weapons.\u201d", "At these words of Rama, the powerful monkey leader, Sushena, administered a sovereign remedy to Lakshmana\u2019s nostrils and having inhaled it, that hero was at once liberated from his darts and wounds. Restored to his normal state and freed from the arrows, his burning pains at an end, his fever suddenly allayed, Saumitri experienced supreme delight. Thereupon Rama, the King of the Plavagas, Bibishana and the valiant Chief of the Bears with their forces, seeing Saumitri standing free from pain, rejoiced exceedingly.", "Then that supremely difficult exploit of Lakshmana\u2019s was praised by Dasarathi of great soul, and, recollecting that the conqueror of Indra had fallen in the fight, the King of the Monkeys was filled with joy.", "Paulastya\u2019s ambassadors, having learnt of Indrajita\u2019s death and confirmed it, conveyed the tidings to Dashagriva in all haste, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Great King, Thine illustrious son has been slain by Lakshmana, who was accompanied by Bibishana; we were witness thereof I That hero, confronted by a hero, measured his strength with Lakshmana\u2019s 1 Your son, undefeated in any combat, he who triumphed over the Gods with Indra at their head, has gone to the Celestial Regions, having been overwhelmed by Lakshmana\u2019s shafts! \"", "Hearing of the terrible, cruel and grievous end of his son on the battlefield, that bull among the titans swooned away and only came to himself after a long time.", "Distracted with grief on account of his son\u2019s death, that unfortunate one, beside himself, burst into lamentation, crying:\u2014", "\u201cO You, the Conqueror of Indra, how hast you suffered thyself to be overcome by Lakshmana this day? In your wrath, wast you not able to strike down Kala and Antaka themselves with your shafts, as also the peak of the Mandara Mountain? How much more was it possible for you to strike down Laksh-mana in the fight? Hereafter the King of Death will be held in greater reverence by me, since to-day he has brought you under the sway of destiny, O Long-armed Warrior! Even among the Celestial Host, this is the path trodden by those skilful warriors who wage a brave fight! He who is slain in the service of his lord goes to the heavenly regions. Seeing Indrajita slain this day, the Gods and all the Guardians of the World, free from anxiety will sleep in peace! Now the Three Worlds and the entire earth with its woods appears deserted to me without the only Indrajita. To-day I shall hear the cries of the youthful daughters of the Nairritas in the private apartments, like unto the roar of elephants in a mountain cave. O Hero, where hast you gone, relinquishing your right to the throne, to Lanka, the titans, your mother, myself and your consorts? Assuredly, I should have preceded you to the abode of death so that I might have received those honours due to the departed, offered up by you, but the contrary has taken place, O Hero! Why do Sugriva, Lakshmana and Raghava still live and why hast you deserted me ere you had rid me of this triple thorn?\u201d", "Having first lamented thus, Ravana, the King of the Titans was overcome with a violent rage on account of the death of Indrajita and the grief at losing his son increased the fire of anger within him who was irascible by nature, as in the summer months the rays of the sun become more intense. From his halfopened mouth, he seemed to breathe forth flame and smoke in his rage, as Vritra formerly from his, and his eyes, naturally red, were further inflamed with ire, glowing in dreadful wise. Under the sway of anger, his aspect, ever a source of terror, caused him to resemble the enraged Rudra! Tears fell from the eyes of that infuriated monster like boiling oil from two flaming lamps. Grinding his teeth, he made a sound like unto the revolving of the rod with which the Gods and Danavas churned the milky ocean. Mad with anger, like unto Antaka eager to devour all bangs animate or inanimate, he allowed his gaze to wander over the four quarters of the horizon nor did any titan dare approach him, and in a transport of rage the King of the Titans, seated amidst his warriors, in order to excite their ardour, said:\u2014", "\u201cHaving practised penance for thousands of years and gratified Svyambhu on countless occasions, as the fruit of mine austerities, he accorded me complete immunity from Devas and Asuras.", "\u201cBrahma bestowed a coat of mail, that gleamed like the sun, on me which, in my conflicts with the Gods and Asuras, none of my foes, though armed with thunderbolts, were able to shatter. To-day, clad in that armour and mounted on my chariot of war, who will dare to withstand me, be it Purandara himself?", "\u201cThe great bow with its arrows bestowed on me when I gratified Svyambhu, after an encounter with Devas and Asuras, that redoubtable bow will be drawn by me to the sound of countless musical instruments, in a mighty battle, to Rama and Lakshmana\u2019s destruction!\u201d", "Tormented by the death of his son, the ferocious Ravana, overpowered by anger, having reflected within himself, resolved to slay Sita. Rolling his reddened eyes, that cruel and terrible titan, in his anguish, said in the presence of all the Rangers of the Night, in plaintive tones:\u2014", "\u201cMy unfortunate son, in order to deceive the monkeys, having had recourse to magic, showed them an illusory corpse, saying:\u2014\u2018This is Sita!\u2019 Verily it shall become a reality! I shall slay Vaidehi who is devoted to that evil wretch 1\u201d", "Having spoken thus, he seized hold of a sword that was well-tempered and bright as the stainless sky and rushed out in haste surrounded by his wives and counsellors. Ravana, whose heart was torn with grief on account of his son, taking up his sword, rushed out to find Maithili and seeing the king setting out in a great rage, the titans emitted leonine roars and embracing each other, said:\u2014", "\u201cTo-day we shall see those two brothers humbled! In his anger, Ravana has overcome the four Guardians of the World and countless others have fallen under his blows; the Three Worlds have yielded up their treasure to him whose prowess and valour have no equal on earth!\u201d", "As they were speaking thus, Ravana, in a transport of rage, was rushing to where Sita was to be found in the Ashoka Grove, and, though his friends sought to restrain him, he ran on, as in the sky the planet Rahu bears down on Rohini.", "The irreproachable Maithili, in the midst of the female titans who guarded her, beholding that furious titan with a great sword, was seized with terror, and the daughter of Janaka, Sita, seeing him continue to advance with that weapon upraised, though his friends sought to restrain him, in the height of misery, wailing, uttered these words:\u2014", "\u201cBeholding that wicked wretch rushing upon me in fury, I, who am defenceless but who yet have a defender, fear that he intends to slay me! Despite my loyalty to my lord, he entreated me again and again, saying \u2018Be my consort\u2019 and I constantly repulsed him. My refusal has assuredly caused him to give way to despair and, in a transport of fury, he is preparing to slay me. Or it may be that those two tigers among men, those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, have, on my account, been cut down to-day on the battlefield. I hear a great clashing of gongs and the exultant shouts of innumerable people rejoicing! Woe is me, the two princes have died for me or else this titan of cruel intent has come to slay me on account of grief over his son or he has been unable to slay Rama and Lakshmana! Why did I not follow Hanuman\u2019s counsel, miserable creature that lam! If I had departed, seated on his back, I should now be resting happily in the lap of my lord. Assuredly Kaushalya\u2019s heart will break when she learns that her son has perished in the fight and, weeping, she will recollect the birth, childhood, youth, virtuous deeds and beauty of that magnanimous hero. Overcome with despair, having offered up the obsequies in honour of her dead son, distracted with grief, she will ascend the funeral pyre or cast herself into the river. Cursed be that wicked hunch-back Manthara and her sinister counsels; it is she who is the cause of the sufferings which will overwhelm Kaushalya.\u201d", "Hearing the unfortunate Maithili lamenting thus, she, who resembled Rohini fallen under the sway of Rahu in the absence of the Moon, a virtuous and honest counsellor, the sagacious Suparshva, seeking with his companions to restrain Ravana, the King of the Titans, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cWhy, O Dashagriva, dost you, the younger brother of Vaishravana himself, seek to put Vaidehi to death in an access of rage, disregarding the law? You who art a student of the Veda, who hast been purified by pious observances and who delightest in the scriptures, how art you able to harbour the thought of slaying a woman? O Valiant Monarch of the Titans, spare the beautiful Maithili and loose the vials of your wrath on that man, entering into combat with him with our aid. This is the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight and to-morrow, on the day of the new moon, march to victory surrounded by your forces. Courageous, armed with your sword, in thine excellent chariot, a mighty car-warrior, you shalt cut down the terrible Dasarathi and take possession of Mithila\u2019s daughter!\u201d", "Thereupon the wicked and powerful Ravana, giving ear to the judicious words of his devoted counsellor, returned to the palace and re-entered the assembly hall surrounded by his friends.", "Having entered the council chamber, the unhappy king, the mighty Ravana, overwhelmed by the death of his son, seated on his throne, in the depth of affliction, breathing like an enraged lion, saluted the leaders of his army and addressed them saying:\u2014", "\u201cDo you set out at the head of cavalry with a column of chariots, elephants and horses, with which you are abundantly supplied, and, in the fight, hurl yourselves upon Rama only, overwhelming him with a rain of missiles, like clouds in the rainy season. Thereafter when your sharp darts have pierced his limbs in that great battle, to-morrow, I myself will put an end to Rama\u2019s life in the presence of all beings.\u201d", "On this command from their king, the titans set out in their swift-moving chariots followed by innumerable battalions. Armed with maces, harpoons, swords, arrows and life-destroying axes, all those titans struck the monkeys, who countered them with blows from rocks and trees. Then, as the sun rose, a great and terrible struggle ensued between titans and monkeys, fearful to behold and they struck each other with countless shining weapons, javelins, swords and axes in the fray and a prodigious dust storm, arising on account of the battle, was laid again by the rivers of blood from titans and monkeys. With elephants and chariots as the banks, javelins as the fish, standards as the trees, corpses as the floating logs, rivers of blood flowed.", "Though soaked in gore, the valiant monkeys, leaping hither and thither in the fight, hacked the banners, armour, chariots, horses and weapons of every kind to pieces. With their sharp teeth and nails the Plavamgamas tore the hair, ears, foreheads and noses of their opponents. A hundred of the foremost of the monkeys leapt on every titan like birds on a felled tree and the titans, like unto hills, struck the redoubtable monkeys with heavy maces, javelins, scimitars and axes. Cut to pieces by their foes, the great army of monkeys sought shelter with Rama, the son of Dasaratha, the only true refuge.", "Then that exceedingly energetic hero, taking up his bow, penetrating into the ranks of the titans, overwhelmed them with a hail of darts, and when he entered their lines, like unto the sun entering the clouds, those formidable warriors, whom he was consuming with the fire of his shafts, were unable to discern him. And the titans, beholding the terrible exploits of that hero so disastrous to them, recognized their author to be Rama, and as the passing of a hurricane through a forest becomes patent, so, when innumerable battalions were overthrown and great cars overturned, they perceived it to be his work. And they beheld their army decimated by arrows, battered and crushed by his shafts but, so rapid were his movements, that they could not see Rama and they were no more able to discern Raghava than beings distinguish the soul that governs the senses.", "\u201cThere is the one who is exterminating our cohorts of elephants!\u201d \u201cThere is he, who with his sharp arrows is destroying cavalry and infantry!\u201d", "Speaking thus, the titans, taking each other to be Rama in the fight, under this delusion, slew each other in anger, and they were not able to see the real Rama, who, nevertheless, was destroying their army, for they had all been thrown into bewilderment by the exceedingly mighty, marvellous and powerful Gandharva Weapon! And sometimes on that vast battlefield, thousands of Ramas appeared to the titans and sometimes they could only see one; and the bow of that hero seemed to them to be a myriad golden bows, whirling like a circling torch, while Raghava himself remained invisible I", "With his body the pivot, his strength the lustre, his arrows the spokes, his bow the felly, the twanging of the cord and the gauntlet the sound, the force of his intelligence its radiance, its splendour the impetus of his weapon, its circumference the circle traced by Rama, while he was massacring the titans, he resembled the Wheel of Time in the eyes of all beings. And in the eighth part of a day, Rama with his flaming arrows, single-handed, exterminated the army of the titans who were able to change their form at will, which comprised eighteen thousand great elephants, fourteen thousand cavalry and two hundred thousand infantry.", "Exhausted, their horses slain, their chariots shattered, their standards broken, those rangers of the night, who had escaped the carnage, took refuge in the City of Lanka.", "With the corpses of elephants, infantry and horses, the battlefield resembled the ground where the mighty Rudra, enraged, disports himself.", "Then Devas, Gandharvas, Siddhas and Paramarishis cried out:\u2014", "\u201cWell done! Well done 1\u201d lauding Rama\u2019s achievement.", "And the magnanimous Raghava said to Sugriva who stood near with Jambavan and the foremost of monkeys, Mainda and Dvivida:\u2014", "\u201cThe power to wield this terrible weapon belongs to me and Tryambaka alone!\u201d", "Having destroyed the army of the King of the Titans, Rama, the equal of the magnanimous Shakra, who amidst darts and arrows transcended all fatigue, received the delighted homage of the Celestial Host.", "All those thousands of elephants and horses and those mounted upon them with the myriad chariots bright as fire and their flaming banners, as also the innumerable titans who were full of valour, able to change their form at will, armed with maces and axes and wonderful golden pennants, fell under the fiery darts, decorated with fine gold, of Rama of imperishable exploits.", "Beholding this and hearing those tidings, the rangers of the night, who had escaped the carnage, were filled with terror and those wretched titans were united in a common misfortune.", "The female titans and those who had lost their sons and kinsfolk, overwhelmed with affliction, assembled to wail and lament, crying:\u2014", "\u201cHow did Shurpanakha, who was old, hideous and of sunken belly, dare to approach Rama in the forest, he who was the equal of Kandarpa himself? Seeing that handsome youth, full of nobility, ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, that monstrous Rakshasi, who should have been slain by others, was overpowered by lust. How could she, who was devoid of all good qualities, dare to make love to the all-powerful Rama who is possessed of comely features and endowed with every virtue? To the detriment of her own race, despite her grey hair and wrinkles, through a ridiculous infatuation condemned by all, that hideous creature pursued Raghava with her importunities to the destruction of the Titans, Dushana and Khara.", "\u201cIt was on her account that Ravana committed this offence, the fatal bearing away of Sita, the daughter of Janaka, and has provoked the emnity of the implacable and powerful Raghava.", "\u201cWhen the Demon Viradha sought to possess Vaidehi, he fell before her under Rama\u2019s blows; this example should have proved sufficient! And fourteen thousand titans of terrible deeds were cut down in Janasthana by Rama\u2019s shafts resembling flaming torches, whilst, in the fight, Khara was also slain with Dushana and Trishiras by his darts that glittered like the sun; this too should have been sufficient to prove his prowess!", "\u201cKabandha too, with his arms four miles in length, who lived on blood, was slain despite his fury and screams; this too was a manifestation of Rama\u2019s might. He slew the powerful son of that God of a Thousand Eyes, the mighty Bali who was as dark as a cloud, this too proved his valour! And Sugriva, who dwelt disconsolate on Rishyamukha, the vehicle of his hopes shattered, was restored to the throne by Rama, which was a further proof of his power.", "\u201cAll the titans counselled Ravana to his advantage, and Bibishana, in accord with his duty, offered him good advice in reasonable words but, in his folly, that monarch disregarded them.

Chariots, horses and elephants have been struck down in their thousands by the mighty Rama and are lying here and there with the foot soldiers whom he has also slain. He who is destroying us is Rudra or Vishnu or Mahendra or the God of a Hundred Sacrifices, in the form of Rama, unless he be the God of Death himself!

This day I shall be the elephant who tramples under his feet those divisions resembling lakes, with open lotuses the faces, the glistening stamens the bodies! This day, with each arrow loosed in the battle, I shall pierce the monkey forces in their hundreds, as they fight furiously with trees. By slaying mine adversary to-day, I shall dry the tears of all those who have lost their brothers or whose sons have perished. To-day, pierced by my shafts, so large a number of monkeys will lie scattered here and there that, through my prowess one will not be able to discern the earth\u2019s surface 1 To-day the crows, vultures and beasts of prey will be sated by the flesh of the foe struck down by my darts.", "\u201cLet my chariot be yoked with all speed and let my bow be brought immediately; let those rangers of the night, who are still here, follow me into battle!\u201d", "At this command, Mahaparshva gave his orders to the army leaders, who were present, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHasten to assemble the troops!\u201d On this, the leaders summoned the titans, going from house to house, making the entire circuit of Lanka at a rapid pace. Instantly all the titans of grim aspect ran out with a formidable clamour, carrying every kind of weapon in their hands. Swords, lances, clubs, maces, hammers, Halas, spears with sharp points, huge Kutamudgaras, harpoons of every kind, discus, pointed Parashvas, Bhindipalas, Shataghnis and various other arms. Thereafter four officers under his command, brought a hundred thousand chariots to Ravana and three hundred thousand elephants, sixty kotis of horses, mules and buffalo and innumerable foot soldiers, all hastening there at the king\u2019s command.", "Whilst the leaders rallied the forces who were to be found in the city, the sovereign\u2019s driver prepared his chariot; and it was superbly furnished with celestial weapons and embellished with every kind of ornament, filled with various arms, adorned with rows of bells, encrusted with pearls, blazing with its jewelled pillars and covered with thousands of golden pinnacles.", "Beholding it, all the titans were seized with exceeding admiration and, perceiving it, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans ascended thereon and mounted that car glittering like a myriad suns, blazing like fire itself, and effulgent with its own lustre. Then Ravana drove away immediately surrounded by innumerable titans, bearing down the earth as it were with the weight of his forces; and, amongst the titans on all sides, there was a great din of shouting and shrilling of pipes accompanied by tabors, war drums and conches.", "\u201cThere goes the King of the Titans with his fan and canopy, the abductor of Sita, the ruthless slayer of brahmins, that thorn in the side of the Gods, who is setting forth to fight the Prince of the House of Raghu I\u201d Such were the cries heard on all sides and, at the uproar, the earth trembled whilst the monkeys fled in terror.", "Meanwhile, the long-armed Ravana, surrounded by his ministers, marched on, full of the ardour of combat and certain of victory. At his command Mahaparshva, Mahodara and the indomitable Virupaksha ascended their chariots and these warriors, in their delight, emitted war cries loud enough to shatter the earth and, with formidable shouts, they set out eager for victory.", "The highly effulgent monarch, surrounded by his valiant battalions, rushed into battle, brandishing his bow, like Yama at the dissolution of the world, and that great warrior, mounted on his car harnessed to swift steeds set out through the gate where Rama and Lakshmana were encamped. At that moment the sun lost its brilliance, the quarters were enveloped in darkness, the birds emitted dreadful cries, the earth trembled, the Gods let fall a rain of blood and Ravana\u2019s horses stumbled, whilst a vulture alighted on the pole of his banner and sinister jackals howled. Then that titan felt his left eye twitch and tremors pass through his left arm; he grew pale and his voice seemed to die away. As Dashagriva set forth to fight, ill omens appeared presaging his death; a meteor fell from the sky with the crash of thunder and herons and vultures emitted mournful cries. Ravana, however, remained unmoved by the terrible portents that appeared and rushed madly to his doom, urged on by destiny.", "At the sound of the titan chariots, the rakshasa host and the monkey army also prepared to give battle and from every side, impatient for victory, challenged one another.", "Meanwhile, in his ire, Dashagriva with his golden shafts, created havoc among the monkeys and some among those heroic warriors had their heads severed by him and the hearts of others were pierced or their ears cut off and some fell lifeless, the flanks of others being tom, their heads broken or their eyes put out. Whenever the ten-headed titan, rolling his eyes furiously, turned his chariot in the fight, the ferocity of his assault was irresistible to the leaders of his foes.", "[Full title: The Fight between Virupaksha and Sugriva. Virupaksha\u2019s Death].", "The mutilated corpses of the monkeys, who had fallen under the shafts of Dashagriva were heaped on die earth, and the Plavam-gamas were as unable to endure that irresistible avalanche of darts loosed by Ravana, as butterflies a scorching fire. Tormented by those sharp arrows, they fled screaming like elephants enveloped in flames and Ravana advanced in the fight scattering them with his darts as the wind disperses the clouds.", "Having, in his fury, exterminated those inhabitants of the woods, that Indra among the Titans rushed on to find Raghava. Then Sugriva, seeing the monkeys cut to pieces and routed, gave over his position to Sushena and addressed himself for battle. Relinquishing his command to that monkey, who was his equal in valour, Sugriva went out to meet the enemy, a tree in his hand. At his side and following in his footsteps marched all the monkey leaders brandishing enormous rocks and every kind of tree.", "Thereafter that royal giant let forth a great shout and fell on that mob of titans, destroying their leaders, and that mighty monarch crushed the titan divisions, as at the end of the world cycle the wind breaks down the great trees; and he let fall a shower of stones on the titan divisions like a huge doud letting loose hailstones amidst a flock of birds in a wood. Under the avalanche of stones loosed by the King of the Monkeys, the titans, their heads shorn of their ears, fell like crumbling mountains, and whilst the titans were being overthrown by Sugriva, who was crushing them as they fell, they cried out. Then Virupaksha, armed with his bow, proclaiming his name, leapt down from his chariot and that indomitable titan mounted an elephant and, advancing thereon, and he, full of vigour, let forth a terrible cry and hurled himself on the monkeys. Thereafter he rained a shower of formidable darts on Sugriva in the forefront of battle and arrested the rout of the titans by reviving their courage.", "Riddled with wounds from the sharp arrows of the titans, that Indra of Monkeys, howling with rage, resolved to slay him and, brandishing a tree, that valiant and indomitable monkey leapt forward and struck the huge head of his adversary\u2019s elephant, and under the virulence of that blow, the great tusker sank down emitting loud cries.", "Then the courageous titan jumped down from the back of the stunned beast and, turning on the monkey, threw himself upon him, but he, clad in mail covered with the hide of a bull, unsheathing his sword, with a rapid step, rushed defiantly on Sugriva who stood fast, waiting. Then Sugriva met the impact of Virupaksha and thereafter let fly a great rock like unto a cloud, whereupon that lion among the titans, seeing the stone falling, jumped aside and, full of valour, struck the monkey with his sword. Pierced by the valiant titan\u2019s sword, the monkey lay on the ground for a time deprived of consciousness, then, suddenly rising to his feet in the great struggle, he whirled his fist round and round, bringing it down violently on the titan\u2019s chest.", "Wounded by his blows, the night-ranger, enraged, with his sword severed Sugriva\u2019s armour in the forefront of battle and, under the shock, he fell to his knees. Thereupon the monkey, picking himself up, gave the titan a terrific blow that resounded like thunder, but Virupaksha evaded it skilfully and, with his fist, struck Sugriva on the chest.", "Thereafter the monkey king waxed even more furious and, seeing that the titan had parried his thrust, sought an opportunity to attack him. In his rage, he struck him a violent blow on the temple like unto Indra\u2019s thunderbolt which felled him to the earth, and the blood flowed from his mouth covering him like water from a mountain torrent. Rolling his eyes in fury, foaming at the mouth and bathed in blood, he seemed more misshapen than ever and the monkeys beheld their enemy covered with blood, trembling, and rolling from side to side, emitting plaintive cries.", "Meanwhile the two valiant armies of monkeys and titans, who were fighting one another, began to create a terrible uproar like two seas that had burst their banks.", "In the presence of the all-powerful titan, who had been slain by the King of the Monkeys, the varied multitude of monkeys and titans resembled the Ganges in flood.", "In that fearful struggle, both armies gradually melted away under each others\u2019 blows like two lakes drying up under the summer heat. The destruction of his forces and the death of Virupaksha redoubled the fury of the Lord of the Titans. Seeing his army decimated and destroyed by the monkeys, he recognized that destiny was opposing him and he became apprehensive.", "Thereafter he addressed Mahodara, who stood near him, saying:\u2014\u201cFrom now on, O Long-armed Warrior, you are my only hope of victory! Go, triumph over the enemy forces! Display your heroism to-day; the time has come to return the favours your master has bestowed on you! Fight bravely!\u201d", "At these words, that foremost of titans, Mahodara replied:\u2014\u201cBe it so!\u201d and rushed on the enemy\u2019s army as a butterfly into a flame. Then that exceedingly powerful titan, whose ardour had been stimulated by the words of his master and also on account of his own native valour, began to create carnage among the monkeys.", "From their side, the noble-hearted monkeys, arming themselves with enormous stones, penetrated into the ranks of the redoubtable titans and slew them all. And Mahodara, at the height of fury, with his golden shafts severed the hands, feet and thighs of the monkeys in the great struggle and they, after a hard fight with the titans, fled to different quarters, some taking refuge with Sugriva.", "Witnessing the rout of his powerful army, Sugriva rushed upon Mahodara and the Lord of the Monkeys, seizing a huge and formidable rock resembling a hill, threw it at him with great force, in order to crush him.", "Seeing the stone falling, Mahodara, unmoved, cut it to pieces with his arrows. Under the titan\u2019s darts, it fell in a thousand fragments on the earth so that it resembled a flock of frightened vultures. Beholding that rock broken, Sugriva, mad with anger, tore up a Sala Tree and flung it at his adversary, who broke it into many pieces. With his shafts, that hero, the scourge of his foes, broke the tree, whereupon Sugriva, observing an iron stake lying on the ground, brandished the flash ng bar before the eyes of the titan and, with one exceedingly violent blow, struck down his excellent steeds.", "Leaping down from his great car, its team of horses having been slain, the valiant Mahodara, highly provoked, took hold of a mace and the two warriors, one armed with an iron bar and the other with a mace, approached each other, bellowing like bulls, resembling two clouds charged with lightning. In fury, the night-ranger, his lustrous mace glittering like the sun, rushed on Sugriva and, as the terrible club was falling upon him, the extremely valiant leader of the monkeys, his eyes red with anger, lifted up his weapon and struck, whereupon the bar instantly fell shattered to the earth. Then Sugriva, boiling with rage, from the ground picked up a huge club gilded on all sides and, brandishing it, hurled it against the mace, striking it, whereupon, on the impact, the two missiles broke in pieces and fell on the field.", "Their weapons shattered, the two warriors attacked each other with blows of their fists and, full of ardour and strength, resembled two lit braziers. Amidst loud cries, they struck each other and, having interchanged blows, rolled on the earth. Leaping up immediately, the two pugilists, great champions, scourgers of their foes, exhausted each other, whereupon each seized hold of a sword that lay within reach and, transported with rage, threw themselves upon each other, their weapons upraised. Then those two spirited and experienced warriors moved rapidly from left to right of one another, each seeking to slay his opponent. Meantime the courageous, impetuous and wicked Mahodara, proud of his strength, pierced Sugriva\u2019s heavy mail with his sword whereupon the weapon snapped on the impact. Then that elephant among monkeys, with his own sword, severed the titan\u2019s head bearing a helmet and adorned with earrings.", "Beholding their leader lying headless on the ground, the whole army of titans melted away and, having slain Mahodara, the monkey with his forces began to cheer, whereupon Dashagriva grew furious and Raghava was filled with joy.", "With downcast mien, the titans, overwhelmed, all fled away mad with terror, but the son of Surya,1 having laid Mahodara low, who resembled part of a great mountain, shone with effulgence like that orb itself with its inextinguishable brilliance. And the hosts of the Gods, Siddhas, Yakshas and also the beings who move on the surface of the earth, gazed with great delight on the King of the Monkeys, who had achieved that supreme victory.", "Mahodara having been struck down by Sugriva, the all-powerful Mahaparshva gazed on his slayer, his eyes red with anger and, with his shafts, began to sow disorder in Angada\u2019s formidable ranks; and as the wind detaches a fruit from its stalk so did that titan sever the upper limbs of the leading monkeys. With his darts, he cut off the arms of some and, full of ire, pierced the sides of others. Overwhelmed by those shafts, that Mahaparshva loosed upon them, the monkeys grew pale with fright and lost courage.", "Then Angada, wishing to give a little respite to his troops, who had been trampled upon and decimated by that titan, leapt up full of fury like the ocean on the day of the full tide. Seizing an iron bar that shone like the rays of the sun, that Prince of the Monkeys struck Mahaparshva in the struggle and he, losing consciousness, fell from his chariot, its driver having been slain, and lay senseless on the earth.", "Thereupon the mighty King of the Bears who resembled a heap of black antimony and was extremely powerful, arming himself with a huge rock like unto the peak of a mountain, strode ahead of his battalion, which resembled a cloud, and with a furious blow struck down the horses and shattered the chariot of the titan.", "Mahaparshva, however, regaining consciousness, leapt up in an instant and, in his great vigour, riddled Angada with innumerable arrows again and again and struck Jambavan, the King of the Bears with three spears full in the chest, wounding Gavaksha with innumerable shafts. Thereafter Angada, who was transported with rage, seized hold of an enormous stake and with that iron bar, bright as the rays of the sun, the son of Bali, his eyes red with anger, taking hold of it with both hands and brandishing it with force, with the intention of slaying him, hurled it on Mahaparshva, who stood some distance off.", "Thrown with force, the bar knocked the bow with its arrows from the hand of the titan and struck off his helmet, whereupon Angada, with a single bound, seething with rage, struck the titan a blow with his clenched fist on the ear, which was adorned with an earring.", "Enraged, the valiant and illustrious Mahaparshva seized hold of a great axe in one hand and with that stainless weapon washed in oil, made of solid stone, that titan, in a paroxysm of fury, struck his antagonist violently, but the blow, falling on the left shoulder, glanced off his armour. Then Angada, the equal of his sire in valour, furious, lifted up his fist which was as powerful as lightning and knowing the vital parts of the body, delivered a blow like unto Indra\u2019s thunderbolt on the chest of the titan, close to his heart.", "On this the titan, his heart riven by the shock, fell dead on that vast battlefield, and seeing him lying stretched on the earth without life, his army took fright, whilst Ravana fell into a transport of rage.", "Thereafter the monkeys with Angada, let forth a joyous roaring that resounded far and wide, shattering the gates and turrets of Lanka as it were. The Gods too with their king let forth a great shout and that enemy of Indra, the Lord of the Titans, enraged on hearing the immense uproar among the inhabitants of the Celestial Regions and the forests, resolved to enter into the lists once more.", "Beholding Mahodara and Mahaparshva slain and, despite his great strength, the valiant Virupaksha also struck down, a great rage seized Ravana, who urged on his charioteer with these words:\u2014", "\u201cBy slaying Rama and Lakshmana I shall remove that double scourge, the cause of the slaughter of my faithful adherents and the siege of the city. In the fight I shall cut down Rama, that tree of which Sita is the flower and the fruit, whose branches are Sugriva, Jambavan, Kumuda, Nala, also Dvivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana, Hanuman, Sushena and all the leading monkeys.\u201d", "Thereupon that mighty car-warrior, who caused the ten regions to resound, drove rapidly on Raghava with his chariot, and the earth, with its rivers, mountains and woods, trembled with the uproar, and the lions, gazelles and birds that inhabited it were seized with terror.", "Then Ravana employed a dark and magic weapon that was formidable and terrifying and with it he consumed the monkeys, who fled hither and thither. Amidst the dust raised by their battalions, for they were unable to endure that weapon created by Brahma himself, Raghava, seeing those countless divisions taking refuge in innumerable places, pursued by Ravana\u2019s powerful shafts, stood ready waiting.", "Meanwhile that Tiger among the Titans, having routed the army of monkeys, beheld Rama standing there unconquered with his brother Lakshmana, like unto Vasava with Vishnu, and Rama seemed to touch the sky as it were as he stretched his great bow and those heroes with eyes as large as lotus petals were long-armed and the conquerors of their foes.", "From his side the extremely illustrious and valiant Rama, who was accompanied by Saumitri, seeing Ravana overwhelming the monkeys in the fight, joyfully took hold of the centre of his bow and immediately began to bend that excellent weapon that was stout and sonorous, riving the earth as it were.", "At the sound of Ravana\u2019s loosing a myriad arrows and Rama stretching his bow, the titans fell to the ground in their hundreds! Thereafter Ravana, coming within a bow\u2019s length of the two princes, resembled Rahu in the presence of the sun and moon. Desiring to be the first to enter into combat, Lakshmana with his sharp arrows, having placed them on his bow, loosed his shafts resembling flames of fire. Hardly had that archer let fly his darts into the air than the extremely energetic Ravana stayed them in their course, severing one with one, three with three and ten with ten, thus demonstrating his lightness of hand. Leaping over Saumitri, that triumphant warrior, Ravana approached Rama in the conflict, who stood ready like unto an unscalable mountain. Bearing down on Raghava, his eyes red with anger, the Lord of the Titans loosed a rain of shafts upon him but, with the aid of his sharp arrows, Raghava severed those innumerable darts that flamed in formidable wise and resembled venomous snakes.", "Thereafter Raghava struck Ravana with redoubled blows and Ravana struck Raghava and they riddled each other with a hail of varied and penetrating missiles and, for a long time, described marvellous circles round each other from left to right, overwhelming each other with swift arrows, each remaining undefeated. And all beings were seized with terror witnessing that desperate duel between those two redoubtable bowmen, the equals of Yama and Antaka. The sky was covered with clouds rival by lightning flashes and the firmament became, as it were, pierced with holes by a rain of whirling arrows of extreme velocity, possessing sharp points, adorned with heron\u2019s plumes. With their darts, they first obscured the sky as when the sun withdraws behind the Astachala Mountains and two great clouds suddenly appear.", "Thereafter, between those two warriors, each seeking to slay the other, an incomparable and unimaginable struggle ensued like unto the duel between Vritra and Vasava. Both were furnished with excellent bows, both were skilled warriors, both brought exceptional knowledge in the science of arms to the fight. In all their manoeuvrings they were followed by a stream of shafts as the waves in two oceans that are whipped up by a tempest.", "Then, with a skilful hand, Ravana, the Destroyer of the Worlds, aiming at Rama\u2019s forehead, loosed a formidable succession of iron shafts from his bow, which Rama received unmoved on his head like a garland of lotus leaves. Thereupon, reciting a sacred formula, arming himself with Rudra\u2019s weapon and choosing a large number of spears, full of wrath, the illustrious Raghava bent his bow and with force let fly those weapons in rapid succession against that Indra of Titans but those darts fell without breaking through the armour of Ravana, who, like an immense cloud, remained unmoved.", "Then Rama, skilled in the use of arms, struck Ravana afresh on the forehead, as he stood in his chariot, with arrows to which he had joined a miraculous weapon, and it appeared as if fiveheaded serpents in the form of darts were penetrating hissing into the earth repelled by Ravana whom they sought to devour. Thereupon, having rendered Raghava\u2019s weapon void, Ravana, in a transport of rage, armed himself in his turn with the dreadful Asura weapon which he loosed joined to sharp and terrible arrows with huge points, having the heads of lions, tigers, herons, geese, vultures, falcons, jackals and wolves or resembling serpents with five heads. Others had the heads of donkeys, boars, dogs, cocks, aquatic monsters and venomous reptiles and those sharp arrows were the creation of his magic power. Struck by the Asuric shafts, that lion among the Raghus, he who resembled the God of Fire himself, responded with the Agneya Dart that was full of power and to it he joined arrows of every kind with points that burnt like fire and which resembled suns, planets and stars in hue or great meteors like unto flaming tongues. Those formidable missiles belonging to Ravana striking against those loosed by Rama, disintegrated in space and were annihilated in their thousands.", "Thereupon all the valiant monkeys with Sugriva at their head, able to change their form at will, beholding the titan\u2019s weapon destroyed by Rama of imperishable karma, let forth joyous acclamations and made a circle round him.", "Then the magnanimous son of Dasaratha, the descendant of Raghu, having destroyed that weapon discharged by Ravana\u2019s own arm, was filled with felicity, whilst the leaders of the monkeys joyfully paid homage to him.", "His weapon having been destroyed, Ravana, the King of the Titans, whose fury was redoubled, in his wrath instantly produced another; and he loosed the fearful Rudra Weapon, forged by Maya, on Raghava. Thereafter, from his bow, innumerable spears, maces, flaming bars hard as diamond, mallets, hammers, chains and spiked clubs, like unto fiery thunderbolts, issued forth like the tempests at the dissolution of the worlds.", "Then the glorious Raghava, most skilled in the knowledge of excellent shafts, that warrior of great renown, broke that weapon with the aid of the marvellous Gandharva Dart, and when it was shattered by the magnanimous Raghava, Ravana, his eyes red with fury, loosed his Solar Weapon whereupon huge and brilliant discs issued from the bow of the skilful Dashagriva of redoubtable courage, which, falling, lit up the sky on every side and the four quarters were consumed by the fall of those flaming missiles that resembled the sun, moon and stars.", "With a mass of arrows Raghava destroyed those discs and darts loosed by Ravana in the fore-front of the battle and, seeing his weapon broken, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans with ten arrows struck Rama in his vital parts. Struck by ten shafts that Ravana had discharged from his great bow, the exceedingly energetic Raghava did not flinch and, in his turn, that victorious prince, in the height of anger, pierced Ravana in all his limbs with the aid of innumerable darts.", "At that instant, the younger brother of Raghava, the valiant Lakshmana, slayer of hostile warriors, armed himself with seven arrows and, with those exceedingly swift shafts, that illustrious prince severed Ravana\u2019s standard in many places, which bore the image of a man\u2019s head. With a single arrow, the fortunate Lakshmana of immense vigour, cut off the head adorned with brilliant earrings of the titan who drove the chariot, and with five sharp arrows severed the bow resembling the trunk of an elephant that belonged to the King of the Titans.", "Thereafter Bibishana, bounding forward, with his mace slew Ravana\u2019s beautiful horses that were as tall as hills and resembled a dark cloud in hue, whereupon Dashagriva, leaping quickly from his car, the steeds of which having been slain, was filled with exceeding wrath against his brother and that powerful and spirited monarch loosed a flaming spear on Bibishana like unto a thunderbolt, but ere it reached its target, Lakshmana severed it with three arrows, whereupon a great cheer arose amongst the monkeys in that formidable struggle, and that spear, wreathed in gold, fell down shattered in three fragments like unto a great meteor falling from the sky amidst a shower of flaming sparks.", "Then the titan, that mighty Ravana of wicked soul, armed himself with another superior and tested spear which Death himself would have found hard to resist and which was of immense size and shone with its own effulgence. Brandished with violence by the mighty Ravana of perverse soul it gave out a lurid gleam so that it appeared like forked lightning.", "Meanwhile the valiant Lakshmana, perceiving that Bibishana stood in peril of his life, placed himself quickly in front of him and that hero, stretching his bow, with a rain of darts riddled Ravana, who stood waiting to discharge the weapon he held in his hand. Under the shower of arrows with which the courageous Saumitri overwhelmed him, thus frustrating his design, the titan no longer thought of striking him in return. Seeing that he had preserved his brother\u2019s life, Ravana, who was standing before him, addressed him thus:\u2014", "\u201cO You whose strength renders you arrogant, since you have preserved this titan, my spear shall fall on you; having pierced thine heart, this bloodstained weapon that mine arm, equal to an iron bar, will hurl at you will rob you of your life\u2019s breath and return to my hand.\u201d", "Thus did Ravana, speak and in a paroxysm of rage, levelling that pick adorned with eight extremely loud bells, created magically by Maya, that was infallible, the slayer of its foes, the splendour of which flamed up as it were, hurled it at Lakshmana with a mighty shout. Loosed with terrible violence and a sound of thunder, that spear fell with force on Lakshmana in the forefront of the battle.", "Then Raghava sought to mitigate the power of that weapon and said:\u2014", "\u201cMay good fortune attend Lakshmana! May this mortal impact be rendered void!\u201d", "Released by the enraged titan on that indomitable hero, the spear which resembled a venomous snake, falling with extreme violence, penetrated his great chest and so brilliant was it that it appeared like the tongue of the King of the Serpents. Loosed with force by Ravana, that spear penetrated deep into the body of Lakshmana who, with his heart pierced, fell on the earth.", "Beholding Lakshmana in that condition, near to whom he stood, the extremely powerful Raghava, full of solicitude for his brother, felt his heart stricken, but after an instant\u2019s reflection, his eyes welling with tears, enraged as is Pavaka at the dissolution of the world, he thought\u2014\u2018This is not the time for lamentation\u2019 and thereafter he entered once more into the fearful conflict, resolved to make a supreme attempt to slay Ravana.", "His eyes fixed on his brother, Rama saw how he had been pierced with a spear in the great fight and was covered with blood, resembling a mountain with its reptiles. And the most vigorous of monkeys sought to draw out that weapon loosed by the mighty Ravana, overwhelmed though they were by a hail of shafts discharged by the King of the Titans; the spear, however, having passed through Saumitri\u2019s body had penetrated into the earth. Then Rama, with his powerful hands seized hold of that spear and, in his wrath, snapped it, throwing the fragments to a great distance and, as he drew it out, Ravana penetrated his every limb with his shafts that pierced to his very marrow. Ignoring these darts, Rama embraced Lakshmana and said to Hanuman and that mighty Monkey Sugriva:\u2014", "\u201cYou foremost of the monkeys, gather round Lakshmana! O King of the Monkeys, the time has come for me to manifest my prowess! For long I have sought this occasion I May the wicked Dashagriva of infamous exploits perish! My longing resembles that of the Chatak bird on beholding the clouds at the end of summer. Ere long, I swear to you either Ravana or Rama will cease to exist in the world I You shall be witness thereof! The loss of the kingdom, my sojourn in the forest and my wanderings in the woods of Dandaka, the insult offered to Vaidehi, my encounter with the titans, the great and terrible misfortune that has visited me, this torment resembling hell will be wiped out this day when I slay Ravana on the battlefield! He on whose account I took the army of monkeys in my train, having installed Sugriva, when I had slain Bali in the open field, and on whose account I crossed the ocean, having thrown a bridge over it, that wretch to-day has come within my range of vision and shall therefore cease to live. Appearing before me, Ravana cannot survive any more than one who comes into the presence of a serpent whose glance is poisonous or a snake falling under Vainateya\u2019s gaze. Be tranquil witnesses of my combat with Ravana, O Invincible Ones, Foremost of the Monkeys; seat yourselves on the brow of the mountain. To-day in this duel, the Three Worlds with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and Caranas will recognize Rama\u2019s attributes! I shall accomplish a feat that the world with all beings who move or do not move, as also the Gods, will recount as long as the earth exists!\u201d", "Speaking thus Rama began to discharge his penetrating shafts embellished with gold at Dashagriva. From his side, Ravana, like a cloud from which the rain falls, showered down arrows and clubs with violence on Rama. And a mighty uproar arose when, in order to slay each other, those marvellous arrows were loosed by Rama and Ravana. Severed and scattered, the shafts with flaming points discharged by Rama and Ravana fell from the sky on the earth, and the twanging of their bows, causing great terror amongst all beings, was astonishing to hear. Then that amazing hail of missiles, that the mighty hero let fly in continuous streams from his burning bow, overwhelmed Ravana who, terrified, took to flight like a great cloud driven before the tempest.", "Seeing the courageous Lakshmana lying on the battlefield drenched in blood, struck down by the spear discharged by the mighty Ravana, Rama entered into a terrible duel with that cruel titan whom he overwhelmed with a hail of arrows. Then he addressed Sushena and said:\u2014", "\u201cThe valiant Lakshmana, struck down by the ruthless Ravana, is writhing like a serpent, filling me with anguish 1 When I behold that hero, dearer to me than life itself, how, in mine affliction, can I find the strength to fight? If my brother, who is endowed with auspicious marks, that proud warrior, returns to the five elements, of what use is life or prosperity to me? My prowess is ebbing away as it were and my bow seems to be falling from my grasp; mine arrows are blunted, mine eyes blinded with tears, my limbs are heavy as when one is overcome by sleep, my thoughts wander and I long to die! In this extreme misfortune in which I am plunged, weeping, my mind distracted on seeing my brother, who is emitting inarticulate cries, lying in the dust of the battlefield, brought low by the wicked Ravana, a prey to suffering and seriously wounded in his vital parts, even victory cannot bring me felicity, O Hero. If the moon is hidden from sight what delight can it give? Of what use is it to fight? What purpose is served by living? The combat has no longer any meaning since Lakshmana is lying dead in the forefront of the battle. As that illustrious warrior followed me when I retired to the forest so will I follow him now to the abode of death.", "\u201cEver affectionate to his kinsfolk, he was undeviatingly devoted to me; I was led to this pass by the titans who have made use of magic in the fight. Wives may be found everywhere and everywhere one may meet with friends but I see no place where one could find so dear a brother. Without Lakshmana of what use will it be for me to rule over a kingdom, O Invincible Warrior? What shall I say to Sumitra who loves her son so tenderly? I shall not be able to endure the reproaches with which she will address me. What shall I say to my mother Kaushalya or even to Kaikeyi? What answer shall I give to Bharata and the exceedingly powerful Shatrughna? Having gone with him to the forest, how can I return without him? Better were it to die than suffer the censure of my family. What sin did I commit in a former life that my virtuous brother is now lying dead before mine eyes? O My Brother, O Foremost of Men, O First of Heroes, O Prince, why, forsaking me, will you repair to the other regions? How comes it that you dost not answer me who am lamenting? Rise, look about you, why dost you remain lying there? Witness my grief with thine own eyes! In my despair, be my comforter, O Long-armed Warrior, overwhelmed as I am with anguish, wandering distracted amidst the woods and mountains.\u201d", "As Rama was speaking thus, overwhelmed with affliction, Sushena, in order to comfort him, addressed these well-considered words to him:\u2014", "\u201cO Tiger among Men, abandon this idea that causes you pain, this thought that pierces thine heart as a javelin in the forefront of the battle. Nay, Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, has not rejoined the five elements for his features have not changed nor is he pale, rather is his countenance serene and handsome! Observe how the palms of his hands resemble the petals of a lotus and his eyes are bright. Those who appear thus have not yielded up their lives, O Lord of all Mai! Do not grieve O Hao, Conqueror of your Foes, Lakshmana lives, and the proofs are the multiple beatings of his heart united with his sighs even though his body lies stretched on the earth.\u201d", "Thus spoke the extremely sagacious Sushena to Raghava and thereafter he addressed that great monkey, Hanuman, who stood near and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Friend, go quickly, repair to the Mountain Mahodaya! Formerly you have heard of it from Jambavan, O Warrior! On the southern peak grow curative habs, the plants named Vishalyakarani, Savarnyakarani, Samjivakarani and also Samd-hani of great virtue. Bring them back, O Warrior, in orda to revive that hero, Lakshmana.\u201d", "At these words, Hanuman repaired to the Mountain of Habs but there he became anxious, for that illustrious monkey could not recognize those remedial plants. Then the thought came to Maruti, whose strength was immeasurable, \u2018I will carry back the peak of the mountain for it is on the summit that the auspicious herbs are growing, at least I infer so from what Sushena has said. If I return without having picked the Vishalyakarani, the loss of time will prove fatal and a great misfortune will follow.\u2019", "Reflecting thus, the mighty Hanuman hastened on his way and when he reached that high mountain, he shook the summit three times and having broken it off, balanced it, with its multitudinous trees in full flower of varying fragrance, in his two hands. Thereafter, like a dark cloud charged with rain, that monkey sprang into the air carrying the mountain peak and returned in great haste setting it down and, having rested awhile, he said to Sushena:\u2014", "\u201cI am not conversant with the medicinal plants, O Bull among Monkeys, here is the whole summit which I have brought to you I\u201d", "At these words of the son of Pavana, Sushena, the foremost of the monkeys, having uprooted the herb, took hold of it and there was great amazement among the monkeys witnessing Hanuman\u2019s feat which even the Gods themselves could only have accomplished with difficulty.", "Then the foremost of monkeys, Sushena, having crushed that herb, held it to Lakshmana\u2019s nostrils and on inhaling it that prince, the scourge of his foes, who was riddled with arrows, instantly rose from the ground released from the darts and his sufferings. Meanwhile the monkeys beholding him standing erect cried out \u2018Excellent! Excellent!\u2019 and, full of joy, paid homage to him.", "Then Rama, the slayer of his foes, said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cCome, Come!\u201d and, embracing him, pressed him dose to his heart, his eyes wet with tears. Thereafter, having embraced him, Raghava said to Saumitri:\u2014\u201cO Hero, what good fortune to see you return from the dead! Nay, assuredly neither life nor Sita nor victory had any attraction for me; in sooth what reason had I for living since you had returned to the five elements?\u201d", "Then Lakshmana, pained, answered the magnanimous Raghava who had spoken thus and, in a voice trembling with emotion, said:\u2014", "\u201cBound by your vow, O You who hast truth for your prowess, it does not become you to utter such cowardly wordsI Nay, those who speak with sincerity do not render a promise void and the proof they give is the fulfilment of their vow! You should not give way to despair on mine account, O Irreproachable Hero 1 Mayest you redeem your word by Ravana\u2019s death this day. Nay, when he comes within the range of your shafts, thine adversary must not return alive, as a great elephant may not live when he falls under the sharp tooth of a roaring lion. I desire to see that wretch perish ere the orb of the day withdraws behind the Astachala Mountain, his task accomplished. If you seeks the death of Ravana on the battlefield, if you wishest to fulfil your duty and if you dost aspire to re-capture the princess, O Illustrious Hero, do what I tell you without delay.\u201d", "Hearing Lakshmana\u2019s words, the valiant Raghava, the destroyer of hostile warriors, at the head of his forces, took up his bow and stretching it allowed a shower of his formidable shafts to fall on Ravana.", "From his side, the Lord of the Titans, mounted on his chariot, rushed on Kakutstha, as Svarbhanu on Bhaskara; and Dashagriva, standing in his car, assailed Rama with darts like unto lightning, as a great cloud covers a huge mountain with its floods. Then Rama, with his arrows that were decorated with gold and resembled flaming brands, overwhelmed Dashagriva with them on the battlefield.", "On this the Gods, Gandharvas and Kinneras declared:\u2014\u2018This combat is unequal, Rama is on foot whilst the titan is in a chariot!\u2019 whereupon the foremost of the Gods, the blessed Shakra, having heard the words of the Immortals, called Matali to him and said", "\u201cWith my chariot repair speedily to where the illustrious Raghava is fighting on foot! Go to the battlefield and invite him to ascend this car; do you render this signal service to the Gods!\u201d", "On this command from his king, Matali, the celestial charioteer, bowing, made answer, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWith all speed I go to fulfil my duty as a charioteer!\u201d", "Thereupon he harnessed the bay horses to the most handsome of cars, the body of which being wrought with gold and hung with hundreds of little bells, with its emerald shafts shone like the rising sun, and it was yoked to excellent dappled steeds flecked with white, caparisoned in gold, their coats gleaming like the orb of day. A standard fluttered on a golden staff over that marvellous car belonging to Indra and, under the order of the King of the Gods, Matali ascended it and, leaving the Celestial Regions, went to meet Kakutstha. Armed with a lash, standing in the car, Matali, the charioteer of that God of a Thousand Eyes, having paid obeisance to him with joined palms, said to Rama:\u2014", "\u201cSaharaksha, O Kakutstha, O Renowned Destroyer of your Foes, has lent you this car so that you mayest be victorious! Here too is Indra\u2019s great bow, his shield bright as fire, his arrows shining like the sun and his goodly spear well-burnished! Ascend the chariot, O Warrior, and with me as your charioteer, triumph over the Titan Ravana, as did Mahendra over the Danavas!\u201d", "Thus addressed, Rama whose splendour illumines the worlds, circumambulated the car and, bowing, ascended it. Thereafter a wonderful combat of chariots ensued between the long-armed Rama and the Titan Ravana, causing the hair to stand on end.", "Raghava, skilled in the use of powerful arrows, fought with the King of the Titans, matching Gandharva Weapon against Gandharva Weapon and Celestial Arrow against Celestial Arrow. Then the royal night-ranger, in a paroxysm of fury let fly a formidable missile on his rival, marvellous, dreadful, befitting a demon. Loosed from Ravana\u2019s bow, those shafts, decorated with gold, falling on Kakutstha, were transformed into serpents of subtle venom and those fearful monsters with brassy faces, vomiting searing flames from their gaping mouths, sprang on Rama, and those reptiles whose contact was equal to Vasuki of iron coils and violent poison, enveloped all regions on every side filling the whole of space.", "Seeing those serpents falling on him in the fight, Rama chose the dreadful and appalling Garuda Weapon and discharged it. Leaving Raghava\u2019s bow, those golden-hafted arrows, brilliant as flames, transformed themselves into golden eagles, slayers of serpents, and all the darts in the form of snakes were destroyed by arrows in the shape of birds, that belonged to Rama, who was able to change his form at will.", "Enraged at the destruction of his weapon, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, caused a shower of formidable shafts to fall on Rama and while he was riddling Rama of imperishable exploits with thousands of darts, he wounded Matali with countless others. Thereafter, having aimed at the golden standard, Ravana shattered it with a single shaft and the golden device fell from the height of the chariot to the floor. With a series of arrows he struck Indra\u2019s steeds, to the exceeding terror of the Gods, Gandharvas, Caranas and also the Danavas and, seeing Rama wounded, the Siddhas and great Rishis were troubled as also the King of the Monkeys and Bibishana.", "When the moon of Rama was concealed from their sight by Rahu in the form of Ravana, Budha, in the constellation of Prajapati, rushed on Rohini, the beloved of Shashin, to the misfortune of all beings. With its mist-wreathed waves, flaming as it were, the ocean, surging up in fury, seemed to touch the orb of day; and the sun in the grasp of the Planet Dhumak-etu assumed a brassy hue dreadful to behold, its rays extinguished, revealing a headless trunk on its disc; Angaraka too was in opposition to the brilliant star of the Koshalas, the presiding Deities of which being Indra and Agni; and in the heavens, that planet tormented Vishaka also, and Dashagriva with his ten faces and twenty arms, equipped with his bow, looked like the Mountain Mainaka.", "Meanwhile Rama, overwhelmed by that ten-necked demon, was unable to loose his arrows in the conflict and, knitting his brows, enraged, his eyes inflamed, was transported with anger and it seemed as if he would consume the titan.", "On seeing the furious countenance of the virtuous Rama, all beings were seized with terror, the earth shook, the mountains, frequented by lions and tigers, trembled, the trees swayed to and fro, the Ocean, that Lord of Rivers was agitated and flocks of crows, braying like donkeys, described circles in the sky on all sides.", "Beholding Rama wrought up with extreme ire and those fearful portents, all beings were filled with fear and Ravana too felt dismayed. The Gods in their chariots, the Gandharvas, the great Serpents, the Rishis, the Danavas, Daityas and winged creatures of the air gazed down on that conflict between those two warriors, who fought with every kind of dreadful weapon, so that it appeared like the dissolution of the worlds. Suras and Asuras who had come to witness the struggle, with their eyes followed that formidable duel, uttering words of sympathy and encouragement and the assembled Asuras cried out to Dasha-griva \u2018Victory to You!\u2019 and the Suras addressing Rama reiterated \u2018Triumph! Triumph!\u2019", "At that instant the wicked Ravana, in his fury against Rama whom he wished to slay, took hold of an immense weapon that was as hard as diamond, deafening, the destroyer of its foe, furnished with spikes like unto mountain peaks, dreadful to conceive or behold, and Ravana lifted up that lance with its smoke-wreathed flaming point, like unto the fires at the time of the final dissolution of the worlds, that was greatly to be feared, irresistible and which death itself could not endure, the terror of all beings, whom it was able to crush to fragments. At the height of anger, he raised his strong arm and, surrounded by his brave troops, brandishing his weapon, that colossus, his eyes red with fury, emitted a piercing cry in order to encourage his forces, and earth, sky and the four quarters trembled at that fearful shout of the King of the Titans. With his stout arm, taking hold of that weapon he emitted a great cry and addressed his opponent insolently in these words:\u2014", "\u201cThis spear, as strong as a diamond, O Rama, that I wield in my wrath, through my prowess will shortly rob you and your brother of your lives! You shalt share the fate of my brave soldiers whom you didst massacre in the forefront of the battle. Stay therefore that I may strike you down with this lance, O Raghava.\u201d", "At these words, the King of the Titans hurled his weapon at Rama, and loosed by Ravana\u2019s hand, that lance wreathed in lightning, deafening with its eight bells, passed through the air with a blinding flash.", "Seeing that flaming spear, formidable to behold, Rama stretched his bow and discharged an arrow with force, but as the spear fell, Raghava loosed a mass of arrows to intercept it, so that he appeared like Vasava with his floods seeking to stay the encroachment of the fires at the end of the world period. As butterflies are consumed by flames, so were those shafts consumed by Ravana\u2019s huge spear; then Raghava, seeing his aerial shafts reduced to ashes, pulverized by contact with that lance, was transported with anger and furious in the extreme. Thereafter Rama, Joy of the House of Raghu, took up his spear favoured by Vasava, that Matali had brought to him; wielding it with his powerful arm, that lance, the destroyer of the worlds, with its sonorous bells lit up the sky like unto a brilliant meteor. In its flight, colliding with the spear belonging to that Indra of the Titans, it was shattered by the impact and that enormous lance fell bereft of its splendour. Thereafter Rama pierced Ravana\u2019s swiftly-moving steeds with shafts loosed with great force that were thunderous and flew straight to their target. Displaying all his strength, he wounded his rival in the breast with penetrating javelins and his brow with three arrows, whereupon Ravana, his whole body pierced with arrows and covered with blood, which flowed from wounds in all his limbs, resembled an Ashoka Tree in full flower. His body riddled with darts loosed by Rama, bathed in blood, feeling himself utterly exhausted, that Lord of the Rangers of the Night, in the midst of his army, was filled with extreme wrath.", "Grievously wounded by the wrathful Kakutstha, Ravana, that proud warrior fell into a great rage. His eyes flaming with anger, that titan raised his bow in a paroxysm of fury and in that great combat, overwhelmed Raghava with blows. Like unto a heavy shower, Ravana deluged Rama as clouds fill a pond. Drowned in a rain of arrows loosed from the titan\u2019s bow in the fight, Kakutstha stood firm like unto a mighty mountain.", "Then that hero, resolute in combat, with his shafts deflected the succession of darts which fell upon him like unto the rays of the sun. Thereafter, with a skilled hand, the ranger of the night, in fury, struck the breast of the magnanimous Raghava with thousands of darts and the elder brother of Lakshmana, covered with blood, looked like a huge Kimshuka Tree in flower in the forest. His wrath roused by the wounds he had received, the exceedingly powerful Kakutstha armed himself with shafts the lustre of which resembled the sun\u2019s at the end of the world period; and Rama and Ravana, both transported with anger, became invisible to each other on the battlefield that was darkened by their shafts.", "Thereafter at the height of fury, the valiant son of Dasaratha addressed his adversary in these mocking and ironic words:\u2014", "\u201cHaving carried away my consort against her will in Janas-thana, imposing on her ignorance, you are verily no hero! Bearing away by force, Vaidehi who was wandering forlornly in the great forest far from me, you think \u2018I am a great hero 1\u2019 Because you have molested other women who were without a protector, which is the act of a coward, you deemest thyself to be a hero, O Valiant One 1 O You who hast overthrown the ramparts of duty, O Arrogant Wretch of fickle nature, in thine insolence, you have invited death into thine house, saying \u2018I am a hero!\u2019 Is it in the role of the valiant brother of Dhanada that you, grown presumptuous on account of power, hast accomplished this memorable, great and glorious exploit? You shalt presently receive a fitting recompense for this infamous act. O Wretch, in thine own estimation, thinking to thyself \u2018I am a hero,\u2019 you wast not ashamed to bear Sita away like a thief. Had I been there when you didst affront Vaidehi, handling her so brutally, I should have dispatched you to rejoin your brother Khara by striking you down with my shafts. By good fortune, O Insensate One, you are now before me; to-day with my penetrating darts, I shall hurl you into Yama\u2019s abode. To-day your head with its dazzling earrings, severed by my weapon, shall roll in the dust on the battlefield where the wild beasts will devour it. Vultures will swoop on your breast when you are lying stretched on the earth, O Ravana, and will drink the blood greedily that flows from the wounds inflicted by my sharp arrows. To-day pricked by my shafts, lying without life, birds of prey will tear out thine entrails as eagles destroy serpents I\u201d", "Speaking thus, the valiant Rama, scourge of his foes, covered that Indra among Titans, who stood near, with a hail of arrows, and his courage, strength and martial ardour in loosing his shafts was redoubled. Then all the celestial weapons belonging to Raghava, versed in the Science of the Self, presented themselves before him1 and, in his joy, that illustrious hero felt the dexterity of his touch increase.", "On these auspicious signs appearing of themselves, Rama, the Destroyer of the Titans, attacked Ravana himself with increasing violence.", "Wounded by innumerable rocks thrown by the monkeys and the darts showered upon him by Raghava, Dashagriva\u2019s heart fainted within him and, in the agitation of his soul, he neither took up his arrows nor stretched his bow nor sought to oppose Rama\u2019s valour, while the arrows and missiles of every kind discharged unceasingly by his adversary had death as their target so that the hour of his doom appeared imminent.", "Then his charioteer, observing the peril, drove the chariot calmly and slowly out of the fray and, aghast at the appearance of the king, who had sunk down bereft of energy, he turned that dreadful car, rumbling like a cloud, and left the battlefield in haste.", "Distracted with fury, his eyes red with anger, urged on by destiny, Ravana addressed his charioteer, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAm I then bereft of valour and strength, deprived of prowess, cowardly, infirm of purpose, weak, without energy, devoid of magic powers and debarred from combat, that you have failed me and attest on thine own understanding? How comes it that without respect for me and disregarding my commands, in the presence of the foe, you didst drive my chariot from the field! Through thine error this day, O Vile Wretch, that which I had won over a long period, glory, valour, honour and renown, are all lost to me! Before a foe famed for his prowess, who prides himself on his exploits, you have transformed me who delights in battle, into a coward. If it is not through heedlessness that you have acted thus, O Villain, my suspicions are well founded and you have been bribed by the enemy. Assuredly it was not an act of friendship or devotion; only a foe would conduct himself as you have done. If you have any loyalty to me, then return in the chariot instantly ere mine adversary has departed and remember the benefits you have received at my hands.\u201d", "At these reproaches from the insensate Ravana, the sagacious charioteer made answer in words that were moderate and full of good sense, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI am neither afraid, nor am I mad, nor do I yield to the solicitations of a foe, nor am I negligent, nor have I ceased to be loyal to you, nor have I forgotten the benefits I have received from your hand! It was through my desire to be of service to you and to safeguard your glory and on account of a sincere attachment, that I acted as I thought best! O Great King, you should not unjustly regard me as a vile and cowardly wretch, I who seek only to do that which is agreeable to you. Hear me, I will tell you the reason why I took your chariot, resembling a flowing current driven back by the tide, from the field.", "\u201cObserving your fatigue following on the tremendous struggle, I no longer recognized your proud assurance nor your superior strength. By drawing the chariot unceasingly, my steeds were overcome with fatigue, they were prostrate and overcome with the heat, like unto kine lashed by the rain; furthermore amidst the portents that were manifest in great numbers, not one, it seemed to me, was favourable to us.", "\u201cOne should at the proper time and place observe the characteristics, gestures, facial expression, depression or exhilaration and the measure of fatigue of one\u2019s master, O Mighty Hero; also the place where the earth is firm and where it is uneven or level, where it is flat or hilly and the time for combat; when the enemy lays himself open to attack, how to advance and retire, to halt or go forward, to meet the enemy or retreat to a distance, all this must be known by a charioteer, as he stands in his chariot.", "\u201cIt was on account of your prostration and the exhaustion of your steeds and in order to mitigate this terrible fatigue, that I undertook those specific measures. It was not from caprice, O Warrior, that I drove the chariot away; it was devotion to my lord that made me resolve to act in this wise. Issue any command you desirest, O Hero, O Scourge of Your Foes, and I shall fulfil it implicitly with all my heart!\u201d", "Then Ravana, fully satisfied with the reply of his charioteer, addressed many words of praise to him and, in his martial ardour, said:\u2014", "\u201cSpeedily drive my chariot towards Raghava, O Charioteer, Ravana is incapable of turning back ere he has destroyed his enemies in battle!\u201d", "Speaking thus, the King of the Titans standing in his chariot, bestowed a brilliant ring of great price on his charioteer and, under his orders, the driver set out to the battlefield. Urged on by Ravana\u2019s command, the charioteer whipped his steeds into a gallop and, in an instant, the great chariot belonging to that Indra among the Titans stood before Rama in the field.", "[Full title: The Sage Agastya instructs Rama in the Hymn to the Sun: Aditya-hridaya\u2014the designation of a Vedic Hymn]", "Meanwhile, seeing Rama exhausted by the fight, standing absorbed in thought on the battlefield, and Ravana, facing him, preparing to begin the encounter anew, the blessed Agastya who had joined the Gods, and also come there to witness the great combat, approached that hero and said", "\u201cRama, Rama, O Long-armed Warrior, hearken to the eternal secret which will enable you to overcome all thine adversaries. It is none other than the \u2018Hymn to the Sun\u2019 (Aditya-hridaya), O Dear Child, it is sacred, capable of subduing the foe and brings victory; this prayer is eternal, imperishable, exalted and auspicious, the delight of the good, the destroyer of all ills, the allayer of fear and anxiety, the increaser of life and the most excellent of all verses:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O You, who on rising art crowned with rays, to whom the Devas and Asuras pay homage, salutations to You!

O Long-armed Warrior, the hour has come when you will triumph over Ravana!\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Agastya returned whence he had come. These words dispelled the grief of the illustrious Raghava who felt himself fortified, full of ardour and well pleased. Thereafter meditating on Aditya he recited the hymn and experienced supreme felicity. Having rinsed his mouth three times and purified himself, that hero took up his bow. Seeing Ravana, he rejoiced and advanced towards him in order to enter into combat, calling up his whole strength with the intention of slaying him.", "At that instant the Deity of the Sun, amidst the Host of the Gods, knowing that the destruction of the Lord of the Rangers of the Night was at hand, casting glances of joy and supreme satisfaction on Rama, approached him and said:\u2014\u201cPut forth thine whole strength!\u201d", "Thereafter Ravana\u2019s charioteer drove his car forward speedily, with joy, eating up space as it were, and that chariot, capable of crushing hostile armies, bore an immense standard and resembled the City of the Gandharvas. Harnessed to excellent steeds, garlanded with gold, it was filled with implements of war and adorned with flags and banners. The scourge of enemy forces and the joy of its own, Ravana\u2019s car was driven with exceeding velocity by its charioteer.", "Then that prince of men, Rama, observed the chariot of the King of the Titans, rolling noisily along with its great standard, harnessed to dreadful black horses and resembling a Vimana in space, bright as the sun, dazzling to behold, like unto Indra\u2019s bow, and the rain of arrows falling therefrom resembled the waters loosed by a cloud. Seeing the chariot of his adversary, which bore down upon him like a cloud, with a sound resembling a mountain shattered by lightning, Rama instantly stretching his bow, like unto the crescent moon, said to Matali, the charioteer of that God of a Thousand Eyes:\u2014", "\u201cO Matali, behold the furious pace of the chariot of mine adversary as he rushes upon me in violent rage! Be vigilant and drive to meet the car of my foe, I wish to destroy him as the wind scatters a rising cloud! Without swerving or confusion, your glance alert, your mind steady, holding the reins with a firm hand, drive swiftly I Assuredly you have no need of my counsel, accustomed as you are to drive Purandara\u2019s chariot, yet in mine ardent desire to enter into combat, I make appeal to thine experience, I do not instruct you.\u201d", "Extremely gratified by Rama\u2019s words, Matali, the most excellent charioteer of the Gods increased the speed of his car. Passing Ravana\u2019s great chariot on the right hand, he covered it with the dust of his own wheels.", "Enraged, Dashagriva, his eyes inflamed with anger, riddled Rama with arrows as he stood before him. Provoked by the blows, Rama, whose strength was redoubled by his fury, armed himself with Indra\u2019s extremely powerful bow and his great arrows of exceeding swiftness that glittered like the rays of the sun. Thereupon a fierce combat ensued between the two warriors, who stood face to face like two proud lions, each desirous of destroying the other.", "At that moment, Devas, Gandharvas, Siddhas and Para-marishis, hoping for Ravana\u2019s downfall, assembled to witness that duel between those chariots.", "Thereafter dreadful portents appeared, causing the hair to stand on end, foreshadowing death to Ravana and victory to Raghava. And the Gods caused blood to fall on Ravana\u2019s chariot; a great whirlwind blew from left to right whilst, in the sky, a large flock of vultures flew over his head following the evolutions of his car. Though still day, Lanka, enshrouded in the light of dusk, hued like a Japa flower, seemed aglow; great meteors accompanied by lightning fell with the sound of thunder and the titans were seized with terror witnessing those portents so unfavourable to Ravana. In whatever direction the titan drove, the earth shook and the limbs of his soldiers appeared as if paralysed. The rays of the sun falling before Ravana seemed to him coppery, yellow and white, like unto mountain ores, and the vultures and jackals who pursued him, their jaws vomiting flames, began to howl on beholding his lugubrious and downcast mien distorted with anger. Contrary winds blew raising clouds of dust on the battlefield, so that the King of the Titans was unable to distinguish anything. Indra loosed his thunderbolts on all sides on his army with an unendurable sound, without a single threatening doud appearing; all the cardinal points were enveloped in darkness and a dense cloud of dust hid the sky. Dreadful birds (Sharikas\u2014Turdas Salica or Gracula Religiosa) fought desperately among themselves, falling in hundreds before his chariot, emitting fearful cries. From his horses\u2019 flanks sparks flew continually and from their eyes tears fell, fire and water thus issuing from them simultaneously. Many other terrifying portents, foretelling Ravana\u2019s death, appeared, whilst omens propitious to Rama, foreshadowing his imminent triumph, could be seen.", "Beholding those inauspicious signs, Raghava was greatly delighted and regarded Ravana as already slain. Seeing those portents relating to himself, which he knew how to interpret, Rama experienced supreme felicity and, full of confidence, manifested a matchless energy in the struggle.", "Then the desperate duel of chariots between Rama and Ravana broke out with increased fury so that all the worlds were seized with terror.", "The battalions of titans and innumerable companies of monkeys stood motionless with weapons in their hands and, beholding those two warriors, man and titan, all were amazed, their hearts beating rapidly. Ready for combat, their arms filled with every kind of missile, they stood absorbed in the spectacle, forgetting to loose their shafts at one another, and the titans had their eyes riveted on Ravana and the monkeys on Rama so that both armies took on a strange aspect.", "Meanwhile, witnessing those portents, both Raghava and Ravana, steady, resolute and full of anger, fought with determined courage. \u2018I shall triumph\u2019 reflected Kakutstha, \u2018I must die\u2019 thought Ravana and both displayed their full strength with assurance in the encounter.", "At that instant, Dashagriva, in his wrath, placed his arrows (on the bow) and loosed them with force in the direction of the standard on Raghava\u2019s chariot but those missiles failed to reach the flag in Purandara\u2019s car and, glancing off the support, fell on the earth. Meanwhile Rama, enraged, stretched his bow with energy, resolving to return blow for blow and, aiming at Ravana\u2019s banner, loosed a sharp arrow resembling a great snake, irresistible, shining in its own lustre; and he let fly his weapon in the direction of Dashagriva\u2019s standard, which being severed, fell to the earth.", "Beholding his flag torn down and overthrown, the extremely powerful Ravana, inflamed with ire, blazed with wrath and indignation and, under the goad of his fury, let fall a hail of flaming shafts, striking Rama\u2019s horses. These celestial steeds, however, did not flinch, remaining motionless as if brushed by lotus stalks and, seeing the horses unafirighted, Ravana, enraged, discharged a fresh rain of arrows, maces, iron bars, discus, clubs, rocks, trees, spears and axes, and those weapons were all created by magic, and, summoning up all his powers, he loosed them in hundreds and thousands. Appalling and terrible was that unending flood of weapons re-echoing with a sinister sound but Ravana failed to strike Rama\u2019s chariot, though his shafts fell on the monkey host on all sides covering the whole of space, and thus Dashagriva, unheeding, fought on.", "Seeing him deploying increasing efforts in the struggle, Kakutstha, as if smiling, took up his sharp arrows and loosed them in hundreds and thousands. Observing them fall, Ravana, with his shafts, covered the entire sky and, on account of that rain of dazzling missiles loosed by those two antagonists, it seemed as if a second heaven of weapons had been created and, amongst them, there was not one that did not attain its target, not one, that did not pierce another and not one, that was loosed in vain; and, having collided with one another, they fell to the ground.", "Thus Rama and Ravana fought with an increasing supply of weapons and, in the struggle, they showered down their spears without pause to right and left, so that these formidable weapons covered the firmament; Rama striking Ravana\u2019s steeds and Ravana striking those belonging to Rama; thus, both exchanged blow for blow and both, in the height of anger, entered upon a tremendous duel causing the hair to stand on end. Then with sharpened arrows Rama and Ravana continued their combat and, contemplating his broken standard, Ravana was consumed with rage.", "Witnessing the combat between Rama and Ravana, all beings were struck with amazement and those two warriors, assuming a dreadful aspect in the struggle, highly enraged, determined on mutual slaughter and, in their excellent cars, bore down on each other. Thereupon their drivers, parading their skill as charioteers, advanced, circled and manoeuvred in various ways. In their rapid course and swift evolutions, those two marvellous chariots ranged the battlefield, whilst the two warriors discharged countless shafts on each other, like unto clouds letting loose their showers.", "Having displayed their immeasurable resource in the use of weapons, those two champions halted face to face, chariot shaft to chariot shaft, their horses\u2019 heads touching, their standards intertwined. Then Rama loosed four sharp arrows, driving back Ravana\u2019s four spirited steeds and he, furious on beholding them retreat, let fly his penetrating shafts on Raghava.", "That hero, however, grievously wounded by the mighty Dashagriva, manifested neither agitation nor emotion and again the Ten-necked One discharged his shafts, that resounded like thunder, aiming at the charioteer of that God who bears the Thunderbolt; and he struck Matali with his arrows with great force without being able to disturb him in any way or cause him to falter. Nevertheless Raghava, indignant at the affront offered to Matali more than if it had been directed at himself, with the aid of a succession of darts, decided to humble his adversary, and the valiant Raghava discharged twenty, thirty, sixty and thereafter hundreds and thousands of shafts on his rival\u2019s chariot.", "On his side, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, standing in his car, enraged, overwhelmed Rama with an avalanche of maces and clubs and the struggle became more desperate causing the hair to stand on end.", "At the sound of the maces, clubs and axes and the loosing of plumed arrows, the seven seas were agitated and the tumult of the oceans sowed terror in the Danavas and Pannagas in their thousands, in the depths of hell. The earth shook with its mountains, forests and jungles; the orb of day lost its brilliance and the wind ceased to blow. Devas, Gandharvas, Siddhas and Paramarishis were wrought up with anxiety as also the Kinneras and Great Serpents.", "\u201cMay good fortune attend the cows and brahmins! May all the worlds endure forever! May Raghava emerge triumphant in his combat with Ravana, the King of the Titans!\u201d", "Offering up these prayers, the Devas accompanied by hosts of Rishis witnessed that duel between Rama and Ravana, a spectacle that caused the hair to stand on end, and the hosts of the Gandharvas and Apsaras, watching that indescribable struggle, cried out\u201cThe sky resembles the sea and the sea the sky, but the fight between Rama and Ravana resembles nought but itself!\u201d", "Thus did they speak on beholding the combat between Rama and Ravana. In his rage, the Long-armed Warrior, the increaser of the glory of the Raghus, Rama, placed an arrow, like unto a venomous reptile, on his bow and cut off one of Ravana\u2019s heads, whereupon that glorious head, adorned with sparkling earrings, rolled on the earth in the presence of the Three Worlds. Nevertheless another, equal to the former, grew immediately and Rama, with a steady hand, dexterously sundered the second head with his shafts. Hardly was it eliminated when another head appeared which was severed once more by Rama\u2019s darts like unto thunderbolts.", "Thereafter he struck off a hundred more, being unable to bring Ravana low, and that hero, conversant with every weapon, he the increaser of Kaushalya\u2019s delight, who had made use of innumerable missiles, reflected:\u2014", "\u2018These were the shafts by the help of which I slew Marica, Khara, and Dushana as also Viradha in the Krauncha Wood and Kabandha in the Dandaka Forest; these were the shafts wherewith I transfixed the Sala Trees and the mountains and Bali and with which I agitated the ocean! All these weapons found their target, how is it that they have so little power over Ravana?\u2019", "Absorbed though he was in his reflections, Raghava, without ceasing from action, let loose a shower of arrows on the breast of his adversary. On his side, Ravana, the Lord of the Titans, standing in his chariot, enraged, overwhelmed Rama with an avalanche of maces and clubs. Thus the fearful and desperate conflict, causing the hair to stand on end, continued in the air and on the ground and thereafter on the summit of the mountain.", "Devas, Danavas, Yakshas, Pisacas, Uragas and Rakshasas watched the dreadful combat that lasted seven days and neither by night nor day for a single hour did Rama and Ravana cease from fighting and the son of Dasaratha and the Indra of the Titans continued to struggle thus. Then the magnanimous charioteer of the King of the Gods, beholding no sign of Raghava gaining the victory, addressed him rapidly in the following words.", "At that moment, Matali sought to recall Raghava\u2019s thoughts, saying:\u2014\u201cHow is it that you dost act in regard to Ravana as if you were unaware of thine own powers? In order to bring about his end, discharge Brahma\u2019s Weapon upon him, O Lord! Foretold by the Gods, the hour of his doom is at hand!\u201d", "Prompted by Matali, Rama took up a flaming shaft that was hissing like a viper, formerly bestowed on him by the magnanimous and powerful Sage Agastya. A gift of the Grandsire, that weapon never missed its target and it had been created of yore by Brahma for Indra and bestowed on the King of the Gods for the conquest of the Three Worlds. In its wings was the wind, in its point the fire and the sun, in its haft space, and, in size, it resembled the Mountains Meru and Mandara. With its marvellous point, haft and gilding, it was composed of the essence of all the elements and was as resplendent as the sun. Resembling the Fire of Time enveloped in smoke, it was like unto an enormous snake and was capable of riving men, elephants, horses, gateways, bars and even rocks. Dreadful to behold, covered with blood from countless victims, coated with their flesh and of the temper of lightning, it emitted a thunderous sound. The disperser of hosts, it created universal alarm, and hissing like a great serpent, it was exceedingly formidable. In war, it was the provider of nourishment to herons, vultures, cranes and hordes of jackals; it was a form of death itself, the sower of terror, the delight of the monkeys, the scourge of the titans and its wings were composed of innumerable brightly coloured plumes, like unto Garuda\u2019s.", "That marvellous and powerful shaft that was to destroy the titan was the object of terror to the worlds, the remover of the fear of the supporters of the Ikshvakus, the depriver of the glory of the foe, and it filled Rama with delight. Having charged it with the sacred formula, the valiant Rama of indescribable prowess placed that excellent weapon on his bow according to the method prescribed by the Veda and, when he made ready, all beings were seized with terror and the earth shook. Enraged, he stretched his bow with force and, deploying his whole strength, discharged that weapon, the destroyer of the vital parts, on Ravana, and that irresistible shaft like unto lightning, irrevocable as fate, loosed by the arm of one equal to the God who bears the Thunderbolt, struck Ravana\u2019s breast. Loosed with exceeding force, that missile, the supreme destroyer, pierced the breast of the wicked-hearted titan and, covered with blood, that fatal dart having extinguished his vital breaths, buried itself in the earth. Thereafter, having slain Ravana, that shaft, stained with blood which dripped therefrom, its purpose accomplished, returned submissively to the quiver.", "And Dashagriva, who had been struck down suddenly, let his bow and arrow fall from his hand as he yielded up his breath. Bereft of life, that Indra of the Nairritas of redoubtable valour and great renown, fell from his chariot as Vritra when struck by Indra\u2019s thunderbolt.", "Seeing him stretched on the ground, the rangers of the night who had escaped the carnage, struck with terror, their sovereign being slain, fled in all directions and, from every side, the monkeys who, in the presence of the dead Dashagriva had assumed a victorious air, hurled themselves upon them, armed with trees. Harassed by the monkey divisions, the titans, terror-stricken, took refuge in Lanka and, having lost their lord, in despair, gave way to tears.", "In the ranks of the monkeys, however, there arose cries of joy and shouts of triumph proclaiming Raghava\u2019s victory and Ravana\u2019s defeat, and the skies re-echoed to the music of the drums beaten by the Gods. A rain of flowers fell from heaven on to the earth, covering Raghava\u2019s chariot with a ravishing and marvellous shower of blossom. The cry of \u2018Well done! Well done!\u2019 came from the firmament and the celestial voices of the magnanimous Gods were raised in Rama\u2019s praise. On the death of that source of terror to all the worlds a great joy filled the Celestial Host as also the Caranas.", "The blessed Raghava, by slaying that Bull among the Titans, fulfilled the ambitions of Sugriva, Angada and Bibishana; peace reigned over all; the cardinal points were stilled; the air became pure, the earth ceased to tremble, the wind blew gently and the star of the day regained its full glory.", "At that instant, Sugriva, Bibishana and Angada, the foremost of his friends, and Lakshmana also, approached that happy conqueror and joyfully offered him due homage. Rama, the delight of the House of Raghu, surrounded by his adherents on the battlefield, having slain his adversary by his extraordinary power, resembled Mahendra amidst the Celestial Host.", "Seeing his brother defeated, lying on the battlefield, Bibishana, his heart torn with violent grief, began to lament, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Illustrious Warrior, you who were renowned for your skill, experience and outstanding courage, even among the valiant, O You accustomed to a luxurious couch, how is it that you are lying stiff and motionless, your long arms adorned with bracelets, stretched on the ground, having suffered your diadem, the lustre of which equals the sun, to fall on the earth? O Hero that which I predicted has come to pass I Carried away by passion, in your presumption, disregarding my counsel, this fate has overtaken Prahasta, Indrajita, Kumbhakarna, Atiratha, Atikaya, Narantaka, and you thyself. Alas! The rampart of the virtuous has disappeared, the incarnation of duty has departed, the refuge of the strong and powerful is no more. The sun has fallen to earth, the moon is obscured by darkness; fire has lost its brilliance, energy is bereft of force, since that hero, the prince of warriors, lies stretched on the earth. What remains now that he is deprived of his might and that tiger among the titans lies as if asleep in the dust? That great tree, the Lord of the Titans, whose stability was the foliage, his valour the blossom, his asceticism the sap, his heroism the intertwining roots, has been overthrown on the battlefield by that tempest, Raghava. That elephant in mustha, Ravana, his strength the tusks, his lineage the backbone, his exuberance the trunk, his wrath the limbs, has been seized by the lion, Ikshvaku. That blazing fire, whose prowess and energy are spreading flames, his angry breathing the smoke, his martial ardour the heat, has been extinguished by that cloud, Rama. That bull among the titans with the Nairritas as his tail, hump and horns, his love of pleasure the eyes and ears, he the conquerer of his foes, equal to the wind in swiftness, that tiger of the lords of the earth is lying dead.\u201d", "Hearing these words, full of good sense and virtue, uttered by Bibishana who was torn with grief, Rama addressed him saying:\u2014", "\u201cNay, this hero has not succumbed on account of his lack of prowess! Endowed with burning courage in battle, having displayed the greatest energy, he fell without yielding. One should not mourn for those who, firm in their duty as warriors, for the sake of renown fall on the field of battle. It is not the time to weep for this brave warrior, the terror of the worlds and their leaders, now that he lies under the sway of death; no one is always victorious in war; sometimes the brave succumb to the blows of the enemy and at other times it is the foe who is overcome by them. This path followed by Ravana was taught to us by the Sages and the warrior class hold it in great honour. The warrior who is slain in battle, should not be mourned, this is the law. In this conviction, do your duty without further anxiety and consider what action should now be taken.\u201d", "Then Bibishana, who was overcome with grief, instantly replied to that noble prince who had spoken to him in his brother\u2019s interest and said:\u2014", "\u201cThis valiant one who, in previous battles was never defeated even by the assembled Gods under Vasava\u2019s command, assailed by you on the field, beheld his power shattered as the ocean when coming in contact with its shores. The bestower of gifts on those who desired them, he knew how to enjoy wealth and entertain those who served him. The distributor of treasure amongst his friends, he suffered his wrath to fall on his foes. Feeding the sacred fire, he practiced severe penances, was conversant with the Veda and fulfilled his duty as a real hero. Now, with thine approval, I desire to perform his obsequies.\u201d", "Touched by these poignant words of Bibishana\u2019s, Rama commanded him to perform the funeral rites that lead the soul to heaven, and said:\u2014", "\u201cDeath has terminated our enmity that now has no reason for its existence. He is as dear to me as you; let us therefore perform the obsequies!\u201d", "Hearing that Ravana had fallen under the blows of the highly powerful Raghava, the female titans, like unto cows which have lost their calves, overcome with grief, their hair dishevelled, rushed out of the inner apartments and, though restrained, rolled in the dust again and again. Issuing from the northern gateway with their attendants, they entered that dreadful battlefield searching for their dead lord and cried out, \u2018O Our King, Our Support\u2019, running hither and thither on the ground that was covered with headless trunks, mud and gore. Their eyes full of tears, overcome with grief, they emitted cries like unto female elephants who have lost the leader of the herd.", "Then they beheld that great and exceedingly powerful and illustrious Ravana, their lord, lying in the dust and they immediately all fell upon his body like creepers that have been torn down in the forest. In a transport of passion, one embraced him sobbing, one pressed his feet, one hung on his neck, whilst another, beating the air with her arms, rolled on the ground and yet another, gazing on her dead lord, swooned away, and one, laying her head in his lap, wept as she looked on him, her tears bathing his face, as rime covers a lotus flower.", "Beholding their lord lying stretched on the earth, in their despair, they emitted continual cries of pain as their lamentations increased\u2014\u2018He of whom Shakra himself stood in awe, he who was the source of terror to Yama, he, by whom the King Vaishravana was dispossessed of his Chariot Pushpaka, he, who caused the Gandharvas, Rishis, and the magnanimous Gods to tremble, is now lying dead on the field. He had nought to fear from Asuras, Suras or Pannagas, for it was in man that the peril lay for him; he, who could not be slain by Devatas, Danavas or Rakshasas is lying here on the earth, struck down by a mere mortal fighting on foot; he, who could not be slain by Suras, Yakshas or Asuras, received his death blow from a man, as one who is defenceless.\u2019", "Thus did the wretched consorts of Ravana speak amidst their sobs and, overwhelmed with grief, continued to lament without ceasing, saying:\u2014", "\u201cNot heeding the advice of your friend, who ever offered you prudent counsel, to our destruction you didst bear Sita away and thus the titans have fallen and we shall perish this day on account of your fault. Your beloved brother, Bibishana, speaking to you in reasonable terms was publicly affronted by you in your folly, driven on, as you were by destiny; if you had returned the Princess of Mithila to Rama, this fearful and appalling disaster, that is destroying us to the very root, would never have taken place. The wishes of your brother, of Rama and of thine innumerable friends would have been fulfilled; none of us would have been widowed nor the hopes of our enemies accomplished. But, in your perversity, having retained Sita by force, the titans, we ourselves and you thyself, are all victims of a triple destruction. Nevertheless, O Bull among the Titans, it is not your passion that is the cause but destiny; all that dies is slain by destiny. This destruction of the monkeys and the titans in combat and thine own, 0 Long-armed Warrior, is the work of destiny. Neither the considerations of wealth, desire, valour nor dominion can avert the course of destiny!\u201d", "Thus the wretched consorts of the King of the Titans lamented like ospreys, overwhelmed by grief, their eyes full of tears.", "While the consorts of Ravana were lamenting thus, the foremost amongst them steadily fixed on him a tender and sorrowful glance and, in the presence of her lord, Dashagriva, who had been slain by Rama of inconceivable exploits, the unfortunate Mandodari expressed her grief in this wise:\u2014", "\u201cO Long-armed Warrior, younger brother of Vaishravana, did not Purandara himself fear to stand before you in your wrath and did not the great Rishis and the illustrious Gandharvas as also the Caranas, assailed by you, flee to every quarter? Now Rama, who is but a mortal, has defeated you in combat, you who didst surpass the Three Worlds in prowess; you whose strength rendered you invincible, how is it that you have fallen under the blows of a mere man, a wanderer in the forest? You, able to assume any form at will, living in a place inaccessible to man, how can your defeat by Rama be explained?", "\u201cNay, I do not believe that you wast thus struck down in the forefront of the battle by Rama\u2019s action, you who were ever wont to be victorious in all circumstances. Rather, having recourse to inconceivable magic, was it destiny in the form of Rama in person or it may be that it was Vasava who slew you, O Mighty Hero! But would Vasava have ventured to stand face to face with you on the battlefield in view of your great prowess and strength, you the foe of the Celestials? Assuredly it was that great Yogi, the Supreme Soul, the Eternal Spirit Who was your slayer. He who has no beginning, middle or end, the Most High, greater that Mahat (i.e., Cosmic Intellect), the Support of Nature, He Who carries the conch, the discus and the mace, Whose breast bears the Shrivatsa Mark, to Whom prosperity belongs, the invincible, indestructible, everlasting Vishnu, the true Hero assuming human form surrounded by all the Gods in monkey shapes, He, the Lord of the Worlds, has slain you, you, the enemy of the Gods, with your kinsmen and the titans who attended on you!", "\u201cFormerly, having subdued the senses, you didst conquer the Three Worlds and thereafter your senses conquered you in their turn. Rama is no mere mortal; once in Janasthana he slew your brother Khara and the innumerable titans who followed him; furthermore when Hanuman audaciously penetrated into the City of Lanka, inaccessible to the Gods themselves, we were sorely distressed. How oft did I address you, saying, \u2018Have we nought to fear from Raghava\u2019, but you didst not heed me. These are the consequences! Without cause you didst cherish a passion for Sita, O King of the Titans, to the destruction of your kingdom, life and race! By offering insult to the illustrious Sita, who surpasses Arundhati and Rohini, you didst commit an unpardonable offence! She is more patient than the earth itself, the prosperity of prosperity itself, the beloved consort of Rama, of faultless limbs, who was the splendour of the lonely forest where she dwelt. By bearing that unfortunate one away, assuming a disguise and without being able to enjoy the anticipated delight of union with Maithili, you have brought about thine own destruction 1", "\u201cO My Lord, the asceticism of that lady faithful to her husband, has consumed you 1 Since all the Gods and their leaders with Agni at their head feared you, you wast not instantly destroyed when you didst lay brutal hands on that slender-waisted lady. But, O Lord, when the time is ripe, the one who acts wickedly reaps the fruit of his evil actions; of that there is no doubt. He who behaves virtuously culls felicity and he who acts sinfully reaps ill-fortune. Bibishana has found happiness and you in the same wise has met with disaster. You didst possess other women who surpassed Maithili in beauty but in thine infatuation you didst not perceive it. None dies without a determining cause, for you it was none other than Sita. Far didst you go to seek that woman who was to be the reason of your death; now Maithili, released from all her sufferings, will rejoice with Rama. Trifling indeed is my merit, since I have fallen into this ocean of grief, I who formerly sported on Mount Kailasha, Mandara and Meru and in the woods of Caitaratha and all the gardens of the Gods with you, being adorned with marvellous garlands and jewels, roaming at large in a chariot of incomparable magnificence, beholding innumerable countries, whilst now I am deprived of all pleasures and enjoyments by your death, O Hero 1 Here am I, transformed as it were into another; condemned on account of the fluctuations of the fortunes of kings. O Prince, how gracious were you with your charming eyebrows, brilliant complexion and arched nose; you whose beauty, splendour and radiance rivalled the moon, the lotus and die sun; dazzling with innumerable diadems and variegated garlands, your red lips and brilliant earrings; handsome and pleasing, whose glances, misty with wine, roved here and there in the banqueting hall, conversing with tender smiles! Alas to-day your countenance has lost its radiance, O King, mutilated as you are by Rama\u2019s shafts, red with blood, covered with flesh and brains and soiled with the dust of chariots. Ah I the final period of my life has come; the sad state of widowhood! Wretched being that I am, I never contemplated this! \u2018My father is the King of the Danavas, my consort the Lord of the Titans, my son the Conqueror of Shakra! I have nought to fear with such protectors who crush the arrogance of their foes, who are terrible and renowned for their might and courage,\u2019 thus did I speak in my pride. With such a power as you possessed, O Bull among Titans, how has so great a disaster overtaken dice suddenly, through a mere man? You were like a marvellous sapphire, enormous, like unto a mountain and dazzling with your rings, bracelets, chains of emeralds and pearls and your flowery garlands; full of gaiety in pastimes and enjoyments. Your body, that shone with the lustre of thine ornaments, as a cloud riven with lightning, is now pierced by many arrows, ill-fitted to be embraced, without a space that is not bristling with darts, like unto an hedgehog, the muscles tom with shafts loosed with violence on your vital parts, a corpse, lying on the earth, that was formerly dark in hue and is now the colour of blood, O King I Alas! That which seemed a dream has now become a reality I How was Rama able to strike you down, you who were death to Death himself; whence comes it that you have fallen under his sway, you who enjoyed the wealth of the Three Worlds whom you didst inspire with a lively fear; you who conquered the Guardians of the Worlds, who overcame Shankara with your shafts, who didst humble the proud and manifest your great prowess. You who didst trouble the universe, the scourge of the virtuous, whose strength inspired you to utter insolent threats in the enemy\u2019s presence; you the support of your family and thine attendants, the slayer of redoubtable warriors, you who exterminated the leaders of the Danavas and Yakshas in their thousands, you who triumphed in the fight over those wearing impenetrable armour, you who many a time obstructed the sacrifices, you the saviour of your race, who set at nought the laws of duty, who took refuge in the power of magic in battle, who robbed the Gods, Asuras and men of their daughters from here and there and who didst plunge the wives of your foes into mourning; you, the guide of your people, who ruled over the Island of Lanka, you the perpetrator of dreadful deeds, you who didst prepare for us many a pleasure and enjoyment, you the foremost of warriors; beholding you, O Lord, who despite your great powers, hast been struck down by Rama, my heart must be hard indeed that I yet live bereft of you, my Beloved. Having rested on sumptuous couches, O King of the Titans, how is it that you are now sleeping on the earth, the dust your coverlet?", "\u201cWhen mine illustrious son Indrajita was struck down by Lakshmana in the fight, I was deeply distressed but to-day I am undone, I, who, already bereft of parents and kinsfolk, now lose my last support in you! Deprived of pleasure and enjoyments, now that you have left on the last journey from which none returns, O King, I shall waste away in your perpetual remembrance. I cannot live without you; take me with you; why dost you leave me in my misery? Art you vexed to see me unveiled who have crossed the city boundary to run here on foot, O Lord? Look on your cherished consorts who have discarded their veils; seeing them all come forth from the city, art you displeased? This company, with whom you didst disport thyself, is desolate, deprived of its leader and you dost not comfort them. Hast you no reverence for us? Those women whom you have widowed, 0 King, and more than one was of noble lineage, who were devoted to their consorts, firm in their duty and submissive to their Gurus, in their grief have cursed you and, on this account, you have fallen under the blows of thine adversary. Stricken by you, they have cursed you and this is the retribution 1 O King, the truth of the saying, The tears of women devoted to their husbands do not fall on the earth in vain\u2019, has been proven by you! How comes it, O King, that you, who didst surpass all the worlds in valour, were so base as to carry off this woman, having lured Rama from the hermitage with the aid of an illusory deer? In the intoxication of your strength you didst bear away Rama\u2019s consort after separating her from Lakshmana, and yet, if I reflect carefully, you were never a faint-hearted warrior! This is the manifest proof of the changeability of fortune. Conversant with the past and future and reflecting on the present, that long-armed warrior, my truthful brother-in-law (i.e., Bibhishana), seeing Maithili, whom you had borne away, sighing deeply, told me what had taken place. The destruction of the foremost of the titans has been brought about by this infatuation which was the source of your lust and anger. You didst sacrifice your real interests to this violent appetite that destroys everything to its very roots and, by this action, the whole titan race is deprived of its leader.", "\u201cNay, I should not weep for you, though famed for your strength and valour but my woman\u2019s nature inclines my heart to compassion. Bearing with you the sum of that which you have done, be it good or ill, you have gone to the place for which you were destined; it is for myself I should lament, I who am plunged in affliction by your loss.", "\u201cYou didst not give ear to your friends who desired your welfare and, though exceedingly sagacious, you didst ignore the counsels of your brothers, O Ten-necked One. Bibishana\u2019s words so full of reason, that were measured, prudent, salutory and affectionate were not heeded by you despite their significance. Drunk with thine own power, the utterances of Marica, Kumbhakarna and of your sire also, were not acceptable to you; behold the consequences!", "\u201cO You who resemblest a dark doud in hue, who art clothed in yellow, wearing dazzling bracelets, why are your limbs stiff and covered with blood? You feignest sleep; why dost you not answer me who am overcome with grief? Why dost you not speak to me, the daughter of the supremely powerful Yatudhana Sumali, who never retreated in battle? Rise! Rise I Why dost you remain lying there in the face of this fresh insult? To-day the rays of the sun fall on Lanka without fear. Your mace, that brilliant weapon encircled with gold, like unto Surya, with which you didst exterminate your foes in battle, resembling the thunderbolt of Indra, which you didst wield at your whim to the destruction of the many on the battlefield, now lies shattered in a thousand pieces by Rama\u2019s arrows. Why dost you lie embracing the earth like a loved one? How is it that you dost not address a word to me as if I were no longer your beloved?", "\u201cWoe unto me, whose heart did not split into a thousand pieces, riven by grief, when you didst return to the five elements!\u201d", "Thus did Mandodari lament, her eyes full of tears; and thereafter her heart overflowing with love, she swooned away, falling unconscious on Ravana\u2019s breast, like a flash of lightning striking a crimson cloud at dusk. Thereupon her companions, distressed, raised up her who was lamenting and placing her in their midst, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Queen, art you not conversant with the uncertainty of fate in this world and how, in a moment, the fortune of kings may change?\u201d", "To these words, Mandodari replied with sobs and cries, her pure and lovely face and her breast bathed in tears.", "Then Rama said to Bibishana:\u2014", "\u201cProceed with the obsequies of your brother and offer consolation to his wives!\u201d", "Thereafter the sagacious Bibishana, having reflected within himself, made this answer that was discreet, reasoned and in conformity with duty and understanding, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI cannot perform the funeral rites for one who failed to fulfil his responsibilities and his vows, who was cruel, ruthless and disloyal; a ravisher of others wives! Under the guise of a brother he was mine enemy and took pleasure in inflicting injury; Ravana does not merit this homage! The world may say of me \u2018he was a barbarian but when they learn of Ravana\u2019s wicked deeds, everyone will approve my conduct.\u201d", "Thus did he speak, and Rama, full of joy, the foremost of those who are firm in their duty, answered Bibishana, who was skilled in speech, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI seek your welfare, since with thine aid I have been victorious, nevertheless it is essential that I should utter what is fitting, O Chief of the Titans 1 Though unjust and wicked, this nightranger was ever energetic, valiant and courageous in war. It is said that the Gods with Shatakratu at their head were not able to overcome him. He was magnanimous and powerful, this oppressor of the worlds. Death brings enmity to an end; we have accomplished our purpose, let us perform the obsequies; it is meet for me, as well as for you, to do so. In accord with tradition, this ceremony should take place in your presence. Perform this pious act speedily, you will receive much glory therefrom.\u201d", "At these words of Raghava, Bibishana hastened to carry out the funeral rites.", "Entering the City of Lanka, that Indra among the Titans, Bibishana, began to prepare for the Agnihotra Ceremony in honour of his brother. Carts, wood of varying essences, fire, utensils, sandal, logs of every kind, fragrant gums, perfumes, cloths, jewels, pearls and coral were all assembled by him and he soon returned surrounded by titans, whereupon, accompanied by Malyavan (i.e., The brother of Sumali), he initiated the sacrifice.", "Having placed Ravana, the supreme Lord of the Titans, wrapped in linen cloths on a golden bier, the Twice-born with Bibishana at their head, their eyes suffused with tears, raised the litter decorated with many fragrant and divine symbols to the sound of innumerable musical instruments and fimeral chants, and all, turning their faces towards the south, took up pieces of wood which had been distributed among them.", "Then the brahmins, versed in the Yajur Veda, bearing flaming brands went forward and those who had taken refuge with them, and the women of the inner apartments followed sobbing with tottering steps, running hither and thither. And Ravana was placed in a spacious ground, amidst profound lamentation, and a great pyre was built with pieces of Sandal and Padmaka Wood and grass, according to tradition; and he was covered with antelope skins.", "Thereafter, in honour of the King of the Titans, a rare offering was made to the ancestors and the altar was installed to the south-west with the sacred fire in its proper place. Then curd and clarified butter were poured on Ravana\u2019s shoulder and a wooden mortar placed at his feet with one between his thighs; vessels of wood and the lower and upper kindling sticks, with a spare pestle, were set there according to the prescribed rules. Now the titans sacrificed a goat in honour of their king, according to tradition, as taught by the great Rishis, and, having dipped a cloth in butter, they covered the face of their sovereign, who was adorned with garlands and sprinkled with perfumes. Thereafter Bibishana\u2019s companions, their faces bathed in tears, covered the body with cloths and every kind of roasted grain, whereupon Bibishana kindled the pyre according to the sacred rites and, having laved him with a cloth which had been previously wetted with water and mingled with linseed and sacrificial grass, he bowed down to him; then he addressed the consorts of Ravana again and again in order to console them, finally entreating them to return home. And when they had all reentered the City of Lanka, that Indra among the Titans took up his place by Rama in an attitude of reverence.", "Rama, however, with his army, Sugriva and Lakshmana, rejoiced at the death of his enemy, as the God who bears the Thunderbolt on the destruction of Vritra.", "Having laid aside the arrows and bow that Mahendra had bestowed upon him as also the massive armour, Rama, the slayer of his foes, renounced his wrath, his adversary having been subdued, and once more assumed a gentle mien.", "Having witnessed the death of Ravana, the Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas mounted their respective chariots, discoursing on these matters. Conversing of Ravana\u2019s fearful end, the heroism of Raghava, the courageous fighting of the monkeys, the great valour of Maruti and Lakshmana and Sita\u2019s fidelity to her lord, those blessed ones returned joyfully from whence they had come.", "Raghava, however, sent back the celestial chariot blazing like a flame that Indra had lent him and took leave of Matali after offering his thanks to him. Then Shakra\u2019s charioteer, dismissed by the mighty Rama, mounting his celestial car, ascended into the sky.", "Matali having returned to heaven in his chariot, Raghava, the foremost of car-warriors, in the height of felicity, embraced Sugriva and, having done so, accepted Lakshmana\u2019s homage and returned to the camp amidst the acclamations of the monkey ranks.", "Thereafter Kakutstha addressed the son of Sumitra, the devoted Lakshmana, the bearer of auspicious marks, who stood near him and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Friend, install Bibishana as King of Lanka! On account of his loyalty, his zeal and the service he formerly rendered to us, my greatest desire is to see Bibishana, the younger brother of Ravana enthroned in Lanka, O Dear One.\u201d", "At these words from the magnanimous Raghava, Saumitri, full of joy, said:\u2014\u201cSo be it!\u201d and speedily took up a golden jar which he placed in the hands of the foremost of monkeys. Thereafter that warrior commanded water to be drawn from the four seas and the monkeys went there in all haste and, having drawn water from the oceans, returned as swiftly as thought.", "Then Saumitri, at Rama\u2019s command, lifting up an excellent jar, caused Bibishana to take his place on a high seat and, following the injunctions laid down in the sacred texts, surrounded by a crowd of his friends, with that water installed him as King of Lanka amidst the titans.", "All the monkeys as well as the titans assisted at Bibishana\u2019s installation and, amidst unequalled transports of delight, they paid tribute to Rama. Bibishana\u2019s counsellors were exceedingly happy, as also the titans who were devoted to him and, being enthroned as King of Lanka, he, Raghava and Lakshmana, who accompanied him, experienced supreme satisfaction. Then the new monarch, having spoken graciously to his subjects, went to where Rama was to be found.", "Thereafter the people of the city offered him curds, parched rice, sweetmeats, roasted grain and flowers, which he placed at the disposal of Rama and Lakshmana, and Raghava, seeing Bibishana\u2019s work accomplished and his purpose attained, accepted all in deference to him.", "Then Rama addressed the valiant Hanuman, who resembled a mountain, as he stood before him with bowed head and joined palms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWith the approval of the great King Bibishana, O My Friend, do you re-enter Lanka and enquire for Maithili. Say to Vaidehi that I am well, as also Sugriva and Lakshmana. O Most Eloquent of Speakers, tell her of the death of Ravana on the field of battle. Impart these agreeable tidings to Vaidehi, O Prince of the Monkeys, and having received her commands, return!\u201d", "Thus commanded, Hanuman, born of Maruta, returned to Lanka overwhelmed with honours by the rangers of the night and, entering the city invested with Bibishana\u2019s authority which he had sought, Hanuman penetrated to the Ashoka Grove, knowing that Sita was to be found there.", "There he beheld Maithili like an anguished Rohini, uncared for, sitting sorrowfully at the foot of a tree surrounded by female titans and, approaching her humbly and gently, Hanuman inclined his head in obeisance to her.", "At the appearance of the mighty Hanuman, that Goddess remained silent, but thereafter, having recognized him, she was delighted, and marking her tranquil looks, Hanuman the foremost of monkeys, prepared to relate all that Rama had said:\u2014", "\u201cO Vaidehi, Rama is well as also Sugriva and Lakshmana; he enquires as to your welfare! His purpose is accomplished, he, the conquerer of his foes has slain his adversary. Assisted by Bibishana and the monkeys, Rama, with the skill and wisdom of Lakshmana, has slain Ravana despite his prowess, O Goddess! These are pleasant tidings but I will delight you still further, O Divinity. In this war, undertaken on thine account, O Virtuous Sita, Rama has achieved a great triumph! Take heart therefore, have no further anxiety; Ravana is dead and Lanka subdued. Banishing sleep, I resolved to deliver you and bridging the sea fulfilled my vow. Do not fear now to be in Ravana\u2019s abode since Bibishana has become the Lord of Lanka. Because of this, take courage, you canst dwell peacefully in the palace; Rama himself is coming hither with a joyful step eager to see you.\u201d", "At these tidings, the divine Sita, her face radiant as the moon on account of joy, was unable to utter a single word and that prince of monkeys enquired of Sita, who remained silent, saying:\u2014", "\u201cOf what art you thinking, O Goddess, since you dost not answer me?\u201d", "Thus interrogated by Hanuman, Sita, fixed in the path of duty, in the height of joy, said in a voice broken with sobs:\u2014", "\u201cHearing these pleasant tidings of the triumph of my lord, for a moment joy rendered me speechless. Nay, assuredly, reflecting on it, O Plavamgama, I do not know what gift I can offer you which would be equal to this! I know nothing on earth comparable to these happy tidings or with what I can recompense you fittingly. Gold, precious gems of every kind, even a throne or any object in the Three Worlds cannot be measured against your message 1\u201d", "At these words of Vaidehi, the monkey, standing before her with joined palms, joyfully replied:\u2014", "\u201cO You who art ever engaged in what is pleasant and advantageous to your Lord and who desirest him to be victorious, thine affectionate speech confers honour on you, O Irreproachable Lady.\u201d", "Hearing this, Maithili, the daughter of Janaka addressed these flattering words to the Son of the Wind:\u2014", "\u201cYour speech which is characteristic, urbane and dictated by the eight-fold intelligence is worthy of you. You, the exceedingly virtuous son of Anila art deserving of praise! Assuredly strength, prowess, knowledge of the scriptures, courage, boldness, superior skill, energy, endurance, steadiness, constancy and humility, these brilliant qualities and many others are all to be found in you!\u201d", "Unmoved by this praise, Hanuman, standing before her with joined palms, addressed Sita respectfully and said:\u2014", "\u201cWith your consent I will slay all those female titans who formerly taunted you in your misfortune, O You whose lord is a god. I know that those monsters of hideous shape and conduct, those cruel beings of savage looks, those grim-visaged titans, more than once addressed you in threatening tones at Ravana\u2019s command. Grant me permission to strike down those barbarians of distorted features and fearful aspect. I shall beat them with my fists, heels, long arms, thighs and knees; I shall tear them to pieces with my teeth, chew up their ears, pull out their hair, knock them down and destroy them, since they have caused you pain, O Illustrious Princess! I shall exterminate those monsters who formerly insulted you.\u201d", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s words, the unfortunate Sita, friend of the distressed, reflecting carefully, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cWho would be angry with women, who are dependent on a monarch who is their supporter, and who act on other\u2019s advice as mere servants or slaves, O Excellent Monkey? All that has happened to me is on account of an evil fate and the consequence of some fault committed formerly. One reaps the fruit of one\u2019s actions. Do not speak thus, 0 Long-armed Warrior, the path of destiny is inexorable! It was inevitable that these circumstances should overtake me and, in this conviction, I wish in compassion to protect the slaves of Ravana. It was under the orders of that titan that these women ill-treated me. He being slain, they will no longer oppress me, O Son of Maruta. There is an ancient saying full of wisdom which a bear uttered formerly in the presence of a tiger, hear it, O Plavamgama!", "\u201c\u2018A superior being does not render evil for evil, this is a maxim one should observe; the ornament of virtuous persons is their conduct. One should never harm the wicked or the good or even criminals meriting death. A noble soul will ever exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or those of cruel deeds when they are actually committing them, who is without fault?\u2019\u201d", "Hearing these words, Hanuman, who was skilled in speech, said to Sita, the irreproachable consort of Rama:\u2014", "\u201cYou are worthy of Raghava, you, his chaste wife crowned with many virtues. O Goddess, command me to seek out Rama!\u201d", "On this, Vaidehi born of Janaka, said: -", "\u201cI desire to see my lord, the friend of his devotees!\u201d", "Hearing her speak thus, Hanuman, the exceedingly intelligent son of Maruta made this reply to Maithili, causing that princess great delight", "\u201cThis day shalt you see Rama, whose countenance resembles the full moon, with Lakshmana and his trusted friends, his enemies slain, as Saci looks upon Indra, the King of the Gods.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Sita, who was as radiant as Shri herself, the exceedingly valiant Hanuman immediately departed to rejoin Raghava. Without delay, the foremost of monkeys, Hanuman, repeated the words that the daughter of Janaka had uttered, in their proper sequence to Rama who was the equal of the Chief of the Gods.", "That highly intelligent monkey, having paid obeisance to Rama, whose eyes resembled the petals of a lotus, the most skilled of archers, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cIt behoves you to visit Maithili who is consumed with grief and on account of whom this enterprise, that has been crowned with success, was undertaken. In the distress that overwhelms her, Maithili, her eyes bathed in tears, hearing of your victory, expressed a desire to behold you once more. Confiding in me formerly, her glances warm with emotion, she repeated \u2018I desire to see my lord again!\u2019\u201d", "These words of Hanuman instantly evoked thoughts in Rama, the first of men, causing him to shed tears. Sighing deeply, he said to Bibishana standing near, who resembled a cloud:\u2014", "\u201cBring the Princess of Videha, Sita, hither, anointed with celestial unguents, adorned with heavenly jewels, having laved her head; do not delay!\u201d", "At these words of Rama, Bibishana hastened to the private apartments to fetch Sita with her attendants. Beholding the unfortunate Maithili, Bibishana, the powerful King of the Titans, paid obeisance to her, raising his joined palms to his forehead, and respectfully addressed her, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Vaidehi, sprinkle thyself with celestial unguents, adorn thyself with divine ornaments and ascend this palanquin! May happiness attend you! Your lord desires to see you!\u201d", "Then Vaidehi answered Bibishana who had addressed her thus, saying:\u2014\u201cWithout having bathed, I wish to see my consort, O Bibishana.\u201d", "Hearing this, Bibishana replied:\u2014\u201cIt behoves you to do what Rama commands!\u201d Whereto the virtuous Maithili, who regarded her husband as a god, filled with conjugal duty, said:\u2014\u2018Be it so!\u2019", "Thereupon Sita, her tresses waved, adorned with priceless ornaments, wearing gorgeous raiment, ascended a palanquin borne by those titans accustomed to do so, accompanied by a large escort under Bibishana\u2019s command.", "And Bibishana approaching that magnanimous hero, who was merged in meditation, bowing down to him, joyfully announced Sita\u2019s arrival.", "Hearing that his consort, who had dwelt long in the titan\u2019s abode, had come, rage, joy and grief overwhelmed Raghava, the slayer of his foes and, beholding Sita in the palanquin, Rama, in order to test her, dissembling his happiness, said to Bibishana:\u2014", "\u201cO Supreme Lord of the Titans, O My Friend who ever rejoiced in my victories, bring Vaidehi nearer to me.\u201d", "At Raghava\u2019s command, the righteous Bibishana caused the crowd to disperse, whereupon titans clad in armour, wearing turbans, with drums and bamboo staves in their hands began to move about driving away the warriors, bears, monkeys and titans, who, scattering, stood apart some way off. And as they were being driven away, a tremendous clamour arose resembling the roar of the sea buffeted by the winds.", "Seeing them dispersing, whilst confusion was created amongst them, Rama in affection for them, grew indignant at their departure and, highly incensed, with a glance that seemed as if it would consume him, addressed the exceedingly intelligent Bibishana in terms of reproach, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhy, disregarding me, dost you harass them, are they not my people? Her conduct, not raiment, walls, seclusion or other royal prohibitions, are a woman\u2019s shield. In times of calamity, peril, war, the Svyamvara or the nuptual ceremony, it is not forbidden to behold a woman unveiled. It is not prohibited to look upon a woman who has fallen into distress and difficulty, above all in my presence. Therefore, leaving the palanquin, let Vaidehi come hither on foot so that the dwellers in the woods may see her at my side.\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words, Bibishana became thoughtful and conducted Sita to him reverently, whilst Lakshmana, Sugriva and also Hanuman, hearing Rama speak thus, were saddened.", "Then Maithili, confused and shrinking within herself, approached her lord accompanied by Bibishana; and it was with astonishment, delight and love that Sita, whose husband was a god, gazed on Rama\u2019s gracious appearance, she whose own face was still beautiful. Beholding the countenance of her dearly loved lord, whom she had not seen for so long and which was as radiant as the full moon when it rises, she cast aside all anxiety and her own face became as fair as the immaculate orb of the night.", "Beholding Maithili standing humbly beside him, Rama gave expression to the feelings he had conceded in his heart, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Illustrious Princess, I have re-won you and mine enemy has been defeated on the battlefield; I have accomplished all that fortitude could do; my wrath is appeased; the insult and the one who offered it have both been obliterated by me. To-day my prowess has been manifested, to-day mine exertions have been crowned with success, to-day I have fulfilled my vow and am free. As ordained by destiny the stain of your separation and thine abduction by that fickle-minded titan has been expunged by me, a mortal. Of what use is great strength to the vacillating, who do not with resolution avenge the insult offered to them?", "\u201cTo-day Hanuman is plucking the fruit of his glorious exploits, and Sugriva, who is valiant in war and wise in counsel, with his army is reaping the harvest of his exertions! Bibishana too is culling the fruits of his labours, he who cast off a brother, who was devoid of virtue, to come to me.\u201d", "When Sita heard Rama speak in this wise, her large doe-like eyes filled with tears and, beholding the beloved of his heart standing close to him, Rama, who was apprehensive of public rumour, was torn within himself. Then, in the presence of the monkeys and the titans, he said to Sita, whose eyes were as large as lotus petals, her dark hair plaited, and who was endowed with faultless limbs:\u2014", "\u201cWhat a man should do in order to wipe out an insult, I have done by slaying Ravana for I guard mine honour jealously! You were re-won as the southern region, inaccessible to man, was re-gained by the pure-souled Agastya through his austerities. Be happy and let it be known that this arduous campaign, so gloriously terminated through the support of my friends, was not undertaken wholly for your sake. I was careful to wipe out the affront paid to me completely and to avenge the insult offered to mine illustrious House.", "\u201cA suspicion has arisen, however, with regard to your conduct, and your presence is as painful to me as a lamp to one whose eye is diseased! Henceforth go where it best pleases you, I give you leave, O Daughter of Janaka. 0 Lovely One, the ten regions are at your disposal; I can have nothing more to do with you! What man of honour would give rein to his passion so far as to permit himself to take back a woman who has dwelt in the house of another? You have been taken into Ravana\u2019s lap and he has cast lustful glances on you; how can I reclaim you, I who boast of belonging to an illustrious House? The end which I sought in re-conquering you has been gained; I no longer have any attachment for you; go where you desirest! This is the outcome of my reflections, O Lovely One! Turn to Lakshmana or Bharata, Shatrughna, Sugriva or the Titan Bibishana, make your choice, O Sita, as pleases you best. Assuredly Ravana, beholding your ravishing and celestial beauty, will not have respected your person during the time that you didst dwell in his abode.\u201d", "On this, that noble lady, worthy of being addressed in sweet words, hearing that harsh speech from her beloved lord, who for long had surrounded her with every homage, wept bitterly, and she resembled a creeper that has been tom away by the trunk of a great elephant.", "[Full title: Sita\u2019s Lamentations; She undergoes the Ordeal by Fire].", "Hearing these harsh words from the wrathful Raghava, causing her to tremble, those fearful utterances, which till that time had never been heard by her and were now addressed to her by her lord in the presence of a great multitude, Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, overwhelmed with shame, pierced to the heart by that arrow-like speech, shed abundant tears. Thereafter, wiping her face, she addressed her husband in gentle and faltering accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhy dost you address such words to me, O Hero, as a common man addresses an ordinary woman? I swear to you, O Long-armed Warrior, that my conduct is worthy of your respect! It is the behaviour of other women that has filled you with distrust! Relinquish your doubts since I am known to you! If my limbs came in contact with another\u2019s, it was against my will, O Lord, and not through any inclination on my part; it was brought about by fate. That which is under my control, my heart, has ever remained faithful to you; my body was at the mercy of another; not being mistress of the situation, what could I do? If despite the proofs of love that I gave you whilst I lived with you, I am still a stranger to you, O Proud Prince, my loss is irrevocable!", "\u201cWhen, in Lanka, you didst dispatch the great warrior Hanuman to seek me out, why didst you not repudiate me then? As soon as I had received the tidings that I had been abandoned by you, I should have yielded up my life in the presence of that monkey, O Hero! Then you wouldst have been spared useless fatigue on mine account and others lives would not have been sacrificed, nor thine innumerable friends exhausted to no purpose. But you, O Lion among Men, by giving way to wrath and by thus passing premature judgement on a woman, hast acted like a worthless man.", "\u201cI have received my name from Janaka, but my birth was from the earth and you have failed to appreciate fully the nobility of my conduct, O You who are well acquainted with the nature of others. You have had no reverence for the joining of our hands in my girlhood and mine affectionate nature, all these things hast you cast behind you!\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Rama, weeping the while, her voice strangled with sobs, Sita addressed the unfortunate Lakshmana, who was overwhelmed with grief, saying:\u2014", "\u201cRaise a pyre for me, O Saumitri, this is the only remedy for my misery! These unjust reproaches have destroyed me, I cannot go on living! Publicly renounced by mine husband, who is insensible to my virtue, there is only one redress for me, to undergo the ordeal by fire!\u201d", "Hearing Vaidehi\u2019s words, Lakshmana, the slayer of hostile warriors, a prey to indignation, consulted Raghava with his glance and by Rama\u2019s gestures he understood what was in his heart, whereupon the valiant Saumitri, following his indications, prepared the pyre.", "None amongst his friends dared to appeal to Rama, who resembled Death himself, the Destroyer of Time; none dared to speak or even to look upon him.", "Thereafter Vaidehi, having circumambulated Rama, who stood with his head bowed, approached the blazing fire and, paying obeisance to the Celestials and brahmins, Maithili, with joined palms, standing before the flames, spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cAs my heart has never ceased to be true to Raghava, do you, O Witness of all Beings, grant me your protection! Aslam pure in conduct, though Rama looks on me as sullied, do you, O Witness of the Worlds, grant me full protection!\u201d", "With these words, Vaidehi circumambulated the pyre and with a fearless heart entered the flames.", "And a great multitude were assembled there, amongst which were many children and aged people 'who witnessed Maithili entering the fire. And, resembling gold that has been melted in the crucible, she threw herself into the blazing flames in the presence of all. That large-eyed lady, entering the fire, who is the Bearer of Sacrificial Offerings, appeared to those who watched her to resemble a golden altar. That fortunate princess entering the fire, which is nourished by oblations, seemed, in the eyes of the Rishis, Devas and Gandharvas, to resemble a sacrificial offering.", "Then all the women cried out:\u2014\u2018Alas!\u2019 on seeing her, like a stream of butter hallowed by the recitation of mantras, fall into the flames, and she appeared to the Three Worlds, the Gods, the Gandharvas and the Danavas like a goddess smitten by a curse and cast down from heaven into hell. Then, as she entered the flames, a great and terrible cry rose from the titans and the monkeys.", "Meanwhile the righteous Rama, hearing the lamentation of the masses, afflicted, pondered awhile and his eyes filled with tears.", "Then the King Vaishravana and Yama with the Pitris, the Thousand-eyed Lord of the Celestials, Varuna, Lord of the Waters and Mahadeva the blessed Three-eyed God who rides the Bull, as also Brahma the Creator of the World, King of the Learned, all gathered together, having hastened there in their chariots as bright as the sun, coming to the City of Lanka to seek out Rama.", "Lifting up their great arms and hands adorned with jewels, they made obeisance with joined palms and the King of the Gods addressing Raghava, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Creator of the Universe and foremost of those versed in the spiritual science, how canst you manifest indifference to Sita falling into the flames?

The Twin Ashvins are your two ears, the sun and moon thine eyes; these are the forms at the beginning, middle and end of creation in which you dost appear, O Scourge of Your Foes; and yet you dost distrust Vaidehi as if you were an ordinary man 1\u201d", "Thus addressed by the Protector of the Worlds, the Leader of the Gods, Raghava, Lord of Peoples, Foremost of the Pious, answered:\u2014", "\u201cI deem myself to be a man, Rama, born of Dasaratha; who then am I in reality? From whence have I come? Let the Grandsire of the World inform me 1\u201d", "Thus spoke Kakutstha and Brahma, foremost of those who know the truth, addressed him saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou are the great and effulgent God Narayana, the fortunate Lord armed with the discus. You are the One-Tusked Boar, the Conqueror of your Foes in the past and the future. You are the imperishable Brahman, Existence Itself, transcending the three divisions of time; You are the Law of Righteousness, the Four-armed, the Bearer of the Sharnga Bow; You are the Subduer of the senses, the Supreme Purusha; You are invincible, You are the Holder of the Dagger, You are Vishnu, You are Krishna and of immeasurable might; You are Senani and Gramani, the Controller of passions, the Origin and Dissolution; You are Upendra and die Slayer of the Demon Madhu, You are the Creator of Indra and Indra Himself; You are the Lotus-navelled One; You dost bring combat to an end.

None knows thine origin or end or who You really art. You are manifest in all beings, in the cows and the brahmins; You pervadest all regions, the firmament, the mountains and the rivers, You, the Thousand-footed God, the Thousand-headed One, You of a Thousand Eyes! You are the support of all beings and the earth. When the earth is withdrawn, under the form of a great serpent, You dost appear on the waters supporting all the worlds and the Gods, Gandharvas and Danavas, O Rama. I am your heart and the Goddess Sarasvati, your tongue; the Gods are the hairs of Your body, I, Brahma created them thus. When You dost close thine eyes, it is night and when You dost open them, it is day. The Vedas are Your Samskaras (i.e., Latent Impressions); nothing exists apart from you; the whole universe is Your body, the earth Your forbearance; Agni Your wrath, Soma Your beneficence, the Shrivatsa Mark, Your holy symbol.", "\u201cYou didst cover the Three Worlds in three strides; You didst bind the terrible Bali and establish Mahendra as King.

This task that we entrusted to You has been accomplished, O You, the foremost of those who observe their duty. Ravana having fallen, do You ascend to heaven joyfully I Your might is irresistible, O Rama, and thine exploits are never fruitless. To behold You and offer adoration to You is never unprofitable! It is not in vain that men are devoted to You on earth. Those who are ever faithful to You, attain to You who art the primeval Purusha and their desires will be fulfilled in this world and the other worlds. Those who recite this eternal, ancient and traditional theme, transmitted by the Rishis, will never suffer defeat.\u201d", "Hearing those excellent words uttered by the Grandsire, Vibhabasu, who bore Vaidehi in his lap, having extinguished the pyre, rose up, and that Bearer of Sacrificial Offerings, assuming a corporeal form, stood up and took hold of the daughter of Janaka. Then that youthful woman, beautiful as the dawn, wearing ornaments of refined gold, attired in a red robe, having dark and curly hair, wearing fresh garlands, the irreproachable Vaidehi was restored to Rama by the God of Fire.", "Thereafter the Witness of the whole world, Pavaka, addressed Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHere is Vaidehi, O Rama, there is no sin in her! Neither by word, feeling or glance has your lovely consort shown herself to be unworthy of your noble qualities. Separated from you, that unfortunate one was borne away against her will in the lonely forest by Ravana, who had grown proud on account of his power. Though imprisoned and closely guarded by titan women in the inner apartments, you wast ever the focus of her thoughts and her supreme hope. Surrounded by hideous and sinister women, though tempted and threatened, Maithili never gave place in her heart to a single thought for that titan and was solely absorbed in you. She is pure and without taint, do you receive Maithili; it is my command that she should not suffer reproach in any way.\u201d", "These words filled Rama\u2019s heart with delight and he, the most eloquent of men, that loyal soul, reflected an instant within himself, his glance full of joy.

Ravana was no more able to influence that large-eyed lady, whose chastity was her own protection, than the ocean may pass beyond its bournes. Despite his great perversity, he was unable to approach Maithili even in thought, who was inaccessible to him as a flame. That virtuous woman could never belong to any other than myself for she is to me what the light is to the sun. Her purity is manifest in the Three Worlds; I could no more renounce Maithili, born of Janaka than a hero his honour. It behoves me to follow your wise and friendly counsel, O Gracious Lords of the World.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, the victorious and extremely powerful Rama, full of glory, adored for his noble exploits, was re-united with his beloved and experienced the felicity he had merited.", "Hearing those excellent words uttered by Raghava, Maheshvara addressed him with even greater eloquence, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lotus-eyed One, O You the possessor of long arms and a broad chest, O Scourge of Your foes, fortunate it is that you have accomplished this great feat, O Most Pious of Men 1", "\u201cO Rama, it is well for all beings that you have dispelled this deep and dreadful darkness of the whole world, this fear created by Ravana.

And you, Bibishana, occupy the throne of Lanka that I have conferred upon you. Even the inhabitants of heaven and their chiefs will not be able to trouble you.

Angada struck down the Titans named Vikata and Virupaksha, hideous to look upon, as also Mahaparshva and Mahodara. Akampana succumbed, as also other valiant warriors, Trishiras, Atikaya, Devantaka and Narantaka, Yuddhonmatta and Matta, both great heroes, Nikumbha and Kumbha, the two sons of Kumbhakama, who were full of courage; Vajradamshtra, Damshtra and innumerable other titans perished here and the invincible Maharaksha whom I slew in combat; and Akampana was slain and the powerful Shonitaksha whilst Yupaksha and Prajangha also succumbed in the great struggle. Vidyujjihva, a titan of fearful aspect fell there and Yajnashatru died also; the mighty Suptaghna too, as also Suryashatru, were slain with Brahma-shatru, who had no equal, and here Mandodari\u2019s consort, for whom she wept surrounded by her companions to the number of a thousand or more.", "\u201cHere is the place where the ocean was traversed, O Lady of Lovely Looks, and, having passed over the sea, there is the spot where the night was spent.

O Maithili, behold that golden mountain, which, cleaving the waves, rose out of the bosom of the deep in order to allow Hanuman to rest. And here, our headquarters were established; here, formerly the Lord Mahadeva granted me a boon and there is the sacred and purifying spot known as Setubandha where even the greatest sins are washed away.

Your desire shall be realised immediately!\u201d Then the trees of that region instantly resembled those of Paradise. Those that had none, grew fruits, and those that had no flowers were covered with blossom; trees that had withered were enveloped with foliage and all dripped with honey for three leagues along the way.", "Meanwhile the foremost of the monkeys regaled themselves on those celestial fruits to the extent of their desire and, transported with joy, imagined they had entered heaven.", "When he beheld Ayodhya, that descendant of Raghu of rapid step full of magnanimity, gave himself up to pleasant thoughts and, having reflected awhile, that fortunate and illustrious hero said to the monkey, Hanuman:\u2014", "\u201cHasten with all speed to Ayodhya, O Foremost of Monkeys, and ascertain if all are happy in the royal palace.

When he hears that I am safe and well, freed from all anxieties, he will be content, for he is my second self and my friend. He will gladly show you the way to Ayodhya and give you tidings of Bharata. Do you enquire of Bharata as to his well-being and inform him that I have returned with my consort and Lakshmana, my mission accomplished.

Tell him of our arrival on the shores of the sea, the appearance of Sagara and how the causeway was constructed; how Ravana perished; of the boons bestowed on me by Mahendra, Brahma and Varuna and, by the favour of Mahadeva, the meeting with my Sire. Inform Bharata, O My Friend, that I am coming accompanied by King Bibishana and the Lord of the Monkeys. Say to him, \u2018Having overcome the army of the enemy and attained a glory without parallel, Rama, his purpose accomplished, is approaching with his valiant friends Do you carefully observe the expression on the face of Bharata when he hears these tidings and how he comports himself. You will know all by his gestures, the colour of his face, his glances and his words. Whose mind would not be moved by the thought of (ascending) an ancestral throne, fulfilling all one\u2019s dreams, and to a kingdom abounding in prosperity, hosts of elephants, horses and chariots? If the fortunate Bharata wishes to reign in his own right, then, by mutual agreement, let that descendant of Raghu govern the entire earth!\u201d", "On receiving these instructions, Hanuman, born of Maruta, assuming human form, left in all haste for Ayodhya and advanced with speed, like unto Garuda swooping on a great serpent on which he wishes to lay hold. Traversing the path-way of his sire, the shining abode of great birds and, crossing over the formidable confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna, he reached the City of Shringavera. Then the valiant Hanuman sought out Guha and said to him, his voice ringing with joy:\u2014", "\u201cYour friend, Kakutstha, that true hero who is accompanied by Sita as also Saumitri, enquires as to your welfare.

Having journeyed a great distance that foremost of monkeys came to the flowering trees that grow in the neighbourhood of Nandigrama and resemble those of Caitaratha, the gardens of the King of the Celestials. There he beheld people who, with their wives, sons and grandsons, well-attired were given up to enjoyment in those pleasant surroundings.", "Thereafter, at a distance of one league from Ayodhya, he observed Bharata, dad in a black antelope skin, sad, emaciated, wearing matted locks, his limbs besmeared with dust, dwelling in a hermitage, afflicted on account of his brother\u2019s misfortune. Living on fruit and roots, practising penance, self-controlled, his hair knotted, dressed in bark and a black antelope skin, disdplined, pure of soul, like unto a Brahmarishi in radiance, he, having placed Rama\u2019s sandals before him, ruled the earth by protecting the four castes from every peril with the aid of his ministers, and virtuous priests and senior officers wearing red robes surrounded him. And his subjects, faithful to their duty, had resolved not to neglect the welfare of their king, who resembling, righteousness itself, seemed to be the God of Dharma incarnate.", "Then Hanuman, paying obeisance with joined palms, said to that loyal prince:\u2014", "\u201cYour brother, Kakutstha, for whose exile to the Forest of Dandaka in robes of bark and matted locks, you grievest, enquires as to your welfare. I bring you good tidings, O Prince, abandon your despair; the moment has come when you will be re-united with your brother Rama. Having slain Ravana and recovered Maithili, Raghava is returning with his valiant friends, his purpose accomplished. The mighty Lakshmana too is coming and the illustrious Vaidehi, Rama\u2019s devoted companion, as Saci is to Mahendra.\u201d", "Hearing Hanuman\u2019s words, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi swooned with joy, felicity causing him to lose consciousness. In a moment, however, the descendant of Raghu, Bharata, rose up breathing with an effort and addressed Hanuman who had brought him those pleasant tidings. Deeply moved, the fortunate Bharata, embracing the monkey bedewed him with his tears that fell from him in great drops, inspired not by suffering but by joy, and said:\u2014", "\u201cWhether you be god or man who has come hither out of compassion for me, O My Friend, I wish to bestow a gift on you for the happy tidings you have brought me. I offer you a hundred thousand cows, as also a hundred prosperous villages and sixteen youthful women for your consorts, possessed of curls, with sweet expressions, golden skins, shapely noses, lovely ankles and gracious mien, resembling the moon, adorned with every kind of ornament, all of noble families.\u201d", "Hearing from that Prince of Monkeys of the miraculous return of Rama, Bharata, whose desire to behold his brother again threw him into a transport of delight, added joyfully:\u2014", "\u201cVerily it is with joy that I learn these tidings of my protector after the innumerable years that he has passed in the forest.

Answer my questions candidly!\u201d", "Thus interrogated by the prince, Hanuman, seating himself on a heap of Kusha Grass, began to describe Rama\u2019s life in the forest and said:\u2014", "\u201cO Lord, you knowest how he was exiled on account of the two boons bestowed on your mother; how the King Dasaratha died in consequence of his son\u2019s banishment; how the messengers, O Lord, brought you back from Rajagriha; how, returning to Ayodhya, you didst refuse the crown; how you didst go to Cittrakuta to appeal to your brother, the scourge of his foes, begging him to accept the throne, thus conforming to the way of virtuous men; how Rama renounced the kingdom and how, on returning, you didst bring back the sandals of that illustrious hero; all this, O Long-armed Warrior is well-known to you but what happened subsequent to your departure, now hear from me!", "\u201cAfter your return, distress seized the denizens of the forest, creating a great turmoil. Thereupon Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the huge, dreadful and lonely Dandaka Forest that was trodden down by elephants and formidable with its lions, tigers and deer. Having penetrated into its depths, the powerful Viradha appeared before them emitting fearful cries. Lifting him up, as he was roaring like a great elephant, those two warriors threw him headlong into a pit and having accomplished that difficult exploit, the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, at dusk reached the enchanting hermitage of Sharabhanga. That Sage having ascended to heaven, Rama, a true hero, paid obeisance to the ascetics and thereafter went to Janasthana.", "\u201cFourteen thousand titans, who dwelt in Janasthana, were slain during the time that the mighty Raghava resided there. For having fallen into the hands of the only Rama, during the fourth watch, those demons were wholly exterminated. Taking advantage of their great power, in order to harass the ascetics, those demons, inhabitants of the Dandaka Forest, were slain by Rama in combat. The demons slain and Khara also, Rama then despatched Dushana and subsequently Trishiras. Thereafter a female demon, named Shurpanakha, accosted him and, bang ordered to do so, Lakshmana, rising, took up his sword and instantly cut off her ears and nose. Thus mutilated, that titan woman took refuge with Ravana.", "\u201cThen a redoubtable titan in Ravana\u2019s service, named Marica, assuming the form of a jewelled deer, beguiled Vaidehi, who, on beholding it, said to Rama:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O My Beloved, capture it for me, it will enliven our solitude.\u2019", "\u201cRaghava, bow in hand, rushed out in pursuit of that deer and destroyed it with a single arrow, O My Friend.", "\u201cWhile Raghava, however, was thus engaged in the chase, Lakshmana too had left the hermitage, and Dashagriva, entering there, speedily took hold of Sita, as Graha seizes Rohini in the sky. Slaying the Vulture Jatayu, who sought to deliver her, the titan, taking hold of Sita, departed in all haste for his capital. Meanwhile some strange looking monkeys, as large as hills, standing on the summit of a mountain, astonished, observed Ravana, the King of the Titans proceeding with Sita in his arms; and, mounting into the sky with her in the Chariot Pushpaka, which was as swift as thought, the all-powerful Ravana returned to Lanka. There he entered bis vast palace decorated with pure gold and, with many words, sought to console Vaidehi but she, regarding his speech and his person with disdain and as less than a straw, was imprisoned in the Ashoka Grove.", "\u201cMeantime Rama returned, having slain the deer in the forest and, as he did so, he beheld the vulture so beloved of his sire, dead, at which he suffered extreme distress. Thereafter Raghava with Lakshmana set out in search of Vaidehi and they crossed the Godavari River with its flowering woodlands.", "\u201cIn the great forest, the two princes met a titan, named Kabandha, counselled by whom that true hero repaired to the Mountain Rishyamuka in order to confer with Sugriva and, even before they met, they were firm friends.", "\u201cSugriva had formerly been banished by his irascible brother Bali and, in consequence of this meeting, a sound alliance was formed between them.

How can I, who am but a young steer, bear the heavy load that one full grown is scarcely able to sustain?

Nor am I able to follow in your footsteps, O Hero, O Scourge of Your Foes! As a tree with a vast trunk and branches, planted in a courtyard, that has grown immense and difficult to climb, dries up when it has blossomed without yielding any fruit, so, O Long-armed Prince, if, being our master, you dost not uphold us all, we your servants, are in the same case!", "\u201cLet the universe to-day witness thine enthronement, O Raghava, you who art as radiant as the sun at noon in all its effulgence.

The hero, Bharata, attended on Rama\u2019s robing and Shatrughna, the upholder of the prosperity of the Ikshvakus, on Lakshmana\u2019s, and all the consorts of King Dasaratha attended on Sita.

In the midst of his counsellors, the brahmins and the people, Rama shone with splendour like unto the moon amidst the stars; and, as he advanced along the highway, preceded by the musicians and those who bore the Svastika on the palms of their hands, he was attended by a joyous crowd. Before Rama marched those who carried roasted grain and gold, and virgins and kine were there with the Twice-born and men with their hands full of Modaka (a kind of sweetmeat).", "Meantime Rama informed his ministers of his alliance with Sugriva and of the prowess of the son of Anila; and the monkeys and the inhabitants of Ayodhya were astounded by the narrative concerning the monkeys\u2019 exploits and the valour of the titans.

The mighty and valorous Sushena returned with his vessel, adorned with every variety of gem, bearing water from the eastern sea; Rishabha, without delay, brought water from the southern sea; Gavaya, with his urn powdered with red sandal and camphor, filled it at the vast ocean of the west, and Hanuman, the marvellous son of Anila, who was as swift as the wind, with his huge urn, encrusted with diamonds, drew water from the icy northern sea.", "Beholding the water brought by those foremost of monkeys for Rama\u2019s coronation, Shatrughna, attended by servants, imparted the tidings to the chief Priest Vasishtha, and his companions, and that venerable one hastened there with the brahmins, whereupon he caused Rama accompanied by Sita, to ascend a throne inlaid with precious gems.

Thereafter, on Vasava\u2019s command, Vayu bestowed on Raghava a brilliant golden garland embellished with a hundred lotuses, and a necklace of pearls enriched with every variety of gem was also conferred on that Lord of Men by Shakra.", "The Gods and Gandharvas sang and troops of Apsaras danced at the installation of the virtuous Rama, who was worthy of that honour. The earth too was covered with rich crops and the trees with their fruit and flowers gave forth their fragrance in honour of Raghava. Hundreds and thousands of horses, cows and heifers were distributed amongst the Twice-born by that prince, who had already bestowed hundreds of bulls on the brahmins; and Raghava gave them thirty crores of gold and rich attire and priceless ornaments.", "Then a golden crown encrusted with precious stones, glittering like the sun\u2019s rays, was offered to Sugriva by that valiant leader of men, who bestowed two bracelets set with emeralds, the lustre of which rivalled the moon\u2019s, on Angada, the son of Bali. And Rama gave unto Sita a necklace of pearls embellished with gems that was without peer and like unto moonbeams, and celestial and immaculate raiment richly embroidered with superb ornaments. Then Vaidehi, the delight of Janaka, prepared to bestow her own necklace on the son of the Wind as a token and, unclasping it from her neck, she looked on all the monkeys and on her lord again and again, whereupon Rama, understanding her gesture and approving it, said to the daughter of Janaka:\u2014", "\u201cGive the necklace to whom you pleases, O Lovely and Illustrious Lady!\u201d", "Thereupon the dark-eyed Sita gave the necklace to the son of Vayu, and Hanuman, in whom courage, strength, glory, skill, capability and reserve, prudence, audacity and prowess were ever to be found, that lion among monkeys, adorned with that necklace, looked as radiant as a mountain covered by a white cloud silvered by an aureole of moonbeams.", "Thereafter all the elder and leading monkeys received fitting gifts of jewels and raiment, whereupon Sugriva, Hanuman, Jambavan and all those monkeys having been overwhelmed with favours by Rama of imperishable exploits, and received precious gems in addition, according to their merits, with all that their hearts could desire, returned joyfully from whence they had come; and Rama, the scourge of his foes, lord of the earth, sought out Dvivida, Mainda and Nila and satisfied all their wishes.", "Thereupon the festival which they had attended being terminated, the foremost of the monkeys took leave of that lord of men and returned to Kishkindha. And Sugriva, the King of the Monkeys, having assisted at Rama\u2019s coronation and being overwhelmed with honours by him, went back to his capital.", "Thereafter, Bibishana, that virtuous monarch, having obtained the kingdom of bis forbears, returned to Lanka full of glory with the leading titans.", "The supremely illustrious and magnanimous Raghava, having slain his foes, ruled his empire in peace, enhancing the joy of his people.", "Devoted to virtue, Rama addressed Lakshmana who was fixed in his duty, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Faithful One, aid me in defending the land protected by the ancient kings with their armies.

Thereafter that prince performed the Paundarika, Ashvamedha, Vajimedha and other sacrifices of many kinds again and again. Reigning for ten thousand years, he offered up ten horse sacrifices, distributing immense wealth in charity, and Rama, whose arms reached to his knees, the powerful elder brother of Lakshmana, ruled the earth in glory and performed many sacrifices with his sons, brothers and kinsfolk. No widow was ever found in distress nor was there any danger from snakes or disease during his reign; there were no malefactors in his kingdom nor did any suffer harm; no aged person ever attended the funeral of a younger relative; happiness was universal; each attended to his duty and they had only to look on Rama to give up enmity. Men lived for a thousand years, each having a thousand sons who were free from infirmity and anxiety; trees bore fruit and flowers perpetually; Parjanya sent down rain when it was needed and Maruta blew auspiciously; all works undertaken bore happy results and all engaged in their respective duties and eschewed evil. All were endowed with good qualities; all were devoted to pious observances and Rama ruled over the kingdom for ten thousand years.", "This renowned and sacred epic, the foremost of all, granting long life and victory to kings, was composed by the Rishi Valmiki, and he who hears it constantly in this world is delivered from evil; if he desires sons he obtains them, if wealth he acquires it.", "He who, in this world, listens to the story of Rama\u2019s enthronement, if he be a king, will conquer the earth and overcome his enemies.

Furnished with your bow, you canst undoubtedly destroy the Three Worlds! By heaven\u2019s favour, we behold you with Sita victorious to-day. We see you with your brother Lakshmana, who is devoted to thine interests, in the midst of your mothers and other brothers, O Virtuous Prince. By the grace of heaven, the Rangers of the Night, Prahasta, Vikata, Virupaksha, Mahodara, Akampana and Durdharsha have perished. By divine grace, O Rama, Kumbhakarna, he, whose monstrous form had no equal in the world, was overthrown by you in combat. Trishiras, Atikaya, Devantaka and Narantaka, those mighty night rangers, were struck down by you, O Rama. By the grace of heaven, you didst measure your strength against that Indra of Titans whom the Gods themselves were unable to destroy and didst vanquish him in single combat. Assuredly it was no small matter for you to overcome Ravana in fight but, by divine grace, you wast able to join issue with Ravani and, in combat, slay him also.", "\u201cOnce you wast delivered from his magic bonds, O Long-armed Hero, by heaven\u2019s favour, you didst triumph over that enemy of the Gods who bore down on you like Time itself!

Did I not overcome those Rangers of the Night, Atikaya, Trishiras and Dhumraksha who were full of courage? Why, therefore, do you extol me because of Ravani? In what lay his special power, strength and prowess? How was he superior to Ravana? If I may learn it, for this is no command I lay upon you, if it be no secret that you may not reveal, I desire to know it, therefore speak! Shakra himself was vanquished by him; in virtue of what boon and from what source did the son derive those powers that his sire Ravana, did not possess? From whence did this titan gain pre-eminence over his father in combat? How was he able to triumph over Indra?

One is unable to enumerate all the virtues he owed to his excellent character and it is sufficient to say that he was the son of Prajapati and, as such, was the favourite of the Gods. He was beloved of the entire world on account of his charming qualities and great wisdom. In order to pursue his ascetic practices, that foremost of Munis repaired to the hermitage of Trinabindu and took up his abode on the slopes of the great Mountain Meru. There, that virtuous soul, his senses fully controlled, gave himself up to the practice of austerity, but some youthful maidens, whose fathers were Rishis, Pannagas and Rajarishis, wandering in those solitudes, disturbed him. Accompanied by Apsaras, they came to divert themselves in that place and, as it was possible to find fruits in every season and disport oneself in those woods, the young girls constantly went there to play. Attracted by the charms of Paulastya\u2019s retreat, they sang, played their instruments and danced, thus in full innocence, distracting the hermit from the exercise of his penances.", "\u201cOn this, that mighty and exalted Sage cried out in indignation:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018She who falls under my gaze, will instantly conceive!\u2019", "\u201cThereupon all those maidens, who heard the magnanimous Sage, terrified of the brahmin\u2019s curse, left that place; but the daughter of the Sage Trinabindu had not heard it.

Thereupon, discovering her condition, she became extremely bewildered and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018What has happened to me?\u2019 Thereafter, realising the truth, she returned to her father\u2019s hermitage.", "\u201cOn seeing her in that state, Trinabindu said:\u2014", "\u2018What means this strange condition in which you dost find thyself?\u2019", "\u201cThereat, with joined palms, the unfortunate girl answered that treasury of asceticism, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I do not know, Dear Father, what has brought me to this pass.

Do you dwell in Lanka and be happy! Do not hesitate! With its moats, golden walls, engines of war and the weapons with which it is filled, with its gold and emerald archways, that city is a marvel 1 The Rakshasas left it formerly in fear of Vishnu and it is deserted, all the demons having gone to the nethermost region. Now Lanka is empty and has no protector. Go and inhabit it, My Son, and be happy! No harm will visit you there.\u2019", "\u201cHearing the words of his sire, the virtuous Vaishravana went to dwell in Lanka on the summit of the mountain, and soon, under his rule, it was filled with thousands of delighted Nairritas disporting themselves.", "\u201cThat righteous King of the Nairritas, the blessed Sage Vaishravana, dwelt in Lanka, that city surrounded by the sea and, from time to time, the saintly Lord of Wealth, in the Pushpaka Chariot, went to visit his father and mother. Hymned by the Hosts of the Gods and Gandharvas and entertained by the dances of the Apsaras, that Guardian of Wealth, radiating glory like unto the sun, went to visit his sire.\u201d", "This discourse of Agastya filled Rama with astonishment. \u201cHow was it that the Rakshasas formerly dwelt in Lanka?\u201d, such was the question that Rama put to the ascetic, shaking his head and casting wondering glances upon him from time to time.", "He said:\u2014\u201cO Blessed One, the words \u2018Formerly Lanka belonged to the Eaters of Flesh\u2019 from your lips causes me extreme surprise. We have been told that the Rakshasas were the offspring of Paulastya and now, you affirmest that they owe their origin to a different source. Were Ravana, Kumbhakarna, Prahasta, Vikata and Ravani stronger than they? Who, O Brahmin, was their first king? What was the name of that one of terrific strength? For what fault were they driven out by Vishnu? Tell me all in detail, O Irreproachable Sage and, as the sun chases away the shade, so dispel my curiosity!\u201d", "Hearing Raghava\u2019s fair and eloquent words, Agastya, amazed, answered:\u2014", "\u201cFormerly Prajapati created the waters, choosing that element as his source and, thereafter, in order to protect it, that lotus-born One generated all creatures.", "Then those beings, tormented by hunger and thirst, humbly presented themselves before their author and enquired saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018What shall we do?\u2019", "\u201cWhereupon Prajapati, smiling, gave this answer to them all:\u2014", "\u2018Protect the waters carefully, O Sons of Manu!\u2019", "Then some said:\u2014\u2018Rakshami\u2019 (we will protect) and others \u2018Yakshami\u2019 (we will sacrifice).

Then the infant who had just been born and was as radiant as the autumnal sun, whose voice resembled the rumbling of a cloud, placing his fist in his mouth cried for a long time, and Shiva, who was following the Path of the Wind, mounted on his bull and accompanied by Parvati, heard the sound of weeping and with Uma beheld the son of the Rakshasi who was crying. Allowing himself to be moved by compassion by his consort, Bhava, the Destroyer of Tripura, made him equal to his mother in age and bestowed immortality upon him.", "Thereafter the unchanging and imperishable Mahadeva bestowed an aerial car upon him that traversed space, in order to gratify Parvati, and she, on her side, also conferred a boon on him, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018The Rakshasas shall conceive instantly and give birth as they conceive; their children shall at once attain the age of their mothers.\u2019", "\u201cThereafter the highly intelligent Sukesha, proud of the favours he had received, having obtained this great fortune from the Lord Hara, began to range everywhere, displaying himself in his aerial car and resembling Purandara when he obtained heaven.", "\u201cA gandharva named Gramani, who was as effulgent as fire, had a daughter named Devavati in all the beauty of her youth, famed in the Three Worlds, equal to a second Shri, and that virtuous Gandharva, beholding Sukesha to be thus endowed, gave her to him as a second Shri of whom he was the guardian.", "\u201cApproaching her beloved consort, who had attained a sovereign state by virtue of the boons he had received, as a mendicant on whom wealth has been conferred, Devavati was highly delighted. United to that woman, the ranger of the night appeared as majestic as a great elephant, the offspring of Aryama. In time Sukesha became a father, O Raghava, and begot three sons, the equals of the Three Sacrificial Fires, Malyavan, Sumali and Mali, the foremost of heroes, rivals of the Three-eyed God; such were the sons of the Sovereign of the Rakshasas. In repose, they resembled the Three worlds, in action, they were like unto the three Sacrificial Fires, as powerful as the Three Vedas and as formidable as the three humours of the body. \u201cThese three sons of Sukesha, shining like three fires, throve like diseases that have been neglected and, learning of the boons their sire had received, which had led him to increased sovereignty and which he owed to his asceticism, the three brothers repaired to Mount Meru in order to practice penance.", "\u201cAdopting a rigid and formidable course of austerity, O Foremost of Monarchs, those Rakshasas gave themselves up to fearful mortifications, sowing terror among all beings.

Thereupon those rangers of the night, O Rama, who had become supremely arrogant on account of the boons they had received, began to harass the Gods and Asuras, and the Celestials with the companies of Rishis and Caranas, being thus persecuted and having no protector with whom they could take refuge, resembled beings in hell.", "\u201cMeantime, O Prince of Raghu, the three Rakshasas sought out the immortal Vishvakarma, the foremost of architects and joyously said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O You, who from thine own resources, created the palaces of the great Gods, strong, dazzling and impregnable, do you in your transcendent intelligence construct a dwelling for us of our own choosing on the Himavat, Meru or Mandara Mountains. Build us a vast abode equal to that belonging to Maheshvara.\u2019", "\u201cThen the mighty-armed Vishvakarma spoke to the Rakshasas concerning a residence equal to Indra\u2019s Amaravati and said", "\u201c\u2018On the shores of the southern sea there is a mountain named Trikuta and there is also another named Suvela, O Princes of the Rakshasas. On the central peak resembling a cloud, inaccessible even to birds and which is hewn on four sides, is a city of thirty leagues in extent, covering a space of a hundred leagues in length. Surrounded by golden walls, pierced by gateways and furnished with terraces of gold, it is called Lanka, and was constructed by me at Shakra\u2019s command. Go and establish yourselves in that city, O Invincible Rakshasas, as the inhabitants of heaven dwell in Amaravati. When you occupy that Citadel of Lanka with the innumerable Rakshasas who surround you, none will be able to expel you and you will overcome your foes.\u2019", "\u201cThus counselled by Vishvakarma, the foremost of the Rakshasas followed by thousands of their companions went to inhabit the City of Lanka. Surrounded by strong walls and deep moats, it was filled with hundreds of golden palaces and there the rangers of the night began to dwell in great felicity.", "\u201cAt that time, there lived a Gandharvi named Narmada, O Descendant of Raghu, and she had three daughters born of her own will, who were as lovely as Shri or Kirti.

Sundari had a daughter also, O Rama, the lovely Anala.", "\u201cOn her side, the consort of Sumali, whose complexion resembled the full moon, was called Katumati and she was dearer to him than his own life.

Thereafter, He Who is dear to the God Who bears the Spear [i.e., Karttikeya, also called Skanda] drawing out that lance, hurled it at Malyavan and, as formerly Skanda loosed it, that weapon, flying from the hand of Govinda, rushed on the Rakshasa like unto a great meteor striking the Anjana Mountain, and it fell on his mighty chest, that was adorned with innumerable diamonds, as lightning strikes a rocky summit. That blow cut his mail asunder and his eyes were veiled but, recovering consciousness, he stood erect once more, like unto an immoveable rock. Armed with an iron club with innumerable spikes, he struck the God violently in the centre of the breast and, in his martial ardour, having wounded the younger brother of Vasava with his fist, that ranger of the night retreated a bow\u2019s length. At that moment, the cry \u2018Excellent, Excellent\u2019 arose in the sky.", "\u201cThereafter the Rakshasa attacked Garuda, and Vainateya incensed, drove him off with the blast of his wings as a violent tempest disperses a heap of withered leaves.", "\u201cSeeing his elder brother driven back by the blast of Garuda\u2019s wings, Sumali, overcome with confusion, with his troops fled in the direction of Lanka.

It was You Who didst destroy those warriors of the family of Paulastya named Sumali, Malyavan, Mali and their companions, who were all exceedingly resourceful and more powerful than Ravana. None other could have subdued the enemies of the Gods or have weeded out those thorns in the side of the Celestials, save Narayana, the God Who bears the conch, discus and mace.

Beholding that son of Paulastya, that lord who was as radiant as a God, advancing towards him like unto fire, he, amazed, returned to Rasatala from the world of men.", "\u201cThereafter that exceedingly intelligent Rakshasa reflected \u2018Which is the best way of increasing our power?\u2019", "Thus did the foremost of the Rakshasas, who was like unto a dark cloud and was wearing golden earrings, reflect within himself and, having considered awhile, that extremely sagacious Rakshasa said to his daughter Kaikasi, for such was her name:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018My Daughter, it is time for you to wed; your youth is slipping away and, afraid of being refused, those who are in love with you do not pay their suit. Striving to fulfil our duty, we seek only thine advantage. Assuredly, you are endowed with every good attribute and resemblest Shri in person, O Dear Child! A young daughter is a source of anxiety to her father who is concerned for her honour, nor does he know whom she will wed. O Beloved Child, the mother\u2019s family, the father\u2019s family and the one into which she is received are all three involved in this anxiety. Do you therefore seek out that blessed ascetic, the foremost of Paulastya\u2019s offspring and choose Vishravas, the descendant of Paulastya, O My Daughter. Assuredly you will beget sons equal to that Lord of Wealth, who, in his splendour, rivals the sun.\u2019", "\u201cAt these words, in filial obedience, that young girl went to seek out Vishravas where he was undergoing penance.

The rest must be known to you.\u2019", "Thereafter the Muni, reflecting awhile, uttered these words:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I know well, O Fortunate One, what brings you here, you are desirous of having sons by me, you whose gait is like unto an intoxicated elephant! But, having presented thyself at this hour[1], hear me, O Fortunate One, you shalt bring forth offspring of a dark aspect delighting in the companionship of doers of evil deeds.

You who art of immeasurable might, strive to be like Vaishravana himself.\u2019", "\u201cHearing his mother\u2019s words, the arrogant Dashagriva experienced a wave of overpowering bitterness, whereupon he formulated this vow.", "\u201c\u2018I swear to you in truth that I shall become my brother\u2019s equal if not his superior in power; banish any fears that may have entered thine heart!\u2019", "\u201cThereafter, in his spleen, Dashagriva, accompanied by his younger brother, began to undertake an exceedingly difficult task, undergoing a rigid penance.", "(He thought) \u2018I shall accomplish mine end by asceticism\u2019 and having thus resolved, he went to the lovely hermitage of Gokarna in order to purify his soul.

In this wise, Bibishana, like an inhabitant of heaven in the Nandana Gardens, dwelt for ten thousand years. And Dashagriva deprived himself of nourishment for the same period and every thousand years sacrificed one of his heads to the God of Fire. Thus nine thousand years passed and nine of his heads had been sacrificed to Fire; when ten thousand years had gone by, Dashagriva prepared to sever his tenth head when the Grandsire of the World appeared, and He, with the Gods, highly gratified, presented Himself before Ravana and said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I am pleased with you, what boon shall I confer on you this day?

Without being instructed, may I be able to use the Brahma Weapon. May whatever thoughts come to me, wherever or in whatever state I find myself, always conform to virtue and may I fulfil my duty! O Most Exalted of Beings, these are the boons I consider to be the most precious; for those who follow dharma nothing is impossible!\u2019", "\u201cThen Prajapati, full of joy, again addressed Bibishana saying", "\u201c\u2018O Most Virtuous and Dear Child, let it be as you sayest, though you wast born in the Rakshasa Race, O Slayer of Your Foes, no evil ever enters your heart!

Many and many a time, under the threat of that terror, we abandoned our retreat but, being pursued, together we plunged into hell. Your brother, that crafty Lord of Wealth, took possession of the City of Lanka, the abode of the Rakshasas. If it be possible by conciliation, gifts or force, to regain the possession of it, then do so, 0 Irreproachable Hero! You wflt then become the sovereign of Lanka and, by your grace, the Rakshasa Race, that has been disestablished, will be reinstated; thereafter you will reign over us all, O Lord.\u2019", "\u201cThen Dashagriva answered his maternal grandfather who stood near and said", "\u201c\u2018The Lord of Wealth is mine elder brother; it is not fitting that you should speak thus.\u2019", "\u201cQuietly rebuked in this wise by that Indra of the Rakshasas, the most powerful of them all, Sumali, being aware of his intentions, did not insist further.", "\u201cSome time later, as Ravana continued to reside in that place, Prahasta addressed these significant words to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Valiant Dashagriva, such a speech is not worthy of you; brotherly love is not the concern of heroes! Hear me 1 There were two sisters who loved each other and who were supremely fair; they were wedded to that Lord of Creatures, the Prajapati Kashyapa, and with him Aditi begot the Gods, those Lords of the Three Worlds, whilst Diti begot the Daityas. To the Daityas, those virtuous heroes, the earth, with its mountains, surrounded by the ocean, formerly belonged. They waxed exceedingly strong, nevertheless they were slain in war by the mighty Vishnu, who gave over the imperishable Triple World to the Gods. You are therefore not the only one to act in opposition to a brother, which was done by the Gods and Asuras. Follow my counsel therefore!\u2019", "\u201cDashagriva, hearing these words was filled with joy and, having reflected a moment, he said, \u2018It is well!\u2019 and, in his delight, that same day the valiant Dashagriva with his rangers of the night repaired to the wood bordering on Lanka. Stationed on the Trikuta Mountain, that ranger of the night sent out Prahasta, who was skilled in speech, as his ambassador, and said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Go speedily, O Prahasta, and speak to the foremost of the Nairritas, addressing him in conciliatory words, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018This City of Lanka, O King, belongs to the magnanimous Rakshasas! O My Friend, you didst take possession of it; it is not just, O You who art beyond reproach! If you dost restore it to us now, O Hero of unrivalled exploits, I shall be gratified and justice will have been maintained.\u2019", "\u201cThen Prahasta repaired to the City of Lanka, whose strong support was Dhanada, and addressed that Lord of Wealth of illustrious lineage in the following words:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I have been deputed by your brother Dashagriva, who is near at hand, that long-armed hero who is pious and the foremost of", "warriors, to come hither and my words are those of Dashanana, O Lord of Wealth 1", "\u201c\u2018This ravishing city, O Large-eyed Hero, was formerly held by the Rakshasas of terrible exploits, whose chief was Sumali. It is on this account, dear son of Vishravas, that Dashagriva asks you to restore it to them; this request is made in all friendliness.\u2019", "\u201cHaving heard Prahasta, Vaishravana replied in words worthy of one who is skilled in speech and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Lanka was bestowed on me by my sire when it had been abandoned by the rangers of the night; I have peopled it by inducements of gifts, honours and every kind of privilege. Now go and bring this answer to Dashagriva\u2014\u201cThe city and the kingdom under my dominion are thine also, O Long-armed Hero, enjoy this realm without restriction; share this dominion and its riches with me without division.\u201d\u2019", "\u201cHaving spoken thus, that Lord of Wealth went to visit his sire and paying obeisance to him related the nature of Ravana\u2019s request, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O My Father, Dashagriva has sent a messenger to me, saying, \u201cGive up the City of Lanka that was formerly occupied by the Rakshasa Race.\u201d What shall I do now, O Blessed One, tell me?\u2019", "\u201cOn this enquiry, the Brahmarishi Vishravas, foremost of the ascetics, said to Dhanada who stood before him with joined palms:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Hear me, O My Son, the long-armed Dashagriva has spoken of this matter in my presence and I have often rebuked him; he is exceedingly wicked and, in my wrath, I said to him \u201cYou will be destroyed; it were better for you to listen to my words which are fraught with reason and integrity\u201d. He is perverse however, and the boons he has received have so intoxicated him that he can no longer discriminate between what is just and unjust. It is on account of my curse that he has fallen into this lamentable condition. Do you therefore retire to Mount Kailasha, that support of the earth, O Long-armed Hero, and leave Lanka with your followers at once. In that place the enchanting Mandakini, the most excellent of rivers flows, whose waters are covered with golden lotuses radiant as the sun, and Kumuda, Utpala and other varieties of water-lilies of sweet fragrance. Devas, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Uragas and Kinneras sojourn there, constantly disporting themselves. It is not fitting, O Dhanada, that you should enter into combat with that Rakshasa, for you are conversant with the special boons he has received.\u2019", "\u201cHearing this reply and obedient to the counsel of his venerable sire, Dhanada left Lanka with his consort, his sons, his ministers, his vehicles and his wealth.", "\u201cMeantime Prahasta had sought out the mighty Dashagriva and, with a joyous heart, said to him in the midst of his counsellors:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018The City of Lanka is now free, Dhanada has abandoned it and has departed. Do you establish thyself therein so that, with us, you canst fulfil your duty.\u2019", "\u201cThus did Prahasta speak, and the all-powerful Dashagriva invaded Lanka with his brothers, his army and his court. As the Gods enter heaven, so did that enemy of the Celestials enter that city that Dhanada had just deserted and which was divided by well-planned highways. Enthroned by the rangers of the night, Dashanana installed himself in that city, which was filled with Rakshasas resembling dark clouds.", "\u201cThe Lord of Wealth, however, in reverence for his father\u2019s words, built a city on Mount Kailasha which was immaculate as the moon, adorned with splendid palaces sumptuously decorated, as Purandara constructed Amaravati.", "\u201cThe foremost of the Rakshasas, having been anointed king, with his brother began to consider giving his sister in marriage.

There was a nymph named Hema of whom you have already heard. The Gods bestowed her on me, as Pauloma was given to Shatakratu. Full of love for her, I passed centuries at her side when she was taken from me by the Gods. Thirteen years passed and in the fourteenth, I built a golden city which I decorated with diamonds and emeralds by the aid of my magic powers. There I dwelt, deprived of Hema, sad, dejected and extremely wretched. Thereafter, taking my daughter with me, I left that city in order to retire to the forest. This is my child, O King, who was brought up in Hema\u2019s lap and here I am seeking a husband for her. A daughter is a great calamity, at least for all those who have regard to her honour. In truth, she is a source of anxiety to the family of her father and that of her mother.", "\u201c\u2018Two sons were also born to me by my wife; the first was Mayavi, O Dear Friend, and Dundubhi followed immediately. I have told you the whole truth in accordance with your wish 1 And now, My Dear Son, I would know something of you, who art you?\u2019", "\u201cAt these words the Rakshasa answered respectfully:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I am of Paulastya\u2019s race and my name is Dashagriva, my father was the Sage Vishravas, who was the third son of Brahma.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cOn hearing these words of that Indra among the Rakshasas, O Rama, indicating that he was the son of a great Sage, Maya, the foremost of the Danavas wished to give his daughter to him.

Maya was conversant with the curse that Dashagriva\u2019s sire, that treasury of asceticism had pronounced, nevertheless he bestowed his daughter in marriage on him, knowing him to be the offspring of the Grandsire of the World. At the same time, he gave him a marvellous spear which he had obtained through his supreme penances. It was with this weapon that Ravana wounded Lakshmana. Then, having brought about this marriage, the Lord of Lanka returned to that city.", "\u201cThere, with their consent, he chose two wives for his two brothers; the daughter of Virocana, named Vajravala, was given by him to Kumbhakama, and Bibishana received as wife the virtuous Sarama, the daughter of the King of the Gandharvas, the magnanimous Shailusha, and she had been born on the shores of the Lake Manasa.", "\u201cAt that time in the rainy season, the waters of the Manasa Lake were swollen and the mother of the girl cried out affectionately, \u2018Do not overflow, O Lake!\u2019 Thereafter the girl was called Sarama.", "\u201cThese alliances having been concluded, the Rakshasas gave themselves up to pleasure, each with his own coflsort, as the Gandharvas in the Nandana Gardens.", "\u201cAnd Mandodari gave birth to a child with the voice of a thunder-doud, he who is known to you as Indrajita. Scarcely had he been born than that son of Ravana began to roar with a terrible voice, like unto thunder, and the city was deafened, O Raghava. His father therefore called him Meghanada; and he grew up in the magnificent private apartments, hidden in the lap of the foremost of women, as a fire is concealed under shavings; and that son of Ravana filled his mother and father with joy.", "\u201cSome time later, the Lord of the Worlds sent Nidra [i.e., The Personification of Sleep] to Kumbhakarna in the form of overpowering sleep and Kumbhakarna said to his brother, who was present:\u2014", "\u2018\u201cO King, sleep holds me in thrall, prepare a refuge for me.\u2019", "\u201cTherefore the king selected some artisans, like unto Vish-vakarma, who constructed a splendid dwelling for Kumbhakarna, a league in expanse and two in length which was exceedingly sumptuous and secluded. On every side, it was decorated with columns of crystal encrusted with gold; the stairways were made of emerald with rows of small bells hanging from the carved ivory galleries, the floors being of diamond and crystal.", "\u201cAll should have been constantly and wholly happy in that place, which was enchanting and luxurious in every way, and which was built by the Rakshasas and resembled a sacred cave in the Meru Mountain. It was there, overcome by slumber, that the mighty Kumbhakarna rested innumerable years without waking.", "\u201cWhilst his brother, the mighty Kumbhakarna, overcome by Nidra, slept for thousands of years without waking, Dashanana, of unbridled passions, harassed the Devas, Rishis, Yakshas and Gandharvas and overran their beautiful parks and groves like a madman, laying them waste; and that Rakshasa churned up the rivers, like an elephant disporting itself, agitating the trees like a violent tempest and striking the hills as if by lightning.", "\u201cHearing of Dashagriva\u2019s exploits, the virtuous Lord of Wealth, reflecting that he was his own brother, for the honour of his race and desirous of manifesting fraternal affection, sent a messenger to Lanka in Dashagriva\u2019s interests.", "\u201cThen the messenger, entering the city, approached Bibishana who received him with honour and enquired concerning his visit. After asking about the welfare of Dhanadaand his kinsfolk, Bibishana brought him to Dashanana in the assembly hall where he was resting.", "\u201cBeholding the king blazing in his own effulgence, the messenger said:\u2014\u2018Hail to you, O King\u2019 and having paid obeisance with these words, stood silent awhile. At that time Dashagriva was reclining on a sumptuous couch adorned with rich coverings whereupon the messenger addressed him saying:\u2014", "\u2018\u201cO King, I bring you the words uttered by your brother in their entirety\u2014\u2018Between us two, equality of conduct should exist as among others of our race. A truce to these evil deeds! From now on comport thyself in a seemly manner and, if possible, take righteousness as your guide! I have seen the Nandana Gardens laid waste and, it is said, that the Rishis have been persecuted; the measures that the Gods are taking against you are known to me. I have been disregarded by you on countless occasions, but even if a youthful person err, he should be protected by his relatives.", "\u201c\u2018Having repaired to the Himavat Plateau to practice dharma and subjugate my senses, I forced myself to undergo penance in order to gratify the Lord Mahadeva; there I beheld that divine God accompanied by Uma and a glance from my left eye fell on the Goddess 1 \u201cWho is this woman?\u201d I asked myself, desiring this knowledge and for no other reason, for Rudrani had assumed an unparalleled form. Then the Goddess, by her celestial power, consumed my left eye, which grew yellow and the light became obscured as if by dust.", "\u201c\u2018Thereupon I repaired to another vast mountain plateau and remained there eight hundred years observing silence.", "Having completed that penance, the God Maheshwara came to me and, highly gratified, said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018\u201cI am satisfied with thine austerities O Virtuous and Saintly Ascetic. This vow has been fulfilled by me and by you, O Lord of Rishis; noneother could have observed a similar mortification. These practices are extremely rigid and I myself formerly followed them also. Grant me your friendship therefore, O Sinless One, you have conquered me and your penance has been fruitful. As the Goddess, whose form you didst look upon, burnt up your left eye, turning it yellow, you shaft be named Ekakshipingali [i.e., yellow-eyed].\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Having thus contracted a friendship with Shankara, I took leave of him and, on my return, learnt of thine evil conduct. Abandon this impious course that will bring dishonour on our race. The Gods with the hosts of Rishis are considering how they may destroy you.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words, Dashagriva, his eyes red with anger, clenching his fists and teeth, answered him thus:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Messenger, I knew what you wast about to utter! Neither art you my brother nor is he who sent you; for the Lord of Wealth is not speaking in mine interests! That fool forces me to hear of his friendship with Maheshwara 1 This speech of thine is intolerable. I have borne it till now, for he is mine elder brother and, as such, it is not fitting that I should slay him. Now, hearing thine address, this is my resolve\u2014\u2018By the strength of mine arms, I shall conquer the Three Worlds. Solely on his account, I shall dispatch the Four Guardians of the World to the region of Yama!\u2019", "\u201cHaving spoken thus, the Lord of Lanka, Ravana, slew the messenger with a single stroke of his sword and gave him to the wicked Rakshasas to devour.

Hearing that the Lord of the Rakshasas, eager to fight, full of insolence and wickedness accompanied by his counsellors, had established himself on the mountain, the Yakshas dared not remain there for fear of him. Then they said to each other, \u2018This is the brother of our King\u2019 and, knowing this, they approached Dhaneshwara and, coming into his presence, they imparted his brother\u2019s intentions to him. Thereupon, with Dhanada\u2019s permission, they set out joyfully in order to give battle.", "\u201cThe impact of those valiant troops of the King of the Nairritas was as violent as the sea; and the mountains seemed to be riven asunder, whilst a furious struggle ensued amongst the followers of the Rakshasas and, seeing his army thrown into disorder, Dashagriva, the ranger of the night, after many encouraging shouts, flew into a rage. Then the companions of the King of the Rakshasas of redoubtable valour, each took on a thousand Yakshas. Smitten with blows from maces, iron bars, swords, picks and darts, Dushana, scarcely able to breathe, was overwhelmed by a rain of weapons which fell thick and fast like hail from the clouds. Nevertheless he remained unmoved under the shafts of the Yakshas, as a mountain that the clouds flood with innumerable showers.", "\u201cThereafter, that hero, brandishing his mace like unto Kala\u2019s sceptre, flung himself on the Yakshas whom he hurled into Yama\u2019s abode. Like unto fire, flaming up on account of the wind, consuming a heap of grass or dried faggots which are scattered about, so did he destroy the army of the Yakshas.", "\u201cAnd his ministers, Mahodara, Shuka and the others, only suffered a few of the Yakshas to escape, who resembled clouds dispersed by the wind. Overwhelmed with blows and broken, they fell in the fight, filled with fury, biting their lips with their sharp teeth. And some of the Yakshas, exhausted, clung to each other, their weapons broken, and sank down on the battlefield as dykes give way before a surge of waters. With those who were slain ascending to heaven, those who fought rushing hither and thither and the companies of Rishis witnessing the scene, there was not a single space left anywhere.", "\u201cBeholding the foremost of the Yakshas scattered despite their valour, the mighty Lord of Wealth despatched other Yakshas and, at his call, O Rama, a Yaksha named Samyodhakantaka instantly rushed out at the head of a large force. Struck by him in the fight, as by a second Vishnu with his discus, Marica fell to the earth like a star falling from the heights of Mount Kailasha, ts merits exhausted.", "\u201cThereafter, that Ranger of the Night, regaining consciousness, gathered up his strength in a moment and entered into combat with the Yaksha, who having been defeated, fled. Meantime Dashagriva, his limbs loaded with ornaments of gold, silver and emerald, advanced to the very portals of the outer defences and, seeing that Ranger of the Night enter, the doorkeeper sought to prevent him; but the Rakshasa forced his way in, whereupon the Yaksha seized hold of him. Seeing himself checked, O Rama, he was not discouraged and began to break down the door, whilst the Yaksha, overwhelmed by his blows, streaming with blood, looked like a mountain from which minerals are pouring.", "\u201cThough struck by the Yaksha with the door-post, that hero was not slain on account of the rare gifts received from Svyam-bhu, and in his turn, arming himself with the same post, he struck the Yaksha who, his body reduced to dust, disappeared, leaving no trace.", "\u201cThereupon, witnessing the strength of the Rakshasas, a general stampede took place among the Yakshas, who, mad with terror, sought refuge in the rivers and the caves, throwing away their arms, exhausted, their features distorted.", "[Full title: The Combat between Ravana and Dhanada. Ravana seizes Pushpaka].", "\u201cSeeing the foremost of the Yakshas fleeing in their thousands, the Lord of Wealth said to the powerful Manibhadra:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Prince of the Yakshas, slay that wicked Ravana of evil ways and deliver the valiant and heroic Yakshas!\u2019", "\u201cAt this command, the long-armed and invincible Manibhadra set out to fight surrounded by four thousand Yakshas and they hurled themselves on the Rakshasas, whom they struck with blows from maces, bars, javelins, lances, swords and clubs.

Advance!\u2019 \u2018Yield!\u2019 \u2018Never!\u2019 \u2018Fight!\u2019", "\u201cBeholding that formidable combat, the Devas, Gandharvas, Rishis and Chanters of the Veda were extremely astonished.

While wrestling with Dhumraksha in the great struggle, Manibhadra received a violent blow in the chest from a pike but remained unmoved, and he, in his turn, struck the Titan Dhumraksha on the head whereupon he fell senseless.", "\u201cSeeing Dhumraksha wounded and covered with blood, Dashanana hurled himself on Manibhadra in the thick of the fray and, while he was rushing on him in fury, the foremost of theYakshas,Manibhadra,piercedhimwiththreedarts. Wounded, Dashagriva struck a blow at Manibhadra\u2019s diadem which fell to one side and, from that day, he was known as \u2018Parsh-vamauli\u2019 [i.e., One whose diadem is awry].", "\u201cManibhadra, having been put to flight despite his valour, a great clamour arose on the mountain, O King. From afar, the Lord of Wealth, who was armed with a mace and surrounded by Shukra, Prausthapada, Padma and Shakha, beheld Ravana, and, seeing his brother in the field, having lost all dignity, deprived of his glory on account of the curse, the sagacious Kuvera addressed him in words worthy of the House of his Grandsire, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018As despite my warning, you dost not desist, O Perverse Wretch, you shalt recognize the consequences in the future, when you have fallen into hell. He who through heedlessness drinks poison and when he realises it, in his delusion, does not refrain, will know the results of his act in its effects. The Gods do not necessarily approve even dharmic actions, how much less those that bring about such a condition as thine; it is because of this that you are reduced to this state and you dost not appear to be aware of it. He who does not honour his mother, father, a brahmin or a preceptor, will reap the fruit of his fault when he falls under the sway of the Lord of Death. That fool who does not mortify his body will suffer hereafter, when after death he enters the region that his deeds have merited. No wicked man sees his designs fulfilled as he would have wished; as he sows so shall he reap. In this world, prosperity, beauty, power, sons, wealth and prowess are all attained by pious acts. Given over to such iniquitous deeds, you will go to hell. I will not parley with you further; thus should one act in respect of evil-doers!\u2019", "\u201cAt these words of Dhanada, which were addressed to Ravana\u2019s counsellors led by Marica, they being struck, turned and fled. Dashagriva, however, who had received a blow on the head from the mace of that powerful Lord of the Yakshas, did not move. Thereafter Yaksha and Rakshasa entered into a fierce and prolonged duel, experiencing no fatigue, and Dhanada loosed the Fire-weapon on the Lord of the Titans, who parried it with the Varuna weapon. Then Ravana, having recourse to magic, natural to a Rakshasa, transformed himself in a thousand ways in order to slay his adversary, and that Ten-necked One assumed the form of a tiger, a boar, a cloud, a mountain, an ocean, a tree, a Yaksha and a Daitya. Thus, though wearing many forms, his own remained hidden. Thereafter seizing hold of a mighty weapon, Dashagriva, whirling it round, brought that enormous mace down on the head of Dhanada and the blow knocked the Lord of Wealth senseless, who fell covered with blood, like unto an Ashoka Tree whose roots have been severed.", "\u201cThen Padma and other Rishis surrounded Dhanada and bore him through the sky to the Nandana Wood.", "\u201cHaving vanquished Dhanada, the foremost of the Rakshasas, with a joyful heart, as a sign of victory, seized the Chariot Pushpaka, that was furnished with golden pillars and doors of emerald, hung with strings of pearls and planted with trees bearing fruit in all seasons; swift as thought, it ranged everywhere at will in its aerial flight. Possessed of golden stairways, encrusted with gems and with floors of refined gold, that indestructible vehicle of the Gods, a perpetual joy to the eyes and heart, that masterpiece created by Vishvakarma at Brahma\u2019s command, with its countless ornaments, was indeed a marvel. All that could be desired was to be found therein and it was of a magnificence nothing could surpass; neither too hot nor too cold, it was pleasantly temperate at all seasons.", "\u201cAscending that chariot, which he had acquired by his prowess, coursing wheresoever he would, the King Ravana, in his pride and wickedness, deemed himself to have overcome the Three Worlds. Having conquered Vaishravana, he descended from Mount Kailasha and, having by his prowess obtained this great victory, that Ranger of the Night, dazzling in his diadem and necklace of flawless pearls, in his marvellous chariot, blazed like fire.", "\u201cO rama, having vanquished his brother, the supreme Lord of the Rakshasas went to the great fen where Mahasena was bom; and Dashagriva beheld that vast and golden expanse of reeds sending forth shafts of light like unto a second sun. Ascending the mountain which rose in the centre of that fen, O Rama, he observed that the Chariot Pushpaka was suddenly deprived of motion.", "\u201cThereupon that King of the Rakshasas, surrounded by his attendants, reflected:\u2014", "\u2018How is this, the chariot has halted? Why is it not still moving since it was created to follow its master\u2019s will? Wherefore does the Pushpaka Car not go wheresoever I desire? Is this not the doing of some inhabitant of the mountain\u2019?", "\u201cThen, O Rama, the intelligent Marica said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018It is not without reason, O King, that the Chariot Pushpaka moves no longer. Without doubt it is only able to serve Dhanada and, since it is separated from that Lord of Wealth, it has become motionless!\u2019", "\u201cAs he spoke thus, a fearful yellow and black-hued dwarf appeared, who was extremely stout and possessed a shaven head and short arms; it was Nandi. Approaching that Indra among the Rakshasas, that servant of Bhava, Nandi, fearlessly addressed him, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Begone, O Dashagriva, the Lord Shankara is disporting himself on this mountain; it is forbidden to birds, serpents, Yakshas, Devas, Gandharvas and Rakshasas to come hither!\u2019", "\u201cHearing Nandi\u2019s words, Ravana, with his earrings trembling in his wrath, his eyes red with fury, leapt down from the Pushpaka Chariot and approaching the foot of the peak, demanded:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Who is this Shankara?\u2019", "\u201cThen he beheld Nandi standing at the side of that God, supporting himself on his gleaming trident, blazing in his own effulgence, like unto a second Shankara.", "\u201cBeholding that monkey-faced One, the Rakshasa, in his contempt laughed derisively, roaring like a thunder-cloud.

Armed with nails and teeth, O Barbarian, they will descend like an avalanche of rocks, and swift as thought, thirsting to fight and, proud of their strength, shall crush your great pride and your high prowess with that of thine adherents and your sons. I am well able to slay you now, O Ranger of the Night, but it is no longer necessary to put you to death since your previous acts have already overtaken you.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these prophetic utterances of that magnanimous God, the celestial gongs resounded and a rain of flowers fell from the sky.", "Disregarding Nandi\u2019s words, the extremely powerful Dashanana drew nearer to the mountain and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018As it is on thine account that the course of Pushpaka, in which I was travelling, has been arrested, I shall uproot the mountain, O Cowherd! What is the nature of the power which enables Bhava to sport here continually like a king? He is not aware of what should be known to him and that the moment for him to tremble has come.\u2019", "\u201cSpeaking thus, O Rama, he seized the mountain in his arms and shook it violently so that the rocky mass vibrated. In consequence of the mountain quaking, the attendants of the God were troubled and Parvati herself, terrified, clung to the neck of Maheshwara.", "\u201cThen, O Rama, Mahadeva, the foremost of the Gods, as if in sport, pressed the mountain with his great toe and, at the same time, he crushed Ravana\u2019s arms, that resembled pillars of granite, to the great consternation of all the counsellors of that Rakshasa. And he, in pain and fury, suddenly let forth a terrible cry, causing the Three Worlds to tremble, so that his ministers thought it to be the crash of thunder at the dissolution of the worlds!", "Thereupon the Gods, with Indra at their head, stumbled on their way; the oceans became agitated, the mountains shook, and the Yakshas, Vidyadharas and Siddhas cried out:\u2014", "\u2018What is this?

Reaching the City of Ashma, he slew all the inhabitants and, with his sword, pierced his powerful brother-in-law, Vidyujjihva, the consort of Shurpanakha, who was proud of his strength and who, with his tongue, was licking a Rakshasa, preparatory to devouring him. Having slain him, Ravana thereafter, in an instant, destroyed four hundred Daityas.

As grass is consumed by fire so was that host of Rakshasas consumed by the King Mandhata by means of hundreds of Bushundis, Bhallas, Bhindipalas and Tomaras.

Then, setting the Raudra-weapon on his bow, Ravana discharged it, but Mandhata turned it aside with the Fire-weapon. Thereafter Dashanana took up the Gandharva weapon and King Mandhata the Brahma-astra, a source of terror to all. And Ravana took up the Celestial and dreadful Pashupata-weapon, the increaser of fear in the Three Worlds, obtained from Rudra, by virtue of his rigid penances.", "\u201cBeholding this, all moveable and immoveable beings were stricken with terror and the Three Worlds, including all that was animate and inanimate, Gods and Serpents, together took refuge in their abodes under the earth.", "\u201cMeantime, by virtue of their meditation, the two foremost of ascetics, Paulastya and Galava, aware of the conflict, remonstrated with these two warriors in various ways and restrained the King and the Lord of the Rakshasas.

Charitable acts of making many gifts of kine, gold and land are the hair in his armpits; the Mountains, Himalaya, Hemakuta, Mandara and Meru are his bones, the thunderbolt is in his palm, the sky in his frame, the evening rain-clouds are on his neck; the Creator and Preserver and the Vidyadharas are his arms; Ananta, Vasuki, Vishalaksha, Iravat, Kamvala, Asvatara, Karkotaka, Dhananjaya, the venomous Takshaka and Utpatakshaka have taken shelter under his nails in order to vomit forth their poison. Fire is in his mouth, the Rudras on his shoulders; the fortnights, months, years and seasons in his jaws, the lunar fortnight and the dark half of the month are his nostrils, the airy currents are the pores of his body, Sarasvati with her Vina is in his throat, the Asvins are in his ears and the sun and moon in his two eyes.", "\u201cO Rama, all the branches of the Veda and the sacrifices, the whole galaxy of stars, sweet speech, good deeds, energy and asceticism are supported by his body in human form.", "\u201cThen that Purusha struck Ravana playfully with his hands, which were as powerful as lightning and, thus assailed, Ravana fell to the ground immediately and having put that Night-ranger to flight that great Purusha, like unto the Rig-Veda, resembling a mountain be-decked with lotus wreaths, entered the region under the earth.", "\u201cThen Ravana addressed his counsellors thus:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Prahasta, O Shuka, O Sarana and you other ministers, where has that Purusha suddenly gone?

The breath of their sighing scorched the ear, lending the Pushpaka Chariot the appearance of a fire ceremony that is lit on all sides.", "\u201cFallen into the power of Dashagriva, those women were overcome with affliction and the sadness expressed in their looks and mien caused them to resemble black antelopes that have become a prey to a lion.

Woe unto the world! Assuredly none is more vile than the mighty Ravana, since under his blows our helpless consorts have perished, as stars disappear on the rising of the sun. Ah! That powerful Rakshasa takes delight in devising the means of our destruction! Alas! He gives himself up to evil without scruple, he is indifferent to every condemnation; till now none has been able to put an end to the exploits of this wicked wretch, yet it is a great sin to lay hands on other men\u2019s wives; this Rakshasa is the vilest of all since he seeks enjoyment with them. Because of this, a woman will be the cause of the death of this wicked being!\u2019", "\u201cWhen those virtuous and noble women had uttered these words, celestial gongs sounded and a shower of blossom fell. Cursed by his captives, Dashagriva seemed to lose all his power and glory and, hearing those women, who were chaste and devoted to their consorts, lamenting in this wise, that bull among the Rakshasas became distracted.", "\u201cThereafter he made his entry into the Gty of Lanka to the acclamations of the rangers of the night and, at that time, the fierce Rakshasi, who was able to change her form at will, the sister of Ravana, suddenly sank down on the earth before him, and Ravana, helping her to rise and comforting her, said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Dear One, what is this? Why dost you seek speech with me so urgently?\u2019", "\u201cThereupon, her eyes inflamed and suffused with tears, she said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O King, I have been widowed through your ruthless conduct! O Lord, your valour in combat has cut down those Daityas called Kalakeyas to the number of fourteen thousand and, in addition, my valiant lord who was dearer to me than life itself. He was slain by you, his foe, a brother in name only and, by you, I myself am slain, O Prince, you my kinsman! From now, I shall bear the title of widow through your fault!

I shall load you with gifts, homage and favours. In the heat of battle, being carried away by a desire to triumph, I loosed my shafts without being able to distinguish mine own people from others and did not recognize my brother-in-law whom I struck in the height of the conflict. That is how your consort fell under my blows in the fight. O My Sister, whatever presents itself at this time, I will do for your pleasure. It is for you to go and live near your kinsman, Khara, who enjoys sovereignty. Fourteen thousand Rakshasas will be made subject to that powerful Prince in the expeditions and distribution of spoils. There, that son of the sister of your mother, your cousin Khara, the Ranger of the Night, will ever be obedient to your commands. Let that warrior speedily go and guard the Dandaka Forest; Dushana shall be his commander; great is his valour. The courageous Khara shall ever obey your will and be the leader of the titans able to change their form at pleasure.\u2019", "\u201cHaving spoken thus, Dashagriva placed an army of fourteen thousand Rakshasas, full of valour, under Khara\u2019s command. Surrounded by all those titans of redoubtable appearance, Khara set out fearlessly at once to the Dandaka Forest. There he established his authority without hindrance and Shurpanakha dwelt near him in the forest.\u201d", "\u201cDashagriva, having given over that redoubtable army to Khara and consoled his sister, became master of himself once more and was freed from anxiety.", "\u201cThereafter that powerful Indra among the Rakshasas penetrated into the marvellous Nikumbhila Grove where he beheld hundreds of sacrificial posts and altars and, as if blazing in brilliance, a sacrifice was being performed.", "\u201cThere, clad in a black antelope skin, holding a coconut loshta and staff, he beheld his own son, Meghanada of dread aspect.", "Approaching him, the Lord of Lanka, clasping him in his arms, enquired of him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018What art you doing here, O Child, tell me truly!\u2019", "\u201cThen that excellent Twice-born of rigid penances, Ushanas [i.e., Sage Sukra], in order that the sacrifice should prove auspicious, answered Ravana, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018I shall tell you myself, O King, listen to all that has taken place. Seven sacrifices with countless preparatory rites have been undertaken by your son, the Agnisthoma, Ashvamedha, Bahus-vamaka, Rajasuya, Gomedha and the Vaishnava and, having engaged in die Maheshvara sacrifice, difficult for men to undertake, your son, on its completion, received gifts from the Lord of Creatures Himself: a stable and celestial chariot coursing at will in the sky, the power of illusion by which darkness is created on the field of battle so that even the Gods and Asuras can no longer find their way, and, in order to exterminate the foe in combat, O King, he has also been granted two inexhaustible quivers, a bow that no weapon can shatter and a powerful arrow. Having received these gifts, your son, O Dashanana, wishes to meet with you on the completion of the sacrifice and will soon present himself before you.\u2019", "\u201cThen Dashagriva said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018This is not well done, since our enemy, Indra, has been worshipped with these offerings. However, what is done is done and doubtless you will acquire merit thereby, let us now return, My Friend, and enter our abode.\u2019", "\u201cThereafter Dashagriva with his son and Bibishana returned to his dwelling and caused all the captives, who were crying and sobbing, to be brought down; and the virtuous Bibishana, being aware of his intention regarding those women, who were noble and veritable pearls, the offspring of the Gods, Danavas and Rakshasas, said to his brother:\u2014", "\u2018\u201cIt is practices such as these, which you dost follow with deliberate intention despite your knowledge of the causes of destruction of beings, that are ruinous to your good name, your family and fortune! After ill-treating their relatives, you have carried away these high-born women, whilst Madhu affronts you by carrying off Kumbhinasi,\u2019", "\u201cThen Ravana answered:\u2014\u2018I was not aware of this; who is this Madhu of whom you speakest?\u2019 and Bibishana replied to his brother indignantly and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Learn the consequences of thine evil karma! The elder brother of our maternal grandfather, Sumali, that virtuous old man named Malyavan, Ranger of the Night, the father of our mother, is the grandfather of Kumbhinasi, so that we are virtually her brothers. She has been borne away by Madhu, a Rakshasa of superior power, while your son was engaged in the sacrifice and I was bathing in the waters. Kumbhakarna, on his side, was still under the influence of sleep. Having slain the aged ministers, that foremost of night-rangers instantly carried away the princess most ruthlessly, though she was in the precincts of the inner apartments. Though these ill-tidings were known to us, we did not slay the ravisher since it is imperative that a young girl be provided with a consort by her brothers. This is the fruit of your perverse and wicked conduct which, as you seest, you are now reaping in this world itself.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words of Bibishana\u2019s, that Indra of the Rakshasas, Ravana, wrought up through die wickedness of his soul, like unto an ocean with surging waves, his eyes red with anger, said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Let my chariot be harnessed speedily, let my warriors stand ready with my brother Kumbhakarna and the foremost of the rangers of the night in their conveyances heaped with every weapon.

Ravana occupied the centre and Kumbhakarna the rearguard. As for the virtuous Bibishana, he remained in Lanka, faithful to his duty. All the other warriors advanced against Madhu\u2019s city and they were mounted on mules, buffalo, fiery steeds, porpoises and great serpents, covering the sky and, beholding Ravana on the march, hundreds of Daityas, who were at emnity with the Gods, followed him.", "\u201cMeanwhile Dashanana, having reached Madhupura, entered it, yet he did not find Madhu there but his own sister, who, paying obeisance to him, with a deep bow cast herself at his feet, for Kumbhinasi feared the Lord of the Rakshasas.", "\u201cThen he, raising her up, said to her:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Do not tremble!\u2019 and the King of the Rakshasas added \u2018What dost you desire of me?\u2019 Then she replied:\u2014", "\u2018O Long-armed Prince, if I find favour with you, then, 0 Proud Hero, do not slay my lord; it is not fitting to reduce women of nobility to such affliction. Of all ill-fortune, to become a widow is the greatest. Be true to your word, O Indra of Monarchs, and receive my supplication with favour. You have thyself said \u201cYou have nothing to fear!\u201d\u2019", "\u201cThen Ravana, in cheerful tones, answered his sister, who stood near him, saying:\u2014", "\u2018Where is your husband, tell me quickly! I shall go with him to conquer the region of the Gods. I shall not slay Madhu because of my tender affection for you.\u2019", "\u201cAt these words, Kumbhinasi roused her lord, that Ranger of the Night, who was sleeping profoundly and, in the height of joy, said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018My powerful brother, Dashagriva, is here, who desires to vanquish the world of the Gods; he has chosen you as his ally, therefore go, O Titan, with your kinsmen and lend him your strong support.

Having reached Kailasha, that mountain that served as Vaishravana\u2019s retreat, the Indra among the Rakshasas, like unto Mahendra, caused his army to set up camp.\u201d", "\u201cIt was on Kailasha, the sun having withdrawn behind the Astachala Range, that Dashagriva, full of vigour, chose to encamp the army.", "\u201cWhen the immaculate moon rose over the mountain with a splendour equal to his, the vast host that composed the army, fbrnished with diverse weapons, lay sleeping.", "\u201cThe mighty Ravana, resting on the summit of the mountain, surveyed the splendour of the forests in the light of the moon, the flaming Kamikara Woods, the Kadambas and Vakulas, pools covered with lotuses in bloom, the waters of the Manda-kini, the Champaka, Ashoka, Punnaga, Mandara, Cuta, Patala, Lodhra, Priyanga, Arjuna, Ketaka, Tagara, Narikela, Priyala, Panasa and other trees. Sweet-throated Kinneras, transported with love, sang melodies that ravished the soul with delight; there the Vidyadharas, intoxicated, their eyes inflamed, diverted themselves with their consorts. Like unto a carillon of bells, sweet music was heard from the troops of Apsaras who were singing in Dhanada\u2019s abode. Trees, shaken by the wind, covered the mountain with a shower of blossom, distilling the perfume of honey and mead, and a balmy breeze, laden with the enchanting aroma of nectar and pollen, blew, enhancing Ravana\u2019s voluptuous desire. The songs, the myriad flowers, the freshness of the breeze, the beauty of the mountain in the night, the moon at its zenith, threw Ravana, that mighty warrior, into a ferment of passion.", "\u201cMeanwhile, Rambha, loveliest of nymphs adorned with celestial ornaments, was on her way to a sacred festival and her face was like unto the full moon, her limbs smeared with sandalpaste, her hair sown with Mandara flowers, and she was garlanded with celestial blooms. Her eyes were beautiful, her waist high, adorned with a jewelled belt, and her hips were shapely, the gift of love as it were. She was enchanting with her countenance embellished with the marks of flowers that bloom in the six seasons and, in her beauty, stateliness, radiance and splendour, she resembled Shri. Swathed in a dark blue cloth, like unto a rain cloud, her countenance bright as the moon, her eyebrows resplendent arches, her hips like the tapering trunks of elephants, her hands like two fresh buds, under Ravana\u2019s eyes she passed through the ranks of the army.", "\u201cThereupon he, rising, pierced by the shafts of love, with his hand stayed the course of that nymph who was abashed and, smiling, enquired of her:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Where art you going, O Lady of lovely hips? What good fortune art you pursuing? For whom has this auspicious hour dawned? Who is about to enjoy you? Who, this day, will quaff the elixir of your lips exhaling the perfume of the lotus that rivals nectar or ambrosia? Who will caress those two breasts like unto twin goblets, rounded, blooming, that touch each other, O Youthful Woman? Who will stroke your large hips shining like refined gold covered with dazzling garlands, celestial to look upon? Is it Shakra or Vishnu or the Twin Ashvins? O Lovely One, if you dost pass me by in order to seek out another, it will not be a gracious act! Rest here, O Lady of lovely limbs, on this enchanting mountain side, it is I, who exercise dominion over the Three Worlds, who with joined palms address this humble request to you, I, Dashanana, Lord of the Three Worlds and their Ordainer, therefore grant my request.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words, Rambha, trembling, with joined palms, replied:\u2014", "\u2018Look on me with favour, it is not fitting that you should address me thus, you who art my superior! Rather is it your duty to protect me from others if I should be in danger of suffering violence at their hands, for apart from duty, I am virtually your daughter-in-law, I speak truth!\u2019", "\u201cThen Dashagriva answered Rambha, who had prostrated herself at his feet and whose hair stood on end merely on beholding him, and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Hadst you been my son\u2019s consort, you wouldst in effect be my daughter-in-law!\u2019", "Thereupon she answered:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Truly it is so, by law, I am the wife of your son and dearer to him than his life\u2019s breath, O Bull amongst the Rakshasas; he is the son of your brother Vaishravana, who is renowned in the Three Worlds, and is named Nalakuvara, an ascetic in virtue, a warrior in respect of valour and, in wrath he resembles Agni; in forbearance he is like unto the earth! I was going to meet that son of the Guardian of the Worlds; it is for his sake that I am adorned with these ornaments so that he and no other should enjoy me. For these reasons, let me go hence, O King, O Subduer of your Foes, for that virtuous prince awaits me impatiently. It is not for you to thwart his desires, let me go! Do you follow the path of the virtuous, O Bull among the Rakshasas! It is for me to pay you homage and for you to protect me!\u2019", "\u201cThus did she address Dashagriva, who answered her in smooth accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018You have said you are my daughter-in-law! For those who have but one husband, this argument is valid but in Devaloka, the Gods have established a law that is said to be eternal, that Apsaras have no appointed consorts nor are the Gods monogamous!\u2019", "\u201cThus speaking, the Rakshasa, who had stationed himself on the mountain ridge, inflamed with desire, ravished Rambha and, when she was released from his embrace, her garlands and her ornaments spoiled and torn away, she resembled a river where a great elephant, disporting himself, muddying the waters, has borne away the banks. Her hair in disorder, her hands clenched, like unto a creeper with its flowers shaken by the wind, trembling with terror, she sought out Nalakuvara and, with joined palms, fell at his feet.", "\u201cThen he enquired of her saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018What is this, O Blessed One? Why dost you prostrate thyself at my feet?\u2019", "\u201cThereupon she, sighing deeply, trembling, with joined palms began to tell him everything and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Lord, this night, Dashagriva scaled the Trivishtapa Peak while he was encamped on that mountain with his army and I was observed by him as I came to meet you, O Conqueror of Your Foes! That Rakshasa seized hold of me and questioned me saying \u201cTo whom dost you belong?\u201d Then I told him all, verily the whole truth, but he, intoxicated with desire, would not listen to me when I pleaded with him, saying \u201cI am your daughter-in-law!\u201d Refusing to listen to mine entreaties, he assaulted me ruthlessly! This is mine only fault, O You of firm vows, you should therefore pardon me. O Friend, verily there is no equality of strength between man and woman!\u2019", "\u201cThese words filled the son of Vaishravana with indignation and hearing of this supreme outrage, he entered into meditation and having ascertained the truth, the son of Vaishravana, his eyes inflamed with anger, instantly took water in his hand and sprinkled his whole person in accord with tradition, after which he pronounced a terrible curse on that Indra of the Rakshasas, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Since, despite your lack of love for him, he ravished you thus brutally, O Blessed One, on this account he will never be able to approach another youthful woman unless she shares his love; if, carried away by lust, he does violence to any woman who does not love him, his head will split into seven pieces.\u2019", "\u201cHaving uttered this curse like unto a scorching flame, celestial gongs resounded and a shower of flowers fell from the sky.

Do You grant me such assistance again which You didst accord me when I destroyed Namuchi, Vritra, Bali, Naraka and Shambara! O Lord, O God of Gods, Slayer of Madhu, there is no refuge save You in the Three Worlds with all the animate and inanimate beings. You are the blessed Narayana, the eternal lotus-born One; You are the Sustainer of the Worlds and of myself, Shakra, the King of the Gods; You have created the Three Worlds with all the moving and unmoving objects and, at the end of the world cycle, all is withdrawn into You, O Bhagavat; therefore, O God of Gods, tell me truly if You will arm Thyself with sword and discus in order to enter into combat with Ravana?\u2019", "\u201cThus spoke Shakra, the King of the Gods, and that sovereign Lord, Narayana, answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Fear not!

Intoxicated with his power, that Rakshasa, accompanied by his son, will certainly achieve a great feat. As for your request, that I should enter into combat with him, I shall certainly not meet the Rakshasa Ravana in fight, for Vishnu never leaves the battlefield without laying his adversary low; it is not possible to accomplish this to-day since Ravana is protected by die boon, but I swear to you, O King of the Gods, Shatakratu, that I myself will become the cause of that titan\u2019s death.

Thus I made a female, who on occount of the grace of her limbs became known as Ahalya; \u201cHala\u201d meaning ugly, from which \u201cHalya\u201d is derived, and she in whom \u201cHalya\u201d does not appear is named Ahalya; this was the name I called her.

That virtuous and renowned Muni was gratified with her company but the Gods were in despair because she had been given to Gautama and you, enraged, your heart filled with desire, went to the hermitage of the Sage and beheld the woman who was as radiant as a flame in a brazier, whereupon you didst ravish her in the heat of your passion.

Having paid homage to that symbol that delivers all beings from their sufferings and which was large and exceedingly beautiful, adorned with a crescent moon, that Ranger of the Night, with uplifted arms, danced and sang before it.\u201d", "\" Not far from where the dread Lord of the Rakshasas was making his offering of flowers on the sandy banks of the Narmada, Arjuna, the foremost of conquerors, supreme sovereign of Mahishmati, was sporting with his wives in the waters of that river. In their midst, that monarch looked like a great tusker surrounded by innumerable female elephants. Then he, desiring to measure the great strength of his thousand arms, stayed the rapid course of the Narmada and, the waters thus arrested by the myriad arms of Kartavirya, flowed towards its source bearing away its banks. With its fishes, crocodiles and sharks, its carpet of flowers and Kusha Grass, the current of the Narmada grew turbulent, as in the rainy season, and, as if purposely released by Kartavirya, that flood bore away all Ravana\u2019s floral offerings, whereupon he, leaving the sacrifice only half performed, cast his glance on the river that appeared to him to resemble a cherished consort who is overwrought.", "\u201cHaving surveyed the waters rising like waves in the sea, rushing from the west to overwhelm the eastern shore, Ravana observed that, in a little while, the birds no longer shunned it and it had returned to its natural state, like a woman who is pacified.", "\u201cPointing with the finger of his right hand, Dashagriva signalled to Shuka and Sarana that they should seek out the cause of the rising current and, at this command from their king, the two brothers, Shuka and Sarana rose into the air and turned westward. Having traversed two miles, those Nightrangers observed a man in the river sporting with some women and he resembled a huge Sala Tree, his hair floating in the stream and the corners of his eyes were inflamed by the desire which agitated his heart. And that Scourge of his Foes blocked the river with his myriad arms, as a mountain the earth with its countless slopes and foot-hills, and innumerable fair women surrounded him, as a tusker in rut is encircled by female elephants.", "\u201cBeholding that prodigious sight, the two Rakshasas, Shuka and Sarana returned together to Ravana and said to him:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Prince of the Rakshasas, an unknown person, like unto an enormous Sala Tree, in order to amuse his consorts, is staying the course of the Narmada like a dyke. Restrained by his myriad arms, the river is throwing up great waves like unto the sea!\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words from Shuka and Sarana, Ravana said, \u2018It is Arjuna\u2019 and rushed away, eager to enter into combat with him. And, as Ravana, the Lord of the Rakshasas, set forth to meet Arjuna, a fierce dust storm arose accompanied by muttering clouds raining drops of blood and that Indra among the Rakshasas, escorted by Mahodara, Mahaparshva, Dhumraksha, Shuka and Sarana, proceeded in the direction where Arjuna was. Soon that mighty Rakshasa, of the hue of antimony, reached the waters of the Narmada and there, surrounded by his wives, as a tusker by female elephants, the foremost of monarchs, Arjuna appeared before him.", "Then the Lord of the Rakshasas, who was intoxicated with power, his eyes red with anger, said to Arjuna\u2019s ministers in stentorian tones:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Counsellors of the Lord Haihaya, inform him speedily that he who is called Ravana has come to fight with him!\u2019", "\u201cWhen they heard these words of Ravana, Arjuna\u2019s ministers raised their weapons and answered him saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Ravana, you have indeed chosen an excellent moment for combat! Wouldst you fight a prince who is drunk and who is, further, amidst his consorts? Dost you really desire to fight with our king whilst he is surrounded by his wives? Possess thyself in patience to-day, O Dashagriva, and when the night is over, if you still wishest to do so, then challenge Arjuna, O Dear Friend. If, however, you are bent on combat, O You sated with war, then overcome us here and thereafter meet Arjuna and fight with him.\u2019", "\u201cThen Ravana\u2019s ministers slew some of Arjuna\u2019s counsellors and devoured them avidly, and a great uproar arose on the banks of the Narmada, from the followers of Arjuna and Ravana\u2019s ministers. The soldiers of the King of the Haihayas assailed Ravana and his ministers, on whom they hurled themselves with appalling fury with arrows, darts, javelins and tridents that pierced like lightning, and they created a tumult like unto the sea with its crocodiles, fish and sharks.", "\u201cMeanwhile the ministers of Ravana, Prahasta, Shuka and Sarana, enraged and full of valour, decimated the army of Kartavirya, and Arjuna\u2019s followers, mad with terror, informed him of the attack by Ravana and his ministers.", "\u201cOn these tidings, Arjuna addressed the concourse of women, saying:\u2014\u2018Have no fear\u2019, and rushed out of the water, like another Pavaka emitting terrible flames, so that he resembled the Fire of Dissolution at the end of the World Period. Adorned with bracelets of refined gold, he at once seized hold of a mace and hurled himself on the Rakshasas, whom he dispersed as the sun the darkness. With his arms, Arjuna, having brandished the huge mace, let it fall with the force of Garuda\u2019s flight.", "\u201cThen Prahasta, unshakeable, like unto a hill, mace in hand, stood barring his path, like unto the Vindhya Range obstructing the sun, and he hurled that dreadful weapon bound with copper, emitting a great shout like unto Antaka. At the tip of the pike, loosed by Prahasta\u2019s hand, a brilliant flame appeared like the point of an Ashoka Tree that seemed to glow, but the son of Kritavirya, Arjuna, without being perturbed, skilfully deflected that mace that was falling upon him, with his own weapon. Then the supreme Lord of the Haihayas hurled himself on his adversary with his heavy weapon which he brandished in his five hundred arms.", "\u201cStruck by that powerful blow of the mace, Prahasta, who had confronted him, fell like a mountain that has been riven by Indra\u2019s thunderbolt.", "\u201cSeeing Prahasta lying there, Marica, Shuka and Sarana, as also Mahodara and Dhumraksha fled from the battlefield.", "\u201cHis ministers routed and Prahasta struck down, Ravana threw himself on Arjuna, the foremost of monarchs, and a formidable duel ensued between that king of a myriad arms and the twenty-armed Ravana causing the hair to stand on end. Like unto two oceans that overflow, two mountains shaken to their foundations, two flaming suns, two blazing fires, two elephants intoxicated with their own strength, two bulls fighting for a heifer, two muttering clouds, two lions proud of their strength, like unto Rudra and Kala enraged, so did the Rakshasa and the King Arjuna, armed with maces, assail each other with fearful blows. Resembling mountains, able to withstand the dreadful lightning strokes, so did man and Rakshasa endure the blows of the mace. As the noise of thunder creates reverberations, so the impact of those weapons resounded in every quarter. Arjuna\u2019s mace, falling on his opponent\u2019s breast, lent it the appearance of gold or a cloud illumined by lightning. In the same way, each time Ravana\u2019s mace fell on Arjuna\u2019s breast, it resembled a meteor falling on a high mountain. Neither Arjuna nor the Sovereign of the Rakshasas wearied in the struggle, which remained undecided as formerly the duel between Bali and Indra. As two bulls struggle with their horns or two elephants with their sharp tusks, so did those two most valiant of men and Rakshasas fight. Finally Arjuna, in fury, with all his strength struck the huge chest of Ravana with his mace, but, protected by the armour bestowed on him by Brahma as a boon, that weapon was rendered impotent and fell cloven on the earth. Under the blow dealt by Arjuna, however, Ravana fell back a bow\u2019s length and sank down groaning.", "\u201cPerceiving him to be overcome, Arjuna immediately rushed on Dashagriva and seized hold of him as Garuda did a serpent. With his myriad arms, that mighty king took hold of Dashanana and bound him as Narayana had bound Bali.", "\u201cRavana, having been made captive, all the Siddhas, Char-anas and Devatas cried out, \u2018Well done 1 Well done 1\u2019 and showered flowers on Arjuna\u2019s head. As a tiger who has captured a gazelle or a lion an elephant, so did the King of the Haihayas emit loud roars like unto a cloud.", "\u201cThereafter the night-ranger, Prahasta, having recovered consciousness, seeing Dashanana bound, rushed on Arjuna in fury and the forces of the Rakshasas assailed him with extreme violence as, at the end of the hot season, the rain-douds break over the ocean.", "\u201c\u2018Release him! Release him!\u2019 they cried unceasingly, attacking Arjuna with iron bars and spears but, entirely unmoved by the hail of weapons, ere they could reach him, the intrepid King of the Haihayas, Scourge of his Foes, speedily took hold of those projectiles hurled at him by the enemies of the Gods, and by means of many a dreadful and irresistible missile, he put them to flight as the wind disperses the clouds.", "\u201cHaving scattered the Rakshasas, Arjuna, the son of Krita-virya, surrounded by his friends, bearing Ravana, bound, returned to his city. Then the Twice-born and the people scattered flowers and rice upon him, as he made his entry into the capital, resembling the God of a Thousand Eyes when he captured Bali.\u201d", "\u201cHearing from the Gods in heaven of Ravana\u2019s capture, which resembled the binding of the wind, Paulastya, despite his self-mastery, was moved by tender affection for his offspring and approached the Lord of Mahishmati. Entering the path of the wind, whom he equalled in velocity, that Twice-born One, with the swiftness of thought, reached the City of Mahishmati and, as Brahma enters Indra\u2019s capital, he penetrated into that city that resembled Amaravati and was full of prosperous and cheerful people.", "\u201cWalking on foot, he advanced like unto the sun with such effulgence that the eye could scarcely rest upon him and, beholding him, the inhabitants hastened to inform Arjuna.", "\u201c\u2018It is Paulastya\u2019, said that Sovereign of the Haihayas on perceiving him, whereupon, with joined palms, he touched his forehead in salutation as he went forward to meet the ascetic. Like Brihaspati before Shakra so did the Purohita precede the king, bearing the Arghya and also the Madhuparka offerings.", "\u201cThereafter the Rishi drew near like unto die rising sun, and Arjuna, deeply moved on beholding him, paid obeisance to him as Indra offers reverence to Brahma.", "Presenting him with the Madhuparka, a cow, and water wherewith to wash his feet, as also the Arghya, that Indra among Monarchs addressed Paulastya in a voice trembling with delight and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Since I behold you, O You whose sight is hard to obtain, to-day Mahishmati has become the equal of Amaravati, O Foremost of the Twice-born 1 To-day I am happy, O Lord, to-day, my desires are consummated; to-day my birth is rendered fruitful; to-day, my penance has been blessed since I now embrace your two feet that are worshipped by the Celestial Host. Here is my kingdom and here my sons and my consorts at your service; what are your commands?\u2019", "\u201cThen Paulastya, having enquired concerning his welfare, the discharge of his duty and the sacrificial fires and his offspring, said to the Sovereign of the Haihayas:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Foremost of Kings, whose eyes are as large as lotus petals, whose face shines like the full moon, none is equal to you in strength since you have conquered Dashagriva, he, before whom, the ocean and the wind are stayed and remain motionless in fear, he, my grandson whom you didst make captive on the battlefield, who till now was invincible. You have swallowed his glory and rendered your name illustrious. O Dear Friend, on my request, now release Dashanana!\u2019", "\u201cThereupon Arjuna, without uttering a word, having listened to Paulastya\u2019s appeal, cheerfully released the foremost of the Rakshasas and, having set that enemy of the Gods free, Arjuna honoured him with jewels, garlands and celestial raiment and contracted an alliance with him in the presence of fire, then, prostrating himself at the feet of Brahma\u2019s son,1 he returned to his abode.", "\u201cThereafter Paulastya himself dismissed the powerful Lord of the Rakshasas after embracing him and he, having received hospitality, departed, ashamed at his defeat, whilst Paulastya, the son of that Grandsire of the World, he the foremost of Munis, who had just delivered Dashagriva, returned to Brahma-Ioka.", "\u201cThus, despite his immense strength, was Ravana, who had been defeated by Kartavirya, released at Paulastya\u2019s request. So are the mighty overcome by those who are still mightier than they, O You, who increases the felicity of the Raghavas! He who desires his own happiness should not despise his adversaries.", "\u201cMeanwhile the Lord of those eaters of flesh, having contracted a friendship with that thousand-armed monarch, began to range the earth full of arrogance, overcoming its rulers.\u201d", "\u201cReleased by Arjuna, Ravana, the Lord of the Rakshasas, unwearyingly ranged the earth and whenever he heard of any who was possessed of extraordinary strength, whether man or titan, in his arrogance he sought him out in order to provoke him to combat.", "\u201cOne day he came to the city of Kishkindha and challenged King Bali of the golden diadem.", "There he found the kinsfolk of that monkey only, Tara, her father Sushena and the Lord Sugriva, who answered that belligerent one, who had just come, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O King of the Rakshasas, Bali, who would have accepted your challenge, is not here, what other Plavamgama is able to meet you in combat? Bali has gone to the four oceans to perform the Sandhya Ceremony, O Ravana, he will soon return, have patience awhile! That heap of bones, white as conch shells, belongs to those who desired to measure their strength in combat with the Lord of the Vanaras, O Prince. Even hadst you sucked the nectar of immortality, O Ravana, your meeting with Bali would put an end to thine existence. O Son of Vish-ravas, look upon this marvellous universe once more for soon it will no longer be possible for you to do so. Since you are in haste to die, however, go to the southern sea where you will behold Bali who resembles the Deity of Fire.\u2019", "\u201cThereupon, having inveighed against Tara and the others, Ravana, that Ravana of the Worlds, remounted his Chariot Pushpaka and drove towards the southern sea. There he beheld Bali, like unto a mountain of gold, absorbed in the performance of Sandhya.", "\u201cDescending from the Pushpaka Car, Ravana of the hue of collyrium, stole upon Bali silently in order to seize him, but by chance, he was observed by him who had no doubts as to his fell design, though Bali remained unmoved like a lion in the presence of a hare or Garuda before a serpent, and he was in no wise perturbed by Ravana of malevolent intent.", "\u201cHe reflected, \u2018This is Ravana, who with malice in his soul, approaches in order to seize hold of me. I shall hang him on my girdle and go to the three other oceans, then all will behold mine adversary, Dashagriva, his arms and limbs and his raiment dangling, hooked to my side like a snake caught by Garuda.\u2019", "\u201cThinking thus, Bali remained there reciting his Vedic Mantras in a low voice, like unto the King of the Mountains. Each desiring to lay hold on the other, in the pride their strength inspired in them, the Sovereign of the Monkeys and the Lord of the Rakshasas sought to realise their design.", "\u201cPerceiving by the sound of his footsteps that Ravana was about to place his hands upon him, Bali, though his back was turned, caught hold of the titan as Garuda a serpent and, having seized the Lord of the Rakshasas, hooked him to his girdle, thereupon that monkey, with one bound, sprang into the air, and though lacerated and torn by his nails, Bali carried off Ravana as a tempest propels a cloud.", "\u201cMeantime the ministers of Dashanana, whom he was bearing away, fell upon Bali emitting loud cries in order to make him release him. Pursued by them, Bali, in his aerial course, shone like the sun that is followed by a drift of clouds in space. Those foremost of the Rakshasas, exhausted by the wind that caused their arms and thighs to shake, were stayed in their course, and the mountains themselves made way for Bali, how much more those who, made of flesh and blood, sought to survive. With a speed impossible to flocks of birds, that Indra among monkeys, in great haste, paid obeisance to all the oceans in turn and, at dusk, received the homage of all winged creatures on the way, he, the foremost among them; thereafter with Ravana he finally reached the Western Sea. There that monkey performed the Sandhya Ceremony and, having bathed, still bearing Dashanana, went to the Northern Sea. Thereafter that great monkey with his adversary traversed thousands of leagues, swift as the wind or thought. Having observed the Sandhya Ceremony at the Northern Sea, Bali, carrying Dashanana, went to the Eastern Sea. There, Vasavi, the Lord of the Monkeys, performed his evening devotions and, still bearing Ravana, he returned to Kishkindha. Having performed the Sandhya at the four oceans, that monkey, weary of supporting Ravana, halted in a wood near Kishkindha and that King of the Monkeys, unhooking Ravana from his girdle, with a mocking laugh, said:\u2014\u2018Whence art you?\u2019", "\u201cGreatly astonished, the King of the Rakshasas, whose eyes were half-dosed with fatigue, addressed the Lord of the Monkeys thus:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Foremost of Monkeys, O You who resemblest Mahendra, I am the Lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, who came in the hope of entering into combat with you and here I am, your captive! What strength, what energy, what inner power has enabled you to bind me thus without fatigue and with such speed, O Valiant Monkey? Assuredly there are only three beings who could have acted thus, the mind, the wind and Suparna. Having witnessed your power, O Bull among Monkeys, in the presence of fire I wish to enter into an alliance of sincere and enduring friendship with you! Consorts, sons, city, kingdom, pleasures, raiment and food will all be shared by us, O King, O Foremost of the Monkeys!\u2019", "\u201cThereupon, lighting a fire, monkey and titan became brothers and embraced each other. Clasping hands, the monkey and the titan joyfully entered Kishkindha, like unto two lions into a rocky cavern. Resembling another Sugriva, Ravana sojourned there for a month and thereafter his ministers desirous of overcoming the Three Worlds, led him away.", "\u201cThus did Ravana act with Bali formerly and, although humbled by him, swore to be his brother in the presence of fire. Bali\u2019s strength was unequalled, O Rama, it was immeasurable; yet you didst consume him as the fire a cricket.\u201d", "Then Rama made a further enquiry of that Sage, whose hermitage was in the southern region and, paying obeisance to him in great reverence, with joined palms addressed him in pregnant terms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAssuredly the prowess of Bali and Ravana was incomparable, yet, to my mind at least, it was never equal to Hanuman\u2019s 1 Courage, skill, strength, tenacity of purpose, sagacity, experience, energy and prowess are all to be found in Hanuman!", "\u201cWhen beholding the Ocean, the army of the monkeys was in despair, that long-armed hero consoled them, traversing a hundred leagues and destroying the City of Lanka. Entering Ravana\u2019s inner apartments, he discovered Sita and encouraged her by his words. Single-handed, Hanuman slew those who marched at the head of the enemy forces, the sons of Ravana\u2019s ministers, the Kinkaras, and thereafter, when he had broken his fetters and admonished Dashanana, he reduced Lanka to ashes as Pavaka the world. Such feats were never surpassed by Indra, Varuna, Vishnu or Kuvera. By the might of his arms, I have conquered Lanka and regained Sita, Lakshmana, my kingdom, friends and kinsfolk. Who but Hanuman, the companion of the King of the Vanaras, would have been capable of obtaining tidings of Janaki? But how comes it, that in his devotion to Sugriva, he did not consume Bali at the time of the quarrel, as a fire a shrub? It seems to me that Hanuman was not yet aware of his powers when he witnessed the King of the Monkeys, whom he loved as his own being, set at nought! Recount to me in detail and candidly everything concerning Hanuman, O Blessed and Illustrious Ascetic, O You whom the Gods revere!\u201d", "Hearing these sagacious words, the Sage, in Hanuman\u2019s presence, answered:\u2014", "\u201cWhat you have said regarding Hanuman is true, O Prince of the Raghus! I deem none is equal to him in strength or surpasses him in swiftness and intelligence but formerly an irrevocable curse was pronounced on him by the Sages, on account of which, that hero was made unconscious of his great power, O Scourge of your Foes.", "\u201cIn his childhood, O Mighty Rama, he did something of which I cannot speak, so puerile was it, but if you so desirest, O Raghava, I will disclose it to you.", "\u201cThere is a mountain named Sumeru that Surya gilds as a boon; there Kesharin, the sire of Hanuman, dwells. Vayu begot a wonderful child on his cherished and illustrious consort, Anjana, and she brought that son, whose colour was like unto an ear of com, into the world. Wishing to pluck some fruits, that lovely woman penetrated into a thicket, and the child, who in his mother\u2019s absence suffered greatly from hunger, began to emit piercing cries, like unto Karttikeya in the Shara Wood.", "\u201cAt that moment, he observed the sun rising like unto a bunch of Java flowers, and, eager for food, he imagined it to be a fruit and rushed towards it. Turning to the rising sun, the child, himself like unto the dawn, wishing to lay hold of it, sprang into the sky.", "And Hanuman\u2019s bounds, he being but a child, greatly astonished the Devas, Danavas and Yakshas who reflected,", "\u2018Neither Vayu, Garuda nor even thought itself have the velocity of this son of the Wind who has leapt into the sky. If, whilst still a child, the speed of his flight is such, what will it not be when he attains his youthful strength.\u2019", "\u201cNow Vayu followed in his son\u2019s wake lest the sun should scorch him and protected him with his cooling breath. Thus Hanuman, rising in space, traversed thousands of leagues and, on account of his sire\u2019s power and his own guilelessness, drew near to the sun.", "\u201c\u2018That little One is not conscious of his error\u2019 reflected Surya, \u2018we must act accordingly\u2019, and he refrained from consuming him.", "\u201cNow on that very day that Hanuman sprang into the sky to seize hold of the solar orb, Rahu [i.e., The demon who causes the sun\u2019s periodic eclipse.] had prepared to take hold of it himself and, coming in contact with that child in the sun\u2019s chariot, Rahu sprang away in fear, he, the scourge of the sun and moon.", "Provoked, that son of Simhika went to Indra\u2019s abode and, scowling, said to that God, who was surrounded by the Celestial Host:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Vasava, in order to satisfy my hunger, you didst bestow the sun and moon on me, why hast you made a present of them to another, O Slayer of Bali and Vritra? To-day, which is the time of the conjunction, I had gone to lay hold of the sun when another Rahu approached and seized it.\u2019", "\u201cHearing these words of Rahu, Vasava, astonished, rose up from his throne and bearing his golden diadem, went out. Thereafter he mounted Airavata, foremost of elephants, who was as high as a hill or the peak of Mount Kailasha with his four tusks, running with mada juice, enormous, richly caparisoned and whose golden bells rang merrily.", "\u201cThen Indra commanded Rahu to precede him and directed his course to where Surya and Hanuman were. Thereupon Rahu set out with all speed leaving Vasava far behind and the child, Hanuman, beheld him as he drew near, whereupon he let go of the sun and, taking Rahu to be a fruit, once more bounded into the sky to seize Simhika\u2019s son.", "\u201cObserving that Plavamgama loosing his hold on the sun in order to throw himself upon him, the offspring of Simhika, of whom the head alone remained visible, taking refuge under Indra\u2019s protection, in his terror, cried out \u2018Indra, Indra\u2019 without ceasing, and Indra, recognizing the voice of Rahu ere he was able to discern him, answered his appeal, saying \u2018Have no fear, I am about to slay him!\u2019", "\u201cMeantime, beholding Airavata, Maruti reflected \u2018O, the lovely fruit!\u2019 and threw himself on that Lord of Elephants and while he sought to take hold of Airavata, his form fearful to behold suddenly appeared over Indra and his followers. Thereafter as he rushed on Saci\u2019s consort, Indra, not unduly angered, with his finger loosed a thunderbolt that struck Hanuman and, at the impact, the child fell on a mountain, in his fall breaking his left jaw. Seeing his son lying inanimate under the stroke of the thunderbolt, Pavana was enraged against Indra, and the God Maruta, who penetrates and infuses all beings, withdrew into a cave to which he bore his child. Thereafter, as Vasava restrains the floods, he caused immense sufferings to all beings by preventing the passage of excreta and urine in them.", "\u201cOn account of Vayu\u2019s wrath all creatures on every side were deprived of their breath so that their joints were dislocated and they became as blocks of wood.

Heavenly trees of graceful shape, thick with heavy foliage and enchanting blossom were humming with intoxicated bees. Kokilas, Bhringarajas and other birds of varied plumage, their heads crowned with pollen from the Mango Trees, added to the beauty of those marvellous woods.

That grove was enclosed by flat rocks of differing forms within which were many grassy glades of the sheen of emerald and pearl, and these were adorned by trees rivalling each other in the profusion of their blossom, the earth beneath being heaped with flowers, resembling the sky full of stars, so that it appeared like the garden of Indra or Caitaratha created by Brahma.", "Such was Rama\u2019s pastoral retreat with its arbours filled with countless seats and grassy couches inviting one to rest; and the Increaser of Raghu\u2019s joy entered that magnificent Ashoka Grove and seated himself on a throne of great splendour which was decorated with innumerable flowers and covered with a carpet of Kusha Grass.", "Taking Sita by the hand, Kakutstha gave her delicious wine made of distilled honey to drink, as formerly Purandara had offered to Saci. Thereafter pure viands and fruits of every kind were brought by servants, whilst lovely Apsaras, skilled in the arts of singing and dancing, began to perform in the Prince\u2019s presence and troops of Nymphs and Uragas, surrounded by the Kinneris intoxicated with wine, danced before Kakutstha, and the virtuous Rama, the most captivating of warriors, delighted those ravishing and charming women.", "Seated by Vaidehi, he was radiant with splendour and resembled Vasishtha at the side of Arundhati. In this way, in the joy that possessed him, Rama, like unto a God, each day prepared some new delight for Sita, the Princess of Videha, who was like unto the daughter of a Celestial Being.", "While Sita and Raghava sported thus for a long time, the flowery season, that yields perpetual enjoyment, passed away and, as those two tasted every kind of felicity, Spring appeared once more. One day, having fulfilled the functions of state, that virtuous Prince returned to his palace where he spent the rest of the day. On her side, Sita, having worshipped the Gods and performed her morning duties, offering her services to all her mothers-in-law without distinction, thereafter adorned herself with marvellous jewels and re-joined Rama, like unto Saci when re-united with that God of a Thousand Eyes as he returns to his City Trivishtapa.", "Beholding his consort glowing with beauty, Raghava experienced an unequalled delight and exclaimed \u201cIt is well!\u201d then he addressed the lovely Sita, who resembled a daughter of the Gods, and said:\u2014", "\u201cNow, O Vaidehi, that you dost bear a child in your womb, what dost you desire, O Lady of lovely hips? What pleasure can I prepare for you?\u201d", "Smiling, Vaidehi answered Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Raghava, I wish to visit the sacred retreats of the Rishis of rigid penances, who dwell on the banks of the Ganges where they subsist on fruit and roots, and there I will throw myself at their feet, O Lord. O Kakutstha, it is my supreme desire even to pass a night in the hermitage of these ascetics who live on fruit and roots.\u201d", "Then Rama of imperishable exploits gave her permission to do so, saying:\u2014", "\u201cBe at peace, O Vaidehi, to-morrow without fail, you shalt go there!\u201d", "Having answered Maithili, born of Janaka, in this wise, Kakutstha went to the central court surrounded by his friends.", "Having entered there, the King was surrounded by entertaining companions accustomed to the exchange of humorous experiences, Vijaya, Madhumatta, Kashyapa, Mangala, Kula, Suraji, Kaliya, Bhadra, Dantavakra and Sumagadha, and they beguiled the magnanimous Raghava with amusing tales of every kind amidst great merriment.", "Raghava, however, during some narrative, enquired of Bhadra, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Bhadra, what do they say of me in the town and country?

When I learn of them, I shall endeavour to do what is meet in the future and eschew what is evil. Tell me all in full confidence without fear. Laying aside every scruple, relate all the rumours current about me in the kingdom!\u201d", "Thus exhorted by Raghava, Bhadra, with joined palms, in profound reverence, addressed that mighty hero in measured tones, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHear, O King, what the people are saying, be it good or ill, in the highways, markets, streets, woods and parks\u2014", "\u2018Rama has achieved the impossible by throwing a bridge over the sea which to our knowledge was never done by his predecessors nor even by the Gods and Danavas together. With his foot-soldiers and cavalry, he has destroyed the invincible Ravana and has made the monkeys, bears and Rakshasas subject to him. Having slain Ravana in the fight and recovered Sita, Raghava, having mastered his anger, has taken his spouse into his house again. What pleasure can his heart experience in possessing Sita, whom Ravana formerly held in his lap, having borne her away by force? How is it that Rama was not filled with aversion for her after she had been taken to Lanka and conducted to the Ashoka Grove, where she was left to the mercy of the titans? We shall now have to countenance the same state of affairs regarding our own wives, since what a king does, his subjects follow!\u2019", "\u201cThese are the sayings current everywhere among the people of town and country, O King.\u201d", "At these words, Raghava, stricken with grief, asked, \u201cIs it thus that they speak of me?\u201d", "Then all, bowing to the ground in reverence, answered the unfortunate Raghava and said:\u2014", "\u201cIt is true, O Lord of the Earth I\u201d", "Having heard their unanimous testimony, Kakutstha, the Scourge of His Foes, dismissed his companions.", "Having dismissed his companions, Raghava began to ponder within himself and thereafter said to the doorkeeper who stood near:\u2014", "\u201cGo speedily and seek out the son of Sumitra, Lakshmana of auspicious marks and the fortunate Bharata and the invincible Shatrughna.\u201d", "At Rama\u2019s command, the janitor paid obeisance with joined palms and went to Lakshmana\u2019s abode which he entered unchallenged and there, having saluted the magnanimous prince, he said", "\u201cThe King desires to see you, do you go to him without delay!\u201d", "\u201cIt is well!\u201d answered Saumitri and, in obedience to Rag-hava\u2019s command, he ascended a chariot and hastened to the palace. When he had departed, the doorkeeper approached Bharata and, saluting him in a like manner, said:\u2014", "\u201cThe king respectfully requests your presence!\u201d", "Hearing these instructions issued by Rama, Bharata, rising swiftly from his seat, started out hurriedly on foot. Beholding the virtuous Bharata going away, the messenger speedily approached Shatrughna\u2019s abode and, with joined palms, addressed him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cGo quickly, O Prince of the Raghus, the king wishes to see you; Lakshmana has already preceded you as also the renowned Bharata.\u201d", "At these words, Shatrughna descended from his throne and, bowing to the ground, went to rejoin Raghava.", "Meantime the messenger having returned, paid obeisance to Rama and made it known to him that his brothers had come. Learning of the youthful princes\u2019 arrival, Rama, who was deeply troubled, with a downcast mien, sad at heart, said to the doorkeeper:\u2014", "\u201cMake haste and usher them into my presence! Mine existence depends on them, they are my very life\u2019s breath!\u201d", "At this command from that Indra of Men, the princes, attired in white, bowed with joined palms and entered respectfully. On beholding Rama, who resembled the moon in eclipse or the sun that the dusk robs of its splendour, whose eyes were filled with tears and who looked like a lotus bereft of its brilliance, they placed their heads at his feet and then stood silent. Thereupon the mighty Rama, shedding tears, having raised them up, clasped them in his arms and said to them:\u2014", "\u201cBe seated! You are my whole wealth, you are my very life! It is with your assistance that I attained a kingdom and now rule, O Princes!\u201d", "Thus spoke Kakutstha and all, attentive and deeply moved, wondered what words he might be about to address to them.", "All having taken their places full of sadness, Kakutstha, his features stricken, said to them:\u2014", "\u201cHear me all of you, may good betide you! Do not let your attention wander! This is what people are saying about me concerning Sita! The inhabitants of the city as also those of the country censure me severely and their criticism pierces my heart 1 I am born in the Race of the illustrious Ikshvakus and Sita belongs to the family of the great-souled Janaka. My Dear Lakshmana, you knowest how, in the lonely forest, Ravana bore Sita away and that I destroyed him. It was then that the thought came to me regarding the daughter of Janaka, \u2018How can I bring Sita back to Ayodhya from this place?\u2019 Thereupon, in order to re-assure me, Sita entered the fire in my presence and that of the Gods, O Saumitri 1 Agni, the Bearer of sacrificial offerings, witnessed to Maithili\u2019s innocence and Vayu also, who was then journeying through space, and Candra and Aditya proclaimed it formerly before the Gods and all the Rishis, that the daughter of Janaka was without fault. The Gods and Gandharvas testified to her pure conduct in Lanka, where Mahendra placed the proofs in my hand, further I knew from my own inner being that the illustrious Sita was innocent. It was then that I took her back and returned to Ayodhya. Since then a great sadness, on hearing the censure of the people of town and country, has filled my heart. Whoever it may be, if his ill fame be current in the world, he falls to a lower state, so long as the defamatory rumours exist. Dishonour is condemned by the Gods; honour is revered in the world and, it is on account of fair repute, that great souls act. As for me, so greatly do I fear dishonour that I would renounce my life and you yourselves on its account, O Bulls among Men, how much more therefore is it incumbent on me to separate myself from the daughter of Janaka. See therefore in what an ocean of grief I have fallen! There is no misfortune greater than this 1 To-morrow, at dawn, O Saumitri, take my chariot with Sumantra as your charioteer and, causing Sita to ascend it, leave her beyond the confines of the kingdom.", "\u201cOn the further side of the Ganges, the magnanimous Valmiki has his hermitage of celestial aspect situated by the Tamasa; it is in a solitary spot that you should leave her, O You who art the Joy of the House of Raghu. Go quickly, O Saumitri, and carry out my behest. Do not discuss it in any way; go therefore, O Saumitri, it is not the time for observations. Any resistence on your part will cause me extreme displeasure. Yea, I swear to you by my two feet, by my life, that those who seek to make me alter my resolve in any way pr oppose my desire, I shall deem to be mine enemies. If you are subject to me and hold me in reverence, then obey me and take Sita away from here this very day. Formerly she appealed to me saying, \u2018I wish to visit the sacred retreats of the banks of the Ganges\u2019, let her wish be fulfilled!\u201d", "Having spoken thus, the virtuous Kakutstha, his eyes filled with tears, re-entered his apartments escorted by his brothers, his heart riven with grief, sighing like an elephant.", "When the night had passed, Lakshmana, with a sad heart and downcast mien, said to Suxnantra:\u2014", "\u201cO Charioteer, harness swift horses to the most excellent of cars and, by the king\u2019s orders, prepare a comfortable and luxurious seat for Sita, she, in accord with the king\u2019s wish, under my charge, is to visit the retreats of the great Rishis of pious practices, therefore bring hither the chariot with all speed!\u201d", "Then Sumantra saying, \u201cBe it so I\u201d yoked some superb horses to a splendid chariot that was well furnished with cushions and, approaching Saumitri, the heaper of honours on his friends, he said:\u2014", "\u201cThe car is ready, let what must be accomplished be done, O Lord!\u201d", "At these words of Sumantra, Lakshmana re-entered the King\u2019s palace and, having approached Sita, that Bull among Men addressed her thus:\u2014", "\u201cAccording to the wish that you didst express to him, that Lord of Men, the king, has charged me to take you to the desired retreats. At the request of our sovereign, I will conduct you without delay to those excellent solitudes of the Rishis on the banks of the Ganges, O Divine Vaidehi. I shall take you to those hermitages inhabited by the Sages.\u201d", "At these words of the magnanimous Lakshmana, Vaidehi experienced supreme felicity, so greatly did the thought of the expedition please her and, having furnished herself with costly raiment and jewels of every kind, she prepared to depart, saying:\u2014", "\u201cI shall give these jewels as also the excellent robes and various treasures to the wives of the ascetics.\u201d", "\u201cIt is well\u201d, said Saumitri, causing Maithili to ascend the chariot and, recollecting Rama\u2019s command, he went forward drawn by swift horses.", "Thereafter Sita said to Lakshmana, the increaser of prosperity:", "\u201cI behold countless inauspicious omens, O Joy of the House of Raghu, observe how my left eye twitches and all my limbs tremble, further my mind is confused and I feel extremely restless whilst all my courage has ebbed away, 0 Saumitri. The earth appears deserted, O Large-eyed Prince, can your brother be happy, O You who art so devoted to him? May all be well with my mothers-in-law without distinction, O Hero! May all beings in town and country be happy!\u201d", "Thus, with joined palms, Sita, the divine Maithili prayed, and Lakshmana listening, bent his head and, though his heart was contracted with grief, he cried in joyous accents, \u201cMayest you too be happy 1\u201d", "Meantime they reached the banks of the Gaumati and rested in a hermitage, and the following day, at dawn, Saumitri, rising, said to the charioteer:\u2014", "\u201cHarness the car speedily! To-day, with great strength, I shall bear the waters of the Bhagirathi on my head, as did Tryambaka [i.e., The Lord Shiva.].\u201d", "Thus commanded, the driver with joined palms, said to Vaidehi:\u2014", "\u201cMount!\u201d and he gave rein to the horses yoked to the chariot, who were as swift as thought, whereupon she, hearing the voice of the charioteer, ascended that excellent car. Thereafter the large-eyed Sita accompanied by Saumitri and Sumantra reached the Ganges, that destroys all sin and, arriving there at noon, beholding the waters of the Bhagirathi, the unfortunate Lakshmana began to weep openly in his profound distress and the virtuous Sita, in her extreme solicitude, observing Laksh-mana\u2019s misery, enquired of him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWherefore art you groaning? We have reached the banks of the Jahnavi, the object of my desires for a long time and, at the moment of rejoicing, why dost you cause me pain in this wise, O Lakshmana? O Bull among Men, is your grief on account of these two days absence from Rama, you who art ever in attendance on him? Rama is dearer to me than life, O Lakshmana, yet I do not distress myself; do not behave like a child! Let us cross the Ganges and visit the Sages so that I may distribute the raiment and jewels. Having paid homage to the great Rishis, which we owe to them and, passing one day there, we shall return to the city. My heart is impatient to see Rama again, whose eyes are like the petals of a lotus, whose chest is like a lion\u2019s, that foremost of men!\u201d", "At these words of Sita\u2019s, Lakshmana, wiping his beautiful eyes, hailed the ferrymen and they, with joined palms, said \u201cThe boat is ready!\u201d", "Eager to cross over that splendid river, Lakshmana boarded the skiff, and his mind pre-occupied, took Sita across the Ganges.", "The younger brother of Raghava, having first assisted Maithili to board it, entered the well-furnished boat ready to depart, thereafter he said to Sumantra, \u201cWait here with the chariot\u201d and, overcome with grief, he commanded the craft to set sail.", "Arriving at the farther bank of the Bhagirathi, Lakshmana, with joined palms, his face bathed in tears, said:\u2014", "\u201cA stake has been driven into my heart by the noble and virtuous Rama, which will bring universal censure upon me. Death were better for me this day, verily death would be preferable to the mission on which I am engaged, which the world will condemn. Forgive me and do not impute this offence to me, O Illustrious Princess.\u201d", "Thereafter, making obeisance, Lakshmana threw himself on the earth. Seeing him weep, paying her homage and calling on death, Maithili, alarmed, said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cWhat is this? I do not understand anything; tell me the truth, O Lakshmana, why art you agitated? Is the king well? Tell me the cause of your grief!\u201d", "Thus questioned by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, his heart filled with anguish, with bowed head, choked with sobs, addressed her saying:\u2014", "\u201cHaving learnt in open council that he was the object of severe censure in the city and country on thine account, O Daughter of Janaka, Rama, his heart riven, returning home told me of it. I am unable to repeat the things spoken in confidence to me, O Queen. Although you are blameless in mine eyes, the king has repudiated you. Public condemnation has perturbed him; do not misunderstand the matter, O Goddess. I am to leave you in the vicinity of the sacred hermitages. The king has commanded me to do so on the pretext of satisfying your desire. The ascetics\u2019 retreats on the banks of the Jahnavi are sacred and enchanting, do not give way to grief, O Lovely One. The foremost of Rishis, the supremely illustrious Sage Valmiki was a great friend of your sire, King Dasaratha. Taking refuge under the shadow of the feet of that magnanimous One and living in chastity, be happy, O Daughter of Janaka. It is by remaining faithfill to your Lord and practising devotion to Rama in thine heart that you shalt, by your conduct, acquire supreme felicity, O Goddess.\u201d", "Hearing Lakshmana\u2019s harsh words, the daughter of Janaka, overcome with despair, fell to the ground but, regaining consciousness after a time, her eyes bathed in tears, she addressed him in broken accents, saying:\u2014", "\u201cAssuredly this body of mine has been created for misfortune and is its supporter from this time forward. What sin can I have committed in days gone by or whom did I separate from her husband, that I, who am virtuous and chaste, should be cast off by the king?", "\u201cFormerly I lived in the forest following in Rama\u2019s footsteps and was content in the misfortune in which I found myself, O Prince, now, how can I, abandoned by all, live in solitude, O dear Lakshmana? To whom shall I confide the affliction that has overwhelmed me? What can I say to the ascetics, O Lord? For what sin, for what reason, am I repudiated by the magnanimous Raghava? I may not yield up my life in the waters of the Ganges, lest I bring the royal line to an end 1 Therefore do what you have been commanded, O Saumitri, leave me to my wretched plight! It is for you to carry out the king\u2019s behests, yet hear me\u2014do you with joined palms pay homage to all my mothers-in-law and, having worshipped his feet, address the king.", "With bowed head, speak to them all, O Lakshmana, and do you also say to the king, who is ever fixed in his duty,", "\u2018O Raghava, you knowest I am truly pure and that I have been bound to you in supreme love, yet you have renounced me in fear of dishonour, because your subjects have reproached and censured you, O Hero. You should, however have spared me, since you are my only refuge.\u2019", "Further, you should say to the king who is established in righteousness, \u2018As you dost act in regard to your brothers, so should you act in regard to your subjects; this is pre-eminently your duty and will bring you immeasurable renown; by its observance you will enjoy the fruits of the earth 1 As for me, I am not distressed on mine own account, O Prince of Raghu, it is for you to keep your fair name untarnished! The husband is as a God to the woman, he is her family, and her spiritual preceptor, therefore, even at the price of her life, she must seek to please her lord.\u2019", "\u201cRepeat these words to Rama, it is all I ask of you. Having borne witness that I am far advanced in pregnancy, do you depart.\u201d", "So did Sita speak and Lakshmana, sad at heart, bowed to the earth without being able to answer her. Thereafter he circumambulated her sobbing aloud and, after reflecting awhile, said:\u2014", "\u201cWhat hast you said, O Beautiful Princess, I have never raised mine eyes to your face and have ever but looked on your feet, O Irreproachable One. How should I, in his absence, dare to gaze upon the one Rama has abandoned in the lonely forest?\u201d", "With these words, he paid obeisance to her and re-entered the boat. Boarding the skiff, he urged the ferryman on, saying:\u2014", "\u201cCross to the farther shore.\u201d", "Beside himself with grief, in deep affliction, he, having reached the other bank proceeded in his swiftly moving chariot, turning round again and again to gaze on Sita, who, as if bereft of all support, was wandering about distraught on the farther side of the Ganges. Her eyes fixed on the chariot and on Lakshmana, now far distant, Sita was overcome with grief, and, crushed by the weight of her misfortune, the illustrious, noble and virtuous woman, seeing herself without a protector in the forest, that re-echoed to the cry of peacocks, a prey to despair, burst into loud sobs.", "Beholding Sita who was sobbing, the sons of the Rishis ran to seek out the blessed Valmiki of rigid penances and, having paid obeisance to the feet of that great ascetic, the children of the Sages informed him that a woman was weeping nearby, saying", "\u201cO Lord, a lady resembling Shri, whom we have never before seen and who must be the consort of some great man, her features distorted, is lamenting in the vicinity of the hermitage! O Blessed One, you will surely deem her to be a goddess fallen from heaven! Verily the most lovely of women, in deep distress, appeared before us on the bank of a river, shedding scalding tears, overcome by grief. In this misfortune that was assuredly not merited, she is alone and without a protector. We do not know the lady but do you receive her with kindness for she is close to this retreat and has come to take refuge with you.\u201d", "Valmiki, that Prince of Sages, being aware of everything by virtue of his asceticism, ascertaining the truth of their words, with rapid steps went to where the Queen was weeping, and, as he strode forward, the disciples followed that illustrious Muni.", "Bearing the Arghya in his hands, proceeding on foot, the sagacious Valmiki reached the banks of the river and beheld Raghava\u2019s beloved consort lamenting like one bereft. Thereafter, having consoled her by virtue of his holiness, the great ascetic addressed her in a sweet voice, saying", "\u201cO Virtuous Lady, you are the daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha, Rama\u2019s beloved consort, the daughter of Janaka! O Faithful One, by virtue of my meditations, the cause that brings you here has been revealed to me. O Auspicious One, I am fully aware of your purity, for all that comes to pass in the Three Worlds is known to me. By my spiritual vision, I am convinced of your chaste conduct, O Daughter of Janaka; you are under my protection, O Vaidehi, take comfort 1 Not far from mine hermitage there are many female ascetics established in pious practices, they will care for you as for their own daughter, 0 Dear Child. Now accept the Arghya and trust in me, giving up all anxiety. Do not grieve but look on this as thine abode.\u201d", "Hearing these excellent words from the Sage, Sita, paying obeisance to his feet, with joined palms, accompanied the ascetic.", "Beholding the Sage approaching, followed by Vaidehi, the female ascetics came out to meet them and, filled with delight, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Foremost among the Sages, be you welcome; it is long since you have visited us, we bow down to you, what are your commands?\u201d", "Hearing their words, Valmiki answered:\u2014", "\u201cThis lady is Sita, the consort of the virtuous Rama, she is the daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha, the chaste daughter of Janaka.

It is evident to me that fate has separated Raghava from Vaidehi 1 O Charioteer, destiny is inexorable! Raghava, who, in his wrath, slew the Gods, Gandharvas, Asuras and Rakshasas, is under the sway of destiny. Formerly Rama, at his father\u2019s command, dwelt in the vast and lonely Dandaka Forest for fourteen years, but more painful and cruel to me seems the repudiation of Sita through listening to the calumny of the people.

Passion runs wild on all sides like exceedingly wicked steeds. Satiated with all the objects of enjoyment, it is better to govern these appetites with patience. By mind, speech and sight, a man should engage himself in the well-being of others. He should give up aversion and injure no one. The harm that an uncontrolled mind can accomplish is beyond the range of a sharp sword or a serpent that has been trodden underfoot or a foe who has been provoked.

O Lord, by anger, punishment and reward, you dost remove the sins and dangers of your subjects; it is thine to give and withdraw, you are the dispenser, destroyer and protector and art as Indra to us. In energy you are as fire, irresistible to all creatures and, since you dost spread your lustre on all beings, you are like the sun! You resemblest the Lord of Wealth and art even superior to him, for prosperity resides in you. You lookest on all creatures whether animate or inanimate with the same eye, 0 Raghava, and dost regard foe and friend alike, duly protecting your subjects. O Raghava, those who have incurred thine anger are already slain, therefore you are praised as Yama. O Foremost of Kings, since, in human form, you are merciful and beneficent, people sing your glory, you who art intent on not harming men. The king is the strength of the weak and helpless, the eye of the blind and the refuge of those who seek shelter in him. You are also our Lord, therefore hear our plea! O King, entering into my nest, this vulture is oppressing me; you alone, O Foremost of Men, art the divine chastiser of creatures 1\u201d", "Hearing these words, Rama called for his ministers with those of King Dasaratha, Vrishti, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Rashtravarddhana, Ashoka, Dharmapala and the highly powerful Sumantra and others, who were well versed in the law, high-minded and conversant with the Shastras, intelligent, nobly born and skilled in counsel.", "Thereafter summoning both, Rama, descending from his throne, enquired of the vulture:\u2014\u201cHow long has this nest been made?

That religion is no religion where truth is not to be found and that truth is no truth where there is guile. Those counsellors are liars, who remain silent when they are well informed in any matter. He who does not speak either on account of passion, fear or anger, binds himself with a thousand nooses of Varuna and, at the expiration of a full year, is only released from a single sin.\u201d", "Hearing these words, the ministers said to Rama:\u2014", "\u201cO You of great intellect, what the owl has said is true, the vulture has spoken falsely.

Having destroyed the creation and entered the waters, the highly effulgent Vishnu, identical with the souls of creatures, lay asleep there for many long years. Beholding Vishnu asleep after the destruction of the worlds and, knowing all the entries to be obstructed, the great Brahma entered his belly. Thereupon a golden lotus sprang from Vishnu\u2019s navel, and that great Lord, the Creator, Brahma, rose therefrom and engaged in severe penances for the purpose of creating the earth, air, mountains, trees, men, reptiles and all other life-forms from the womb or egg.", "\u201cThereafter, from the wax in the ears of Narayana, two valiant and dreadful Daityas, Madhu and Kaitabha were born.

Then, purifying it once more, Vishnu, the Preserver of the World covered it with trees and created medicinal herbs. Thus filled with the marrow of Madhu and Kaitabha, the earth was called Medini. It is for this that I hold this abode does not belong to the vulture but to the owl, O Counsellors, the owl having maintained that he built the nest when trees were first created, that is, before men appeared. This vicious vulture should therefore be punished, for this evil-minded one, having robbed another of its nest, is now oppressing him.\u201d", "At that moment a voice was heard in the sky, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, do not slay the vulture for it has already been reduced to ashes by the power of Gautama\u2019s asceticism.

Thereafter those magnanimous Sages, entering the palace, with their loshtas filled with holy water drawn from sacred places, carried various kinds of fruit and roots as an offering to the king, which Rama accepted with delight.", "Then that long-armed prince said to those illustrious Sages:\u2014\u201cDo you occupy these seats according to your pleasure.\u201d Thus invited by Rama, those great Rishis took their places on the brilliant golden seats and, seeing them installed, Rama, with joined palms, paying obeisance to them, enquired of them saying:\u2014", "\u201cFor what reason have you come? In my devotion I would feign know what I may do for you? I am at your command O Illustrious Ones, and shall carry out all you desire with great delight.

It behoves you to deliver the Sages from a great peril, O Lord.\u201d", "Then Kakutstha enquired of those ascetics, who had spoken thus, saying:\u2014", "\u201cSay what shall I do, O Munis, in order to dispel this danger for you?\u201d", "At these words from Kakutstha, Bhargava replied:\u2014", "\u201cLearn the cause of our fears and from whence they spring, O Prince! Formerly in the Krita-yuga, a highly intelligent Daitya, the great Asura Madhu, the eldest son of Lola, who was well-disposed to the brahmins and protected all those who sought refuge in him, was united in an unequalled friendship to the supremely illustrious Gods. And Madhu, who was endowed with valour and ever fixed in his duty, received a marvellous weapon from Rudra, who held him in high esteem.", "Taking from his own trident, another of great power and beauty, that magnanimous One, well pleased, conferred it upon him and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018You have fulfilled your duty in a remarkable degree, which has evoked my grace! In the supreme delight that I now experience, I confer this excellent weapon upon you. As long as you dost not attack the Gods or the brahmins, O Great Asura, this spear will remain with you, otherwise it will vanish. Whoever rashly provokes you to combat will be reduced to ashes by this weapon which, thereafter, will return to thine hand!\u2019", "\u201cHaving received this rare gift from Rudra, the great Asura prostrated himself before Mahadeva and said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018O Lord, You who art the Chief of the Gods, O Blessed One, may this weapon ever remain in my family.\u2019", "\u201cThus spoke Madhu, and the Lord of all beings, Shiva, that great God, anwered him saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Nay, that may not be, nevertheless since your plea finds favour with me, it shall not have been uttered in vain; your son shall inherit this weapon. As long as it is in his hand, he will be invulnerable to all beings, but only if it remains there.\u2019", "\u201cThen Madhu, the foremost of the Asuras, having received that great and marvellous gift from the God, built himself a magnificent abode. He had a beloved wife, the fortunate and illustrious Kumbhinasi, who was born of Vishvasu by Anala, and she bore him a son full of vigour named Lavana. Cruel and perverse from infancy, he was ever engaged in harming others and, seeing the iniquitous conduct of his son, Madhu was incensed and grieved but he said nothing. After a time he left this world and entered Varuna\u2019s abode, having bequeathed the weapon to Lavana and instructed him in the nature of the gift.", "\u201cNow Lavana, due to the power of that weapon and his natural perversity, has become the scourge of the Three Worlds and particularly of the Sages, his might being equalled by the power of that weapon. You have heard all, now it is for you to decide, O Kakutstha, for you are our supreme refuge.", "\u201cMany monarchs, O Rama, have been solicited by the Sages to deliver them from fear, but, O Valiant Prince, we have not found a protector. Learning that you had destroyed Ravana with his infantry and cavalry, we have recognized you as our saviour, O Dear Son. We know of no other king on earth capable of delivering us; we entreat you to free us from the terror which Lavana inspires in us. This, O Rama, is the cause of our present fear; you are able to dispel it; fulfil our desire, O You whose valour is unconquerable.\u201d", "Such was the speech of the ascetics, and Rama, with joined palms, enquired of them, saying:\u2014", "\u201cOn what does he live?

On whom shall the choice fall, on the valiant Bharata or the sagacious Shatrughna?\u201d", "Listening to Raghava\u2019s words, Bharata answered:\u2014\u201cIt is I who will slay him 1 Let the task be entrusted to me!\u201d", "Hearing Bharata, full of energy and courage, speak thus, Shatrughna, the younger brother of Lakshmana, rose from his golden seat and, bowing before that Lord of Men, said:\u2014", "\u201cThe long-armed Bharata has already proved his fortitude; let him remain amongst us, O Joy of the Raghus.

Undergoing innumerable hardships, O Prince, lying on a hard couch in Nandigrama, the supremely illustrious Bharata lived on fruit and roots, his hair matted and clothed in bark. Having endured such a test, that son of Raghu should not have to undergo further trials since I, your servant, am here.\u201d", "Thus spoke Shatrughna and Raghava said:\u2014", "\u201cBe it so, O Descendant of Kakutstha, carry out my commands and I will install you as king in the splendid capital of Madhu. O Long-armed Warrior, let Bharata stay here as you wishest; you are brave and experienced and well able to establish a kingdom with its flourishing provinces and a capital that is washed by the Yamuna, for he who, having destroyed a dynasty, does not install a king, goes to hell. As for you, when you have slain the son of Madhu, Lavana of perverse ways, do you govern his kingdom righteously if you desirest to carry out my wishes. Do not question what I have said, O Hero, the younger brother should undoubtedly obey the elder. O Descendant of Kakutstha, receive the consecration at my hands with the traditional blessings pronounced by Vasishtha and the other brahmins.\u201d", "These words of Rama filled the valiant Shatrughna with confusion and he spoke with exceeding diffidence, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Lord of Men, these measures do not seem to me to be justified! How may a younger brother be installed when his elders yet live? Still it is imperative that I should submit to your will, O Fortunate Prince, for it would be impossible for me to disregard any order of thine. I have heard from your lips, O Hero, and the scriptures have taught me that one should never oppose the one in authority once he has spoken. My words were ill-advised when I said \u2018I will slay the redoubtable Lavana in the open field.\u2019 This unfortunate utterance places me in a serious dilemma, O Foremost of Men. One should not add anything when one\u2019s elders have spoken, for this is a moral taint and, in the next world, proves a cause of retribution. I shall not speak again, O Lord Kakutstha, for fear that a second observation draw punishment upon me. I shall do your pleasure, O Foremost of Men, O Joy of Raghu, but do you so order it that in mine interest this improper act be erased.\u201d", "Thus spoke the brave and high-souled Shatrughna and Rama, greatly delighted, said to Bharata and Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cPrepare everything for the installation with care.

O Foremost of Men, ere he returns to the city and while he is without his weapon, place thyself at the entry furnished with your powerful shaft. Before he regains his abode, challenge that demon to combat, O Long-armed Warrior, and you shalt overcome him. If you actest in any other way, you canst not slay him; whereas using these means, O Valiant One, you will exterminate him. You knowest all and how to eschew that weapon of irresistible force belonging to the ancient Shitikanta [i.e., The Lord Shiva].\u201d", "Having spoken thus to Shatrughna, the offspring of Kakutstha, and encouraged him again and again, Rama, the Joy of the House of Raghu continued:\u2014", "\u201cHere are four thousand horses, two thousand chariots, a hundred selected elephants and stalls furnished with every provision, also singers and dancers.

When the whole earth is under your dominion, then, with your servants, thine army and your chariots, do you take possession of the kingdom of the Gods.\u2019", "\u201cThus did Indra speak, and Mandhata answered him, saying:", "\u201c\u2018Who on the face of the earth has contested my domination?\u2019 Then the God of a Thousand Eyes said:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018The Rakshasa named Lavana, son of Madhu, who dwells in the forest, has not recognized thine authority, O Irreproachable Warrior!\u2019", "\u201cAt these extremely unpleasing words uttered by Indra, the king hung his head in shame, being unable to answer him. Thereafter, paying obeisance to the Thousand-eyed God, he departed with bowed head and returned to earth.", "\u201cThen that Prince, the Slayer of His Foes, concealing his anger, placed himself at the head of his servants, infantry and cavalry and marched against the son of Madhu in order to conquer him. And that foremost of men sent a messenger to Lavana to challenge him to combat, who, coming before him, covered the son of Madhu with abuses and, while he was still speaking, the Rakshasa devoured him.", "\u201cAs his envoy failed to return, the king, enraged, assailed Lavana with a hail of arrows, whereupon the Rakshasa, taking up his trident, mockingly hurled it upon him in order to exterminate him and his followers, and the flaming trident, that formidable weapon, reduced the king, his servants, his infantry and cavalry to ashes and returned to the hand of its master.", "\u201cThus did that great monarch perish with his footsoldiers and chariots. O My Friend, it was through the power of that trident, which is unsurpassed! To-morrow at dawn you shalt without doubt slay Lavana ere he has taken up his weapon; your victory is assured! The worlds will be freed as a result of thine exploit. O Foremost of Men, I have now told you all concerning the wicked Lavana; it is on this account that Mandhata succumbed in his undertaking. To-morrow at dawn, O Magnanimous One, you shalt undoubtedly slay him! He will have set out in search of food without his trident. Your victory is therefore assured, O Foremost of Men.\u201d", "Whilst Cyavana was recounting this story and all were wishing him an overwhelming victory, the night speedily passed away for the magnanimous Shatrughna.", "Meantime as the cloudless dawn broke, the bold Rakshasa set out from the city eager to find food and, during this time the intrepid Shatrughna crossed the Yamuna and, bow in hand, took up his position at the gate of Madhupura.", "At noon, that Rakshasa of evil karma returned laden with countless living beings and, beholding Shatrughna standing at the gate with his weapon, the demon enquired of him:\u2014", "\u201cWhat will you do with that weapon? In my wrath, O Least of Warriors, I have devoured thousands of men like you with their weapons; it is death that brings you here. I am not yet fully fed, O Vilest of Men, why hast you come to cast thyself into my mouth, you fool!\u201d", "Thus did he speak, laughing loudly, and the courageous Shatrughna shed tears of rage and, in his fury, sparks of fire issued from all his limbs. Thereafter, in a transport of anger, he said to that ranger of the night:\u2014", "\u201cI shall enter into single combat with you! I am the son of Dasaratha, the brother of the sagacious Rama, my name is Shatrughna, a veritable Shatrughna, and it is my desire to slay you that has brought me hither! I wish to fight with you, therefore be on your guard! You are the enemy of all beings; you shalt not escape me alive!\u201d", "At these words die Rakshasa, sneering, answered the prince, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt is my good fortune that has brought you to me, O Insensate One. Rama slew my maternal aunt\u2019s brother, Ravana, on account of a woman, O Wretch. O Lord of Men, I have suffered the entire destruction of Ravana\u2019s family and it is because I have neglected to avenge them that you are overconfident. I shall exterminate you all, O Vilest of Men, I shall sweep you all away like straws, both those who are already born and those still to be born. O You of vicious intellect, I accept your challenge! Stay but a moment till I fetch my weapon, one suited to your destruction!\u201d", "Thereupon Shatrughna instantly answered saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat, shalt you escape me alive? He who has any wit does not allow a foe to go free who has come forth of his own accord. He, who, in his stupidity, suffers a foe to escape, perishes. Look long on the world, for, with my whetted shafts, I shall despatch you to Yama\u2019s abode, you the enemy of the Three Worlds and of Raghava.\u201d", "At these words from the mighty Shatrughna, Lavana fell into a violent rage and cried out:\u2014\u201cStay\u201d, striking his hands together and grinding his teeth, thereafter assailing that Lion of the Raghus with redoubled blows.", "Thereupon Shatrughna, the Slayer of His Foes, answered Lavana of formidable aspect, who had addressed him thus, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhen others were slain by you, I was not yet born, but to-day, pierced by my darts, do you enter the region of Yama! May the Rishis and learned brahmins this day be witness of your death in combat, O Wretch! When my shafts have consumed you in the fight, you who art a ranger of the night, the city and the country too will be at peace. As the rays of the sun penetrate the lotus, so shall the dreadful pointed arrows, loosed by mine arm, pierce your heart.\u201d", "Then Lavana, beside himself with anger on hearing these words, hurled a great tree on Shatrughna striking his breast, but he severed it into a hundred pieces, and the Rakshasa, finding himself foiled, seized hold of a large number of trees and hurled them on his adversary; then Shatrughna, burning with ardour, severed those innumerable trees, one by one, with three or four well-seasoned crescent-shaped arrows and, thereafter, he let a shower of darts fall on the valiant Rakshasa without causing him to retreat. With a mocking laugh, Lavana, brandishing a tree, struck the head of that hero so that he fell insensible, and when that warrior fell, a great cry of \u201cAh! Ah!\u201d arose from the Rishis, Devas, Gandharvas and also Apsaras.", "Thereupon the Rakshasa, thinking Shatrughna to be slain, did not enter his house, though the opportunity presented itself and, seeing him lying on the earth, he did not go in search of his trident, but, reflecting, \u201cHe is dead,\u201d he began to collect his food.", "Shatrughna, however, regaining his senses, in an instant took hold of his weapon and went to his place at the city gate once more, amidst the acclamations of the Rishis; and he selected a celestial, infallible and marvellous arrow that illumined the ten regions with its brilliance and resembled lightning in its velocity. That shaft, smeared with sandalpaste of the colour of blood, wonderfully plumed, was greatly feared by the leaders of the Danavas, the mountains and also the Asuras, and, beholding that dreadful weapon, flaming like Time at the end of the world period, all beings were seized with terror. Then Devas, Asuras, Gandharvas and troops of Apsaras and the whole universe trembled and took refuge with the Grandsire of the worlds. Thereafter the Gods, beside themselves with fear, enquired of that Lord of Lords, the Bestower of Grace, the Grandsire of the Worlds, whether the universe were about to be destroyed. Hearing them speak thus, Brahma, the Grandsire, addressed them in soothing accents, that restored their serenity, saying:\u2014", "\u201cHear me, O You Gods, it is in order to destroy Lavana in combat that Shatrughna is armed with that weapon. O Foremost of the Gods, all are overwhelmed by the power of this eternal weapon forged by the primeval God, the Creator of the World. O My Children, that effulgent shaft which causes such terror was fashioned for the destruction of the demons, Madhu and Kaitabha, by the magnanimous God, Vishnu, who alone understands it. In reality, it is the primeval form of Vishnu Himself, therefore go and witness the death of the foremost of the Rakshasas, Lavana, under the blows of that valiant warrior, the younger brother of Rama.\u201d", "At these words of that God of Gods, the Devas went to the place where the combat between Shatrughna and Lavana was in progress and that weapon of celestial effulgence, which Shatrughna held in his hand, appeared to all beings like the Fire that blazes forth at the dissolution of the worlds!", "Beholding the firmament filled with the Celestial Host, the descendant of Raghu emitted a leonine roar and, thereafter, looked on Lavana again and again. On this renewed provocation from his adversary, the Rakshasa, enraged, stretched his bow up to his ear and that most skilled of archers discharged his great arrow on the breast of the enemy, that piercing it, entered the lower regions. Having penetrated into Rasatala itself, the celestial weapon, honoured by the Gods, immediately returned to that hero, the Joy of the Ikshvakus, and, pierced by Shat-rughna\u2019s arrow, Lavana, that ranger of the night, fell like a mountain struck by lightning.", "Thereafter, Lavana being slain under the eyes of the Gods, the mighty celestial trident returned to Rudra. When, with a single shaft, that hero of the Raghus destroyed the terror of the Three Worlds with his bow and marvellous arrow, he resembled that orb of a thousand rays which dispels the darkness.", "Then the Devas, great Rishis, Pannagas and Apsaras cried out in chorus:\u2014", "\u201cBy good fortune, the son of Dasaratha has triumphed; fear is banished and, like a great reptile, Lavana lies stretched on the earth.\u201d", "Lavana being slain, the Gods with their leaders, led by Agni, spoke to Shatrughna in affectionate terms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cBy good fortune, O Dear Child, you are victorious; by good fortune, Lavana the Rakshasa is destroyed! O Lion among Men, O Pious One, do you ask for a boon. The distributors of boons, those who desired your triumph, are assembled here, O Long-armed Warrior, let not our presence prove fruitless 1\u201d", "Hearing these words of the Gods, that long-armed warrior, Shatrughna, placing his joined palms to his forehead, answered humbly:\u2014", "\u201cThat I may enter into possession of this ravishing and picturesque city, constructed by the Gods, is my dearest wish!\u201d", "Then the Celestials answered with delight, \u201cBe it so! this charming city shall assuredly become Shurashena!\u201d", "At these words the high-souled Celestials returned to their abode; the valiant Shatrughna, however, summoned his army that was encamped on the banks of the Yamuna and the troops immediately came to that place, having learned of his victory, and he established himself there in the month of Shravana.", "The inhabitants of that region of celestial aspect lived there for twelve years in peace and happiness, and the fields abounded in grain. Under the aegis of Shatrughna\u2019s arms, Indra sent rain in the proper season and the city was full of healthy and happy people. That capital had the brilliance of the crescent moon and rose in splendour on the banks of the Yamuna; and it was magnificent with its buildings and squares, markets and highways and the inhabitants who belonged to the four castes.", "Shatrughna had embellished the magnificent and vast edifices that Lavana had formerly constructed and painted in various colours. Parks and places of entertainment were to be found in all parts of that city, which was also adorned with works of art both human and divine. Of a celestial aspect, it was filled with different kinds of merchandise, and traders from every country came there. Looking on that opulent city, Shatrughna, the younger brother of Bharata, at the height of prosperity and happiness, experienced supreme satisfaction.", "After twelve years while he yet dwelt in that enchanting abode, the thought came to him, \u201cI desire to behold Rama again,\u201d thereupon, while residing in that city full of people of every condition, the prince resolved to look on the feet of the Chief of the Raghus once more.", "Now in the twelfth year, Shatrughna, with a small escort of servants and soldiers, desired to return to Ayodhya where Rama reigned. Having dissuaded his leading counsellors and chief warriors from accompanying him, he set out on his most excellent steed with a hundred chariots.", "That descendant of Raghu, having covered fifteen stages (of the journey) reached Valmiki\u2019s hermitage where he halted. Thereafter that foremost of men paid obeisance to the ascetic, who, as host, with his own hands offered him water to wash his feet and the Arghya. Then the Sage recounted the most agreeable and varied traditions to the magnanimous Shatrughna and, speaking of the death of Lavana, he said:\u2014", "\u201cYou have accomplished a difficult feat in slaying him! O Valiant Youth, many mighty monarchs with their troops of infantry and cavalry succumbed in their struggle with Lavana. You have slain him as it were in sport, O Foremost of Men! By your valour, the fear of the worlds has been terminated. The death of Ravana was brought about with great difficulty by Rama, but this marvellous feat of arms has been accomplished by you without any trouble whatsoever! At the fall of Lavana, great joy broke out amongst the Celestials and happiness now reigns amidst all beings in the whole world, O Prince of the House of Raghu! Being present in Vasava\u2019s assembly, I witnessed your combat, and my heart too was filled with a keen felicity; now by smelling the crown of your head, I testify to the great affection I bear for you.\u201d", "With these words, the illustrious Valmiki smelt the crown of Shatrughna\u2019s head and offered him and his followers the traditional hospitality.", "Having eaten, Shatrughna, the foremost of men, listened to the sweetest chants which told the history of Rama and how all had taken place. Stringed instruments accompanied the singing in the triple mode [i.e., That is sung from the heart, throat and head] which was expressive and melodic; and he heard the story of Rama and what had formerly been achieved by him; his imperishable exploits as they had taken place in time gone by, and that foremost of men, Shatrughna, was transported, his eyes full of tears, and he remained absorbed, sighing again and again. It seemed to him that this song made the past live once more, and Shatrughna\u2019s companions, overcome, listened to the enchanting symphonic poem with bowed heads.", "Thereafter, those warriors cried out, \u201cWonderful!\u201d and began to question each other, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat is this? Where are we? Is it a vision or a dream? Are we seeing that marvellous epic in a dream?\u201d In their extreme astonishment, they said to Shatrughna:\u2014", "\u201cO Prince, do you interrogate Valmiki, that foremost of Sages,\u201d for they were all struck with amazement, but Shatrughna answered them, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO You Soldiers, it is not fitting to interrogate such a person. Many miracles take place in this hermitage, nevertheless, it does not become us to question a great ascetic out of curiosity.\u201d", "Having spoken thus to his troops, the son of Raghu paid obeisance to that illustrious Rishi and entered his own quarters.", "Though that lion among men had laid himself down, he was unable to sleep and his mind was absorbed in the marvellous epic of Rama, and while he listened to those ravishing strains accompanied by stringed instruments, the night passed quickly for the magnanimous Shatrughna. The night being over, that prince, having performed his morning devotions, with joined palms addressed the foremost of ascetics, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Blessed One, I desire to behold the one who is the Joy of the Raghu Race and crave permission to take leave of you and the other acetics of rigid penances.\u201d", "Hearing the petition of Shatrughna, the Scourge of his Foes, offspring of the Raghu Race, Valmiki embraced him and granted him permission to depart. Thereupon that prince, having paid obeisance to the foremost of the ascetics, ascended a magnificent chariot and, in his eagerness to see Rama, soon reached Ayodhya.", "Having entered that charming city, the long-armed and fortunate descendant of the Ikshvakus sought out Rama of great renown and beheld him seated amidst his counsellors, his countenance as radiant as the full moon, and he resembled the Thousand-eyed God surrounded by the Immortals.", "Paying obeisance to the resplendent and magnanimous Rama with joined palms, he addressed that hero, whose prowess was truth, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Great King, all that you have commanded has been carried out by me; the wicked Lavana is dead and his city is occupied. Now twelve years have been passed far from you, O Joy of the Raghus, and I can no longer live separated from you, O Prince. Be gracious to me, O Kakutstha, you whose valour is immeasurable; do not ask me to remain there longer like a calf separated from its mother.\u201d", "As he spoke thus, Kakutstha embraced him and said:\u2014", "\u201cDo not give way to despondency, O Valiant One, such conduct is not worthy of a warrior. Kings do not withdraw to foreign lands, O Raghava, the duty of a king is the protection of his people. O Virtuous Shatrughna, do you visit me from time to time in Ayodhya, then you must return to your capital. I too cherish you more than life itself yet it is essential to look to the security of your kingdom. Meantime remain here with me for seven days, O Kakutstha, and thereafter return to Madhura with thine escort of servants and cavalry.\u201d", "Hearing Rama\u2019s words that were pleasing to the heart and in conformity with dharma, Shatrughna answered sorrowfully, \u201cSo be it!\u201d", "Thereafter, having passed a week in Rama\u2019s proximity, that skilful archer, Shatrughna, in accord with his brother\u2019s will, made preparations to depart. Paying obeisance to that true hero, the magnanimous Rama, and to Bharata and Lakshmana, he ascended his chariot and, being accompanied for a great distance by Lakshmana and Bharata, he hastened to regain his capital.", "Having said farewell to Shatrughna, the fortunate Rama found satisfaction in ruling his kingdom in equity.", "Now some time after, an aged peasant, a brahmin, bearing his dead child in his arms came to the palace gate, weeping and crying out again and again:\u2014", "\u201cWhat sin did I commit in a previous existence?\u201d", "Overcome with paternal grief, he repeated unceasingly, \u201cO My Son, My Son! Ah! Of what fault was I formerly guilty in another body that I should see mine only son meet with death? This boy had not yet reached adolescence, his fourteenth year not having been completed! To my misfortune, before his time, this dear child has been struck down by death 1 In a few days, I and your mother too will die of grief, O Dear Child! I do not recollect ever to have uttered a lie; I do not remember ever inflicting an injury on any animal or doing harm to any person! For what misdeed has this child, born to me, gone to the abode of Vaivasvata this day, ere he had performed a son\u2019s duties to his sire? Never before have I witnessed or heard of such a dreadful thing as, in Rama\u2019s reign, for people to die prematurely. Rama must have committed a serious fault since in his kingdom, children succumb. Assuredly the young who inhabit other countries need not fear death! O King, give me back the life of my child, who has fallen under the sway of death! With my wife, I shall yield up my life at the gate of the king as if I were without a protector 1 Thereafter, having been guilty of Brahmanicide, O Rama, be happy! Mayest you live long with your brothers! O Mighty Monarch, under your rule, after a period of prosperity in thine empire, misfortune has now overtaken us, placing us under death\u2019s dominion, O Rama! From now on we shall not enjoy the least felicity since the empire of the magnanimous Ikshvakus no longer has a support. With Rama as its protector, the death of children is certain. People perish under the unrighteous rule of an impious monarch. The evil conduct of a king brings about the premature death of his subjects. When, in the cities and country, crimes are committed and no supervision is exercised, then death is to be feared! Undoubtedly the king will be held to be at fault in city and country, hence the death of this child.\u201d", "Such were the countless recriminations that the unfortunate father addressed to the king whilst he clasped his son to his breast.", "The piteous lamentations of that unfortunate brahmin reached the ears of the king and he, in the profound distress he experienced, called together his ministers, Vasishtha and Vamadeva, with his brothers and the elders of the city also.", "Then eight brahmins were ushered into the king\u2019s presence by Vasishtha, who resembled a God, and they said:\u2014", "\u201cMay prosperity attend you!\u201d", "Thereafter those foremost of the Twice-born, Markandeya, Maudgalya, Vamadeva, Kashyapa, Katyayana, Javali, Gautama and Narada took their seats, and those Rishis being assembled, Rama paid obeisance to them with joined palms. Then the ministers and citizens received a cordial welcome, as was fitting, and all those highly effulgent persons being seated near him, Raghava informed them of the reproaches of that Twice-born One.", "Hearing the words of the prince, who was filled with distress, Narada himself made this memorable reply in the assembly of the Sages:\u2014", "\u201cLearn, O King, what has caused the untimely death of this child 1 When you are conversant therewith, do what you considerest to be your duty!", "\u201cO Prince, Joy of the Raghus, formerly in the Krita Yuga, the brahmins alone practised asceticism; he who was not a brahmin in no wise undertook it. At the close of that age, all was consumed and absorbed into Brahman. Thereafter the brahmins were re-born enlightened and endowed with the gift of immortality. In that age, none died prematurely and all were wise.", "\u201cThe Treta Yuga followed when the sons of Manu were born [i.e., The Kshatriyas or Warrior Class], who practised austerities; these noble men were the rulers, and full of power and heroism. In that era, Brahmins and Kshatriyas were equal in power nor could any distinction be found amongst them; it was then that the four castes were established.", "\u201cWhen that Yuga, which had been free from nescience, was consumed in the Fire, unrighteousness placed one foot on the earth and, on account of wrong-doing, glory waned and the span of life was diminished, O Best of Monarchs. Flesh that had been formerly eaten, became impure food throughout the whole world and, in these conditions, men gave themselves up to good deeds, taking refuge in purity and justice to rid themselves of evil.", "\u201cIn the Treta Yuga, brahmins and warriors practised asceticism and the rest were under the supreme obligation of obedience, proper to the Vaishya and Shudra classes; the Shudras\u2019 duty being to serve the other three.", "\u201cO Great King, in the Dvapara Yuga, untruth and evil increased, unrightousness having placed a second foot on the earth, and then the Vaishyas began to practice penance, so that dharma, in the form of asceticism, was performed by the three castes, but the Shudras were not permitted to undertake it during that time, O Foremost of Men.", "\u201cO Prince, a man of the lowest caste may not give himself up to penance in the Dvapara Yuga; it is only in the Kali Yuga that the practice of asceticism is permitted to the Shudra caste. During the Dvapara Yuga it is a great crime for one of Shudra birth to perform such practices.", "\u201cAt this time, in thine empire, a rigid penance is being undertaken by a wretched Shudra, 0 Prince, and this is the cause of the death of that child.", "\u201cThe practice of unrighteousness, be it in the city or the country, brings about misfortune and the monarch who does not mete out an immediate punishment, goes to hell, of this there is no doubt.", "\u201cAn act of mortification that is prescribed is well done and a sixth of the merit goes to the king who rules with justice. But how should he, who does not protect his people, enjoy the sixth portion? O Lion among Men, you should investigate the happenings in your kingdom and put down evil wherever it is practised, so righteousness may flourish, man\u2019s life be prolonged and the child be revived.\u201d", "Hearing the nectar-like words of Narada, Rama was delighted and said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cO Dear Friend, you who art faithful to your vows, go and console that leading brahmin and cause the body of the child to be placed in a jar of oil with precious unguents and fragrant salves so that it is covered and does not suffer decomposition. Act in such a way that the body of the child does not dissolve or decay.\u201d", "Having issued this command to Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious marks, the highly illustrious Kakutstha thought of Pushpaka, and said \u201cCome hither!\u201d Conscious of his intention, the golden chariot [i.e., The golden chariot that is the presiding Deity of Pushpaka] appeared before him in the same hour and bowing, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cBehold, I am here at your service, O Long-armed Prince!\u201d", "Listening to the gracious words of Pushpaka, Rama paid obeisance to the great Rishis and ascended the chariot. Armed with his bow, his two quivers and his glittering sword, Raghava left the city in the charge of his two brothers, Saumitri and Bharata, and thereafter that monarch directed his course to the western region which he explored on every side; then he went to the northern region bounded by the Himalayas, but found no trace of evil-doing there; later the eastern region was carefully searched by him and that long-armed Prince, from on high in his chariot, beheld people of pure morals there, as stainless as a mirror. Then he, who causes felicity to the great Rishis, ranged the southern region and, on the side of the Shaivala Mountain, a vast lake appeared to him, on the banks of which the blessed Raghava beheld an ascetic practising an extremely rigorous penance, his head hanging downwards.", "On this that Prince born of Raghu approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said:\u2014", "\u201cBlessed art you, O Ascetic, who art faithful to your vows! From what caste art you sprung, O You who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I, Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast you in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost you seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what you desirest in performing these austerities, O Ascetic. May prosperity attend you! Art you a brahmin? Art you an invincible Kshatriya? Art you a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art you a Shudra? Answer me truthfully!\u201d", "Then the ascetic, who was hanging head downwards, thus questioned by Rama, revealed his origin to that Prince born of Dasaratha, the foremost of kings, and the reason why he was. practising penance.", "Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body.

By virtue of the portion of Indra\u2019s energy, the King Kshupa brought the earth under his control; by the portion of Varuna\u2019s energy, he fostered health in his body; by the power of Yama, he ruled the people.

It was covered with lotuses and waterlilies, no weed or moss grew there and its waters were deep, tranquil and sweet. Near that wonderful lake, I found a spacious hermitage which was of great antiquity and devoid of man or beast. It was there I spent a summer night, O Foremost of Men. At dawn, I rose to perform my morning devotions and directed my steps to the lake. There I beheld a dead body, plump and spotless, shining in splendour in the water. This sight caused me to reflect awhile, O Raghava, and I stood on the banks of the lake asking myself, \u2018What can this be?\u2019", "\u201cO Lord, a moment later a wonderful celestial chariot came into view, which was magnificent, and harnessed to swans that were as swift as thought. In that chariot I beheld a man of extraordinary beauty, O Joy of the House of Raghu, who was surrounded by thousands of Apsaras adorned with celestial ornaments. Some were singing enchantingly whilst others played on musical instruments such as Mridangas, Vinas and Panavas; some were dancing and some, with the aid of Chan-waras gleaming like the moon\u2019s rays, possessing ornate handles, were fanning the face of that lotus-eyed youth. Then he, who was as radiant as the peak of Mount Meru, leaving his seat, descended from the chariot and, under my gaze, devoured that corpse. Having satisfied his hunger with abundant flesh, he plunged into the waters and after washing his hands and rinsing his mouth according to tradition, he re-ascended his chariot.", "\u201cBeholding that heavenly being about to depart, I spoke to him thus, O Prince:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Who art you who resemblest a God?

Without making any gifts, you didst practise asceticism; it is on this account that you are subject to hunger and thirst in heaven, which you have attained. Therefore, thine own body that has been well nourished shall be your food in heaven, and it shall be converted into Amrita, but when the great and invincible Rishi Agastya comes to the forest, he will deliver you from this bondage, O Shveta!

Do you deliver me from this painful pass; release will not come to me from any other than the Ascetic Kumb-hayoni! O Dear and Excellent Sage, do you accept this gift, may good betide you, accord me this favour!

This is why that Celestial Being, who resembled Shakra, gave that divine gem, wonderful to look upon, to me, O Kakutstha.\u201d", "Having heard Agastya\u2019s marvellous story, Raghava, full of reverence and admiration, began to question him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Blessed One, why are there no wild beasts or birds in this forest where the King of Vidarbha, Shveta, used to practise that rigid penance?

On account of his lack of virtue, the king named him Danda, thinking that the rod (Danda) would inevitably fall on him.", "\u201cAs the monarch was unable to find a province suitable for his son, O Raghava, Conqueror of Your Foes, he carved out a territory for him between the Vindhya and Shaivala Mountains. Danda became king and there built an incomparably beautiful city on that charming site surrounded by mountains. He named that city Madhumanta, O Lord, and chose Shukra Deva of pious practices as his spiritual preceptor. Danda with his Guru ruled over that city inhabited by happy people as the King of the Gods in heaven.

It is for you to act honestly regarding me, in accord with the law of dharma, O Prince. Do you first approach my father and ask for my hand or fearful consequences will follow thine act. In his wrath, my father will consume the Three Worlds themselves, O You of faultless form; if, however, you ask for my hand, he will bestow it on you.\u2019", "\u201cThus spoke Aruja, but Danda, who had fallen under the sway of desire, with joined palms, answered her in his frenzy, saying:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Grant me your favours, O Charming One, do not delay, on thine account my breath is being extinguished, O You of lovely countenance. Having united myself with you, what care I if death or the most terrible retribution follow?

Wherever there were male beings or trees in the forest, whatsoever there was, assumed a female form. King Ila, the son of Kardama penetrated into that place slaying innumerable beasts and he observed that they were all female, thereafter he became aware that he too was changed into a woman, as also his followers.

That lady of irreproachable and pure conduct, to whom her lord is a God, will give proof of her good frith, O You who didst fear public condemnation! O Foremost of Men, here is that lady whom I proclaim to be essentially chaste, I whose vision is divinely illumined and who, though she was supremely dear to you and her innocence well known, you didst repudiate when your spirit was troubled by the censure of the people!\u201d", "Thus spoke Valmiki, and Raghava, on seeing that fair-complexioned princess, with joined palms, answered in the presence of the assembly:\u2014", "\u201cO Fortunate and virtuous Brahmin, may it be so! I fully concur in thine irreproachable words. This assurance was formerly given to me by Vaidehi in the presence of the Gods and, believing in that oath, I reinstated her in my house, but great indeed was the public condemnation, therefore I sent Maithili away. O Brahmin, though wholly convinced of her innocence, it was from fear of the people that I cast off Sita, do you pardon me! I acknowledge these twins, Kusha and Lava, to be my sons! I desire to make my peace with the chaste Maithili amidst the assembly.\u201d", "Hearing of his intention, the foremost of the Gods, led by Brahma, all assembled there to witness Sita\u2019s defence, and Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Vishvadevas, the hosts of the Maruts and all the great Rishis, Nagas, Sadhyas, Supamas and Siddhas gathered with delight. Beholding the Gods and the Sages, the foremost of men, Raghava, once more affirmed: \u201cI am in agreement with the irreproachable words of the Rishi Valmiki! I wish to be reconciled with the chaste Vaidehi in the presence of this assembly.\u201d", "The defence of Sita filled all who witnessed it with emotion and, at that moment, Vayu, the foremost of the Gods, sent forth a pure and fragrant breeze to the great delight of the assembly, as formerly in the Golden Age, and, it appeared marvellous to all those people from many lands who experienced it!", "Beholding that assembly, Sita, attired in a yellow robe, with joined palms, her head bowed, her eyes lowered, said:\u2014", "\u201cIf, in thought, I have never dwelt on any but Rama, may the Goddess Madhavi [i.e., The Earth Goddess, also called Dharani] receive me!\u201d", "As Vaidehi was still speaking, a miracle took place and, from the earth rose a marvellous celestial throne supported on the heads of Nagas of immeasurable power, their bodies adorned with divine gems. The Goddess Dharani, bidding her welcome, took Maithili in her arms, causing her to be seated on that celestial seat and, while she occupied the throne, a shower of blossoms fell without ceasing from the sky. Then the Gods burst into loud acclamations, crying \u201cExcellent! Excellent! O Sita, your virtue is supreme!\u201d", "From the heavens, the Gods, with delighted hearts, beholding Sita descend into the earth, praised her again and again, and at the place of sacrifice, where all were assembled, Sages, kings and the foremost of men were unable to recover from their astonishment. In the sky, on earth and in the nether regions, all beings, animate and inanimate, Danavas of vast stature and the foremost of the Pannagas cried out in delight, whilst others remained absorbed in their thoughts or gazed on Rama and on Sita in ecstasy. The entire assembly witnessed Sita\u2019s descent into the earth and, at that moment, a great tremor passed through the whole world.", "When Vaidehi had descended into the earth, all the monkeys and Sages cried out in Rama\u2019s presence, \u201cExcellent! Excellent\u201d but Rama, deeply distressed, supporting himself on a staff employed in the sacrifice, his eyes veiled with tears, his head bowed, was overcome with grief. Sighing again and again, letting fall many tears, a prey to pain and wrath, he said:\u2014", "\u201cBeholding Sita, the personification of Shri, vanish in my presence, my soul experiences an agony hitherto unknown. Formerly, when she was in Lanka, on the further side of the vast ocean, I brought her back, how much more easily shall I be able to wrest her from the bosom of the earth! O Goddess Vasuda, give me back my Sita, whom you retainest, or you shalt witness my wrath 1 You should know me since you are assuredly my mother-in-law and Maithili rose from you when Janaka was following the plough. Therefore let Sita go or open thyself to me that I may dwell with her in Patala or else in Nakaprishtha! Bring back Maithili on whose account I am distraught 1 If you failest to return Sita to me in her original form, I shall plough you up with your mountains and forests and shall destroy you so that nothing but water remains 1\u201d", "Thus spoke Kakutstha, full of wrath and grief, and Brahma, accompanied by the Hosts of the Gods, addressed the son of Raghu, saying:\u2014", "\u201cO Rama, virtuous Rama, do not be incensed, recollect your divine origin and nature, O Scourge of Your Foes! Assuredly, O Prince, I do not need to remind you that no-one is superior to you! Now recall that you are Vishnu, O Invincible Hero! The chaste and virtuous Sita, who was wholly absorbed in you formerly, has happily reached the region of the Nagas, by virtue of her ascetic practices. You will undoubtedly be re-united with her in the Celestial Realm. O Rama, hear, in the assembly, what I relate in this poem, the most beautiful of epics, recited in thine honour, I will make all known to you in detail, do not doubt it. In this poem of Valmiki all is included from the time of your birth, O Hero, the good and evil that has visited you and what will happen in the future. That great poet, O Rama, is wholly devoted to you, none other is worthy of the honour bestowed by poets save Raghava. Formerly, in company with the Gods, I heard the entire classic; it is divine, marvellously beautiful, true, and the remover of nescience. O Foremost of Men, O Supremely Virtuous Kakutstha, listen to the conclusion of the Ramayana and what concerns the future. Listen now with the Rishis, O Doughty and Illustrious Prince, to the end of this sublime poem entitled \u2018Uttara\u2019. Assuredly, O Kakutstha, this excellent epilogue may not be heard by any other save you, who art the supreme Sage, O Hero, O Joy of the House of Raghu.\u201d", "Having spoken thus, Brahma, the Lord of the Three Worlds, returned to his abode with his followers, the Gods.", "Meantime the magnanimous and high-souled Rishis, whose abode was Brahmaloka, at Brahma\u2019s command, remained, desirous of hearing \u2018Uttara kanda\u2019 and what should happen to Raghava.", "Having listened to the significant words of that God of Gods, the illustrious Rama said to Valmiki:\u2014", "\u201cO Blessed One, the Rishis of Brahmaloka desire to listen to \u2018Uttara kanda\u2019 and all that shall happen to me; to-morrow let it be narrated by you!\u201d", "Having resolved thus, Rama sought out Kusha and Lava and, dismissing the company, returned with them to the leaf-thatched hut of the Rishi Valmiki, where he passed the night lamenting for Sita.", "When night had given way to dawn, Rama called together the great ascetics and said to his two sons:\u2014", "\u201cNow sing without anxiety,\u201d and when those great and magnanimous Sages were seated, Kusha and Lava sang the epilogue to the \u2018Ramayana.\u2019", "Sita, having re-entered the earth, thus proving her fidelity, and the sacrifice being completed, Rama, in the extremity of grief, not beholding Vaidehi, regarded the world as a desert, and he dismissed the kings, bears, monkeys and titans and the host of leading brahmins, having loaded them with treasure.", "Taking leave of them, the lotus-eyed Rama, who was ever absorbed in the thought of Sita, returned to Ayodhya. The Joy of the House of Raghu never sought another consort but, in every sacrifice, he set up a golden image of Janaki in her stead. For ten thousand years, Rama performed the Vajamedha Sacrifice and the Vajapeya, ten times more, distributing quantities of gold, and that fortunate One also performed the Agnisthoma, Atiratra and Gosava Sacrifices, giving away abundant charity.", "For a long time, the magnanimous Raghava occupied the throne, his heart fixed in his duty; bears, monkeys and titans were subject to his rule and monarchs came daily to pay him homage. Parjanya sent rains in the proper season and it was abundant, the skies were clear, the regions sinless, the city and country abounding in cheerful and satisfied people. None died prematurely nor was there any disease, and in Rama\u2019s reign, none were destitute.", "After many years however, Rama\u2019s aged mother, surrounded by her sons and grandsons, passed away and she was followed by Sumitra and the renowned Kaikeyi, who having performed many righteous acts went to the celestial region, where those happy Ones were re-united with Dasaratha and received the fruit of their merit in heaven.", "From time to time, in memory of his mother, Raghava distributed gifts to the brahmins vowed to asceticism, and the virtuous Rama offered up obsequies accompanied by gifts of gems to the Sages and performed incomparable austerities in honour of his ancestors.", "Thus thousands of years passed happily during which, with the aid of sacrifices, that prince promoted the execution of duty in all its aspects.", "One day, Yudhajita, the King of Kaikaya, sent his spiritual Preceptor, Gargya, the son of Angiras, a Brahmarishi of immeasurable glory, to the magnanimous Raghava, with ten thousand horses as a token of his unsurpassed affection, and also carpets, gems, diverse splendid stuffs and brilliant ornaments; such were the gifts bestowed on Rama by that monarch.", "Hearing of the arrival of that great Rishi Gargya with those magnificent presents from Ashvapati, his maternal uncle, the virtuous Raghava went out with his suite to meet him to the distance of a mile, and he offered homage to him, as Shakra pays obeisance to Brihaspati.", "Having paid salutations to the Rishi and accepted the gifts, he enquired of him fully regarding the welfare of his mother\u2019s brother and family. Ushering the blessed Rishi into his palace, Rama began to question him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat message has my uncle confided to you in sending you hither?\u201d", "Having come there, that great Rishi, hearing Rama\u2019s words, unfolded his mission in eloquent terms, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThis, O Long-armed Hero, is what your maternal uncle, Yudhajita, in his affection for you, requests you to hear. There is a country of the Gandharvas, rich in fruit and roots, situated on the banks of the Sindhu River; that country is extremely fertile. The Gandharvas, armed and skilful warriors, defend it. When you have conquered them, O Virtuous Kakutstha and destroyed their magnificent citadels, take possession of their cities, which are well constructed. None other can achieve this; the country is extremely beautiful; do you follow my counsel, it is to thine advantage.\u201d", "This speech of his uncle\u2019s, conveyed by the great Rishi, pleased Raghava who replied \u201cSo be it 1\u201d and he glanced at Bharata; thereafter, delighted, Raghava, with joined palms, spoke again to that Twice-born, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThese two youthful princes will explore the country, O BrahmarishiI Bharata is the father of these valiant youths, Taksha and Pushkala. Under the protection of my uncle, they will show themselves to be devoted in the discharge of their duty. With Bharata at their head, those two youthful princes, accompanied by their troops, will slay the sons of the Gand-harvas and take possession of the two cities. Having subdued those two great capitals and installed his two sons, my very virtuous brother will return once more.\u201d", "Thus did Rama speak to that Brahmarishi, and thereafter issued orders to Bharata to start out with his army, having first installed those youthful princes.", "Under the constellation Saumya [i.e., The planet Mercury], preceded by the son of Angiras, Bharata set out with his troops and his two sons, and it seemed as if that army, leaving Ayodhya, followed to a great distance by Raghava, could not have been approached even by the Gods themselves. Then those beings who live on flesh, and titans of colossal stature, followed in Bharara\u2019s train, thirsting for blood, and the redoubtable Bhutagramas, in their desire to devour the corpses of the Gandharvas, came in hundreds and thousands, and lions, tigers, boars and birds in countless numbers preceded the troops. In a month and a half, that army composed of cheerful and healthy warriors reached the Kingdom of Kaikeya.", "Hearing of the arrival of Bharata at the head of a vast army accompanied by Gargya, the King of the Kaikeyas, Yudhajita, experienced supreme joy and set out in all haste with a great company against the Gandharvas.", "Bharata and Yudhajita, having joined forces, approached the City of the Gandharvas with their swift troops and followers, whereupon, learning of the invasion, the Gandharvas assembled, eager for combat, full of vigour and shouting on every side.", "Then a terrible battle of appalling violence ensued, lasting seven days, without victory being decisive for either army. Rivers of blood, floating with corpses, streamed on every side, scimitars and spears being the crocodiles. Thereafter Bharata, the younger brother of Rama, enraged, loosed a terrible shaft propelled by mantras, named Samvarta [i.e., A weapon with which Kala or Time destroys the worlds], on the Gandharvas. Caught in the noose of destruction, three hundred thousand Gandharvas were slain in an instant, cut to pieces by that hero. The inhabitants of the Celestial Region were unable to remember such a fearful conflict in which, in the twinkling of an eye, so vast a number of warriors perished.", "The Gandharvas all being slain, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi entered those two opulent and magnificent cities, and there, Bharata established Taksha in Takshashila and Pushkala in Pushkalavata, in the country of the Gandharvas, in the ravishing region of Gandhara. Overflowing with treasure and precious gems, adorned with groves, they seemed to vie with each other in magnificence.", "For five years the long-armed Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, occupied those capitals of supreme beauty, whose inhabitants were of irreproachable conduct, and thereafter he returned to Ayodhya. Those cities with their innumerable parks, filled with vehicles and well-stocked markets, enchanting beyond imagining, were embellished by fabulous buildings and countless palaces, resplendent with a multitude of magnificent temples and adorned with Tala, Tamala, Tilaka, and Bakula Trees.", "Then the fortunate Bharata paid obeisance to the magnanimous Raghava, who was Dharma personified, as Vasava offers salutations to Brahma, and Raghava listened with satisfaction when Bharata told him of the total extermination of the Gandharvas which had taken place and of the occupation of their territory.", "Hearing those tidings, Rama with his brothers rejoiced and he uttered these memorable words in their presence:\u2014", "\u201cYour two youthful sons, Angada and Candraketu, are worthy to reign, O Saumitri, for they are strong and energetic; I shall install them both as kings! Come, find these two valiant Ones a pleasant region which is not confined, where there is no danger of treachery from hostile monarchs, where they may live at ease and where the ascetics\u2019 retreats are not despoiled! O Friend, seek out such a country without causing injury to any!\u201d", "Thus spoke Rama, and Bharata answered:\u2014", "\u201cThere is a charming and healthy region named Karupatta; let two cities that are salubrious and beautiful be established there for the magnanimous Angada and Candraketu which shall be called Angadiya and Candrakanta.\u201d", "These words of Bharata were approved by Raghava, and he brought that country under his rule and established Angada therein. The City of Angadiya was built for Angada by Rama of imperishable deeds and it was splendid and well fortified. As for Candraketu, who was a giant, his uncle built Candrakanta for him in the country of the Mallas, and that capital was celestial and equal to Amaravati.", "Thereafter, greatly delighted, Rama, Lakshmana and Bharata, those invincible warriors, attended the installation of those two youthful princes who, having received the divine unction, fixed in their duty, divided the territory, and Angada had the western and Candraketu the northern region. Angada was accompanied by Sumitra\u2019s son [i.e., Shatrughna], whilst Lakshmana and Bharata followed in Candraketu\u2019s train.", "His sons being firmly established on the throne, Lakshmana took the road back to Ayodhya, having sojourned in Angadiya for a year. On his side, Bharata remained with Candraketu one year more, thereafter returning to Ayodhya to take up his place again at Rama\u2019s feet.", "Both Saumitri and Bharata, in their love for him and their extreme piety, forgot that rime was passing and thus ten thousand years went by while they devoted themselves to affairs of state. Employing their days in this wise, their hearts satisfied, surrounded with splendour, dwelling together in that righteous city, they resembled the Three Fires whose flames are fed with abundant libations amidst great solemnity.", "After a long time, Death, in the form of an ascetic, presented himself at the gates of the great and virtuous Rama and said:\u2014", "\u201cI am a messenger from an all-powerful Maharishi and have come to see Rama on a matter of great importance.\u201d", "Hearing these words, Saumitri hastened to announce the arrival of the ascetic to Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cMayest you extend your dominion over both worlds, O Illustrious Prince! A Messenger has come to see you, who, by virtue of his penances, is as radiant as the sun.\u201d", "Hearing Lakshmana\u2019s words, Rama said:\u2014", "\u201cBring in that ascetic of great effulgence, who carries a message from his master, O Dear Brother!\u201d", "Then Saumitri answered: \u201cBe it so!\u201d and ushered in that Sage, flaming in splendour, surrounded as it were with burning rays. Approaching the foremost of the Raghus, who shone in his own effulgence, the Rishi, in an harmonious voice, addressed Raghava, saying:\u2014\u201cMay felicity be thine!\u201d", "Then the supremely illustrious Rama, having paid him the traditional homage and offered him the Arghya, enquired of him concerning his state. Having informed Rama of his wellbeing, the most skilled of orators, that illustrious ascetic seated himself on a golden throne and thereafter Rama said to him:\u2014", "\u201cBe you welcome, O Great Sage, what message hast you for me, since you dost come as an ambassador?\u201d", "On this enquiry from that Lion among Men, the Sage said to him:\u2014", "\u201cIf you dost revere the wishes of the Gods, this meeting must take place between us alone; whoever shall overhear us should be put to death by you; the words of the Lord of the Ascetics are secret and should be revered by You.\u201d", "\u201cBe it so I\u201d replied Rama, and having given this assurance, he issued the following command to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cDo you stand at the door, O Long-armed Warrior and dismiss the door-keeper. It is for me to slay whoever hears the converse between this Muni and myself, for it must take place between us alone.\u201d", "Having sent Lakshmana to guard the door, Kakutstha, born of Raghu, said:\u2014", "\u201cO Ascetic, you canst now disclose that with which you have been charged, speak without fear, I shall treasure it in my heart!\u201d", "\u201cLearn, O Magnanimous Sovereign, that this is the purpose of my coming! It is the blessed Grandsire who has sent me, O Mighty Prince. I was his son in a former existence, O Conqueror of Hostile Citadels! Born of Maya, O Hero, I am Death who destroys all!", "The Grandsire, Lord of the Worlds, speaks thus to you:\u2014", "\u201c\u2018Your task is accomplished, O Friend, O Protector of the Worlds! Having formerly destroyed all beings by the aid of Maya, lying amidst the waters of the vast ocean, you didst give me birth. You had already created the Serpent of large coils, Ananta, as also two mighty Beings, Madhu and Kaitabha, whose crushed bones covered the earth which appeared at that time with its chain of mountains. From a celestial lotus, bright as the sun, that issued from your navel, you didst produce me and give me the task of creating the world. Since you have charged me with this burden, I lean on you for support, O Lord of the Earth 1 Do you watch over all beings, for it is you who art my strength. By virtue of thine invincible and eternal nature, you should afford protection to all creation, for you have assumed the form of Vishnu! O Mighty Son of Aditi, you didst enhance the power of your brothers and when they sought to accomplish their tasks, you didst come to their aid. When, O Prince, all creatures were being exterminated by Ravana, you, desiring to slay him, bethought thyself of men. Then you didst resolve to dwell among them in person for eleven thousand years and thereafter return to us. You, who art mind-born, hast completed your stay among mortals; it is the hour, O Foremost of Men, to return to us; if it is your desire to prolong your sojourn among creatures, O Great King, do so and be happy!\u2019", "\u201cSuch are the words of the Grandsire:\u2014", "\u2018If you preferest to enter into possession of the world of the Gods once more, O Raghava, they with their leaders will be freed from all anxiety, since Vishnu will be amongst them.\u2019\u201d", "Having heard the words of the Grandsire, which Death communicated to him, Raghava, smiling, answered the Destroyer of the Worlds, saying:\u2014", "\u201cThese wholly admirable words of that God of Gods assuredly causes me supreme delight, as also your coming hither. I came for the good of the worlds, this is the purpose of my being; mayest you be happy! Thine advent here has moved my heart; I shall leave without delay. The Grandsire has uttered what is true, I must attend to all that concerns the Gods under my dominion, O Destroyer of the Universe!\u201d", "As the two were conversing thus, Durvasa, that blessed Sage, who wished to see Rama, came to the gate of the palace and, approaching Saumitri, that illustrious ascetic said:\u2014", "\u201cBring me straightway into Rama\u2019s presence, the affair is urgent!\u201d", "So spoke the magnanimous Sage, and Lakshmana, the Slayer of His Foes, bowing low, said to him:\u2014", "\u201cWhat is this matter? Explain thyself, O Blessed Sage! What can I do for you? Raghava is occupied, O Brahmin, have patience awhile!\u201d", "Hearing this reply from that lion among men, the great Rishi, highly incensed, said to Lakshmana, whom he seemed to consume with his glance:\u2014", "\u201cAnnounce my presence here to Rama immediately, O Saumitri, or I shall pronounce a curse on the kingdom, on you, the city, on Raghava, Bharata and on your House! O Saumitri, I can no longer contain mine indignation!\u201d", "Having heard the mighty ascetic\u2019s alarming words, Lakshmana pondered awhile within himself concerning their significance, and reflected:\u2014", "\u201cIt were better that I should perish than all others be destroyed!\u201d", "On this, he made the arrival of the ascetic known to Raghava and, Rama hearing the tidings, took leave of Death and, in all haste, sought out the son of Atri. Having paid obeisance with joined palms to that great Sage flaming in effulgence, he enquired of him, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWhat may I do for you?\u201d", "On this enquiry from that King of Ascetics, the Sage Durvasa answered:\u2014", "\u201cO Virtuous Rama, hear me, this day I have concluded a fast of a thousand years. O Irreproachable Raghava, now give me what you have ready to eat!\u201d", "At these words, the King Raghava, with a delighted heart, offered the foremost of Sages dishes, that had been made ready, and that ascetic, having partaken of that food like unto Amrita, addressed Rama, saying:\u2014", "\u201cIt is well!\u201d and returned to his hermitage.", "Thereafter Rama called to mind the words of Death at that portentous meeting and, with bowed head, his heart wrung with anguish, he was unable to speak. Reflecting again and again within himself, the illustrious Raghava thought, \u201cAll is lost!\u201d and fell silent.", "Seeing Rama, his head bowed, afflicted and like unto the moon in eclipse, Lakshmana spoke to him in cheerful and affectionate tones, saying:\u2014", "\u201cYou should not grieve on mine account, O Long-armed Warrior; thus was it already ordained and has its roots in a past cause! Slay me without hesitation, be faithful to your vow! Those who do not honour their promise, go to hell! If you have any affection for me, O Great King, and dost find any merit in me, then slay me and fulfil the law, O Raghava!\u201d", "Thus spoke Lakshmana, and Rama, his mind troubled, called his ministers and priests together and told them what had taken place, of the arrival of Durvasa and the vow he had made to the Ascetic. When they had heard these things, the ministers and brahmins became silent, nevertheless the illustrious Vasishtha spoke thus:\u2014", "\u201cO Long-armed Prince, I perceive that the separation from Lakshmana is for you a calamity, causing your hair to stand on end. O Illustrious Rama, do you abandon him; death is powerful, let not your words prove false. When a promise is not honoured and virtue is destroyed, undoubtedly the Three Worlds with all animate and inanimate beings, with the hosts of the Gods and Rishis, perish! Therefore, O Lion among Men, in order to save the Three Worlds and assure the continuance of the universe, banish Lakshmana!\u201d", "Hearing these words, which were in accord with duty and righteousness, approved by all, Rama, in the midst of the assembly, said to Lakshmana:\u2014", "\u201cLest righteousness should perish, I banish you, O Saumitri, a sentence of banishment or death is the same to men of honour!\u201d", "At this decree of Rama\u2019s, Lakshmana, weeping, his mind distracted, departed in all haste without returning to his home.", "Having reached the banks of the Sarayu River, he performed his ablutions and, with joined palms, closing the doors of the senses, he began to meditate. As he was thus restraining his senses, he did not release his breath while given up to contemplation, and the Gods with their leaders, the troops of Apsaras and companies of Rishis covered him with a rain of flowers. Becoming invisible to men, the mighty Lakshmana was borne away in the body by Shakra, who carried him to the Celestial Region. Beholding the fourth part of Vishnu entering heaven, the foremost of the Gods, delighted, joyfully and unitedly offered homage to that descendant of Raghu.", "Having banished Lakshmana, Rama, a prey to grief and desolation, said to his priests, ministers and citizens:\u2014", "\u201cTo-day I shall give the royal annointing to the valiant Bharata, who is faithful to his duty, and make him Lord of Ayodhya; thereafter I shall go to the forest. Make all preparations, lose no time, for to-day I too shall follow the path that Lakshmana has taken!\u201d", "Thus spoke Raghava and his subjects bowed low as if deprived of all strength. On his side, Bharata, beside himself on hearing his brother\u2019s speech, refused the crown and expressed himself thus:\u2014", "\u201cI swear in truth, O King, without you I do not wish to reign, even in Svarga, O You, the Joy of the Raghus! Establish your two sons, the valiant Kusha and Lava in the Southern Koshalas and the Northern Regions; send swift messengers to Shatrughna to announce our departure, let there be no delay!\u201d", "Hearing these words of Bharata and also beholding the citizens who, their heads bowed, were overwhelmed with grief, Vasishtha spoke:\u2014", "\u201cO Beloved Rama, see how these people are prostrating themselves, having learnt what they desire, fulfill it, do not grieve them I\u201d", "Thus spoke Vasishtha and Kakutstha, having caused them to rise, said to the people, \u201cWhat is asked of me?\u201d and they all said to him:\u2014", "\u201cIf you are leaving us, let us accompany you wheresoever you goest, O Rama; if you dost love your subjects and that affection is unsurpassed, let us, with our sons and wives, follow the righteous path with you; whether it be to an inaccessible retreat, river or ocean, you should not abandon us; lead us all wherever you will, O You our Master I This is our supreme desire, our most cherished wish; it will always be the delight of our hearts to accompany you, O Prince!\u201d", "Recognizing his people\u2019s profound attachment, Rama answered, \u201cSo be it!\u201d and occupied himself in carrying through what he had undertaken that day.", "He gave over the Southern Koshalas to the valiant Kusha and those of the north to Lava; thereafter, placing those two princes on his lap, he enthroned them in Ayodhya and bestowed upon them thousands of chariots and numberless elephants with ten thousand horses. Having furnished them with jewels and treasure in abundance and given them cheerful and healthy people to attend upon them, he sent the two brothers, Kusha and Lava, each to his own capital.", "Those two heroes being installed in their respective cities, Rama sent out an emissary to the magnanimous Shatrughna.", "The messengers, urged on by Rama\u2019s command, swiftly and promptly went to Madhura without halting on the way. After three nights they reached that city where they all informed Shatrughna what had happened; the banishing of Lakshmana, Raghava\u2019s vow, the installation of his two sons and the resolution of his subjects to follow him; how an enchanting city had been built for Kusha under the name of Kushavati on the high ridge of the Vindhya Mountains by the virtuous Rama, and that Shravasti was the name of the ravishing and famous capital of Lava; they told him also of the preparations made by Raghava and Bharata to take all the people from Ayodhya and enter Svarga.", "Having related all these things to the magnanimous Shatrughna, the messengers became silent and thereafter added, \u201cMake all haste, O King!\u201d", "Hearing these fearful tidings regarding the imminent destruction of his entire House, Shatrughna, the Joy of Raghu, called his people together and summoned his family priest, Kancana, in order to impart the truth to them of his immediate departure with his brothers.", "Thereafter, that valiant prince installed his two sons, having distributed abundant wealth equally amongst them, and Subahu was established in Madhura and Shatrughatin in Vaidisha. This being accomplished, that descendant of Raghu left for Ayodhya in a single chariot.", "There he beheld the magnanimous Rama like unto a flaming brazier, clothed in a robe of fine wool, in the midst of the imperishable Sages. Paying obeisance to them with joined palms, his senses under control, he addressed his virtuous brother, whose thought too was ever fixed on his duty, and said:\u2014", "\u201cI have enthroned my two sons, O King, and have come hither; know well that I am resolved to follow you! Do not oppose me, O Valiant One, for I would not that your will should be disregarded by one like me.\u201d", "Seeing his resolve was fixed, Rama said to Shatrughna, \u201cSo be it.\u201d", "Having ceased from speaking, the monkeys, who were able to change their form at will, with the companies of bears and titans came there from all directions with Sugriva at their head, all being united in their desire to behold Rama, who stood with his face turned towards the sky.", "Devas, Rishis and Gandharvas with their offspring, hearing of Rama\u2019s intended departure, had all assembled, saying:\u2014", "\u201cWe have come here to follow you, O Prince! T o leave without us, O Rama is to strike us down with the Rod of Death.\u201d", "At that instant, the supremely powerful Sugriva, bowing before that hero in accord with tradition, addressed him with humility and said:\u2014", "\u201cHaving installed the virtuous Angada, O Prince, know that I have come hither with the intention of accompanying you!\u201d", "At these words, the illustrious Kakutstha smiling, answered:\u2014", "\u201cSo be it 1\u201d Thereafter he said to Bibishana, the King of the Rakshasas:\u2014", "\u201cAs long as people exist, O Mighty Lord of the Rakshasas, do you remain in Lanka. As long as the moon and sun continue to shine on the earth, as long as they speak of me in the world, so long shall thine empire endure; this is the will of your friend, do you obey! Govern your people according to justice and do not question this further. One thing more I wish to say to you, O Mighty Monarch of the Rakshasas, do you worship the Divinity of the House of Ikshvaku, the Guide of the Universe, Shri Jagannath, whom the Devas themselves with their leaders perpetually adore.\u201d", "\u201cSo shall it be,\u201d answered Bibishana, and Kakutstha thereafter addressed Hanuman, saying:\u2014", "\u201cResign thyself to continuing to live, do not render my will void. As long as my story is told in the world, O Foremost of Monkeys, so long mayest you be happy and remember my words!\u201d", "Thereupon Hanuman, acquiescing in Rama\u2019s utterance, in his delight, said:\u2014", "\u201cAs long as your purifying history is circulated in the world, so long O Rama, shall I remain on earth submissive to your will!\u201d", "Then Raghava issued the same command to Jambavan and said:\u2014", "\u201cTill the Kali Yuga begins, continue to dwell on earth!\u201d", "Thereafter, addressing all the other bears and monkeys, he said:\u2014", "\u201cIf it be your desire, then follow me!\u201d", "When the dawn broke, the broad-chested and illustrious Rama, whose eyes were as large as lotus petals, said to his spiritual Preceptor", "\u201cLet the Agnihotra burning brightly with the Twice-born and also the sacrificial canopy be borne in advance and you, My Lord, precede them on this great journey.\u201d", "Thereupon Vasishtha, full of majesty, performed the prescribed rituals related to the Mahaprasthana without omitting anything. Then Rama, clothed in fine silk, invoking Brahma and reciting the Vedic Mantras, taking Kusha Grass in both his hands, set out for the Sarayu River, halting from time to time, silently making his way along the rough path, Radiant as the sun, he issued from his palace barefooted and, on his right, walked Shri Lakshmi with her lotus, on his left, was the great Goddess Vyavasaya [i.e., The Goddess of the Earth] and, assuming human form, his innumerable arrows, marvellous bow and all the other weapons accompanied him. The Vedas, in the persons of brahmins, the Holy Gayatri, Protector of the World, the sacred syllable \u201caum\u201d and the invocation \u201cVashat\u201d followed in Rama\u2019s train as also the great-souled Rishis, and all the Deities of the Earth accompanied that hero to the open gates of heaven.", "In his steps trod the women of the inner apartments with the aged, the children, servants, eunuchs and personal attendants. The faithful Bharata with his wives accompanied by Shatrughna followed in Rama\u2019s train, attended by the sacrificial fire. All the magnanimous Sages with the ritualistic articles, having assembled there with their sons and wives, joined the procession of the virtuous Kakutstha. Ministers, groups of servants with their offspring, their kinsmen and their flocks joyfully followed in the footsteps of their master. All the citizens, happy and healthy people, distinguished by their good qualities, joined Raghava\u2019s departure and all the men and women with their birds, beasts and friends, purified of their sins, went forward cheerfully. Devoted to Rama, the Monkeys, having bathed, delighted and satisfied, cried out exultantly with all their strength, \u201cKilakila!\u201d", "In that multitude, none was sad, downcast or unhappy, but a universal felicity filled all to the highest degree. In their desire to behold Rama taking his departure, the people of the country, through which he passed, on seeing him, took their places in his train. Bears, monkeys, titans, citizens, with deep devotion, followed him in the utmost serenity. Even the invisible Beings of the city joined Raghava\u2019s procession when he went to heaven. Beholding him, all creatures, animate and inanimate, lovingly accompanied him on that journey. Not a single being, not even the least of them, was to be seen in Ayodhya; even those born of animals followed in Rama\u2019s wake.", "When he had proceeded about six miles, the Pride of the Raghus beheld the sacred waters of the Sarayu flowing westwards, eddying and rippling in their course, and he went on further to the Goprataraka Ghata, his subjects thronging round him on all sides.", "At that moment, as Kakutstha was preparing to ascend to heaven, Brahma, the Grandsire of the World, surrounded by the Gods and the illustrious Rishis adorned with jewels, appeared seated in their aerial chariots, and the whole firmament glowed with a transcendent splendour, a marvellous radiance emanating from the lustre of those heavenly beings of virtuous deeds. Pure, balmy and fragrant breezes blew, whilst shower upon shower of blossom was scattered by the Gods. Thereafter to the sound of a myriad instruments and the singing of the Gandharvas and Apsaras, Rama stepped into the waters, where.-upon the Grandsire, from on high, uttered these words:\u2014", "\u201cHail O Vishnu! Hail O Raghava! With your God-like brothers, now enter thine eternal abode 1 Return to thine own body if you so desirest, O Long-armed Warrior! Occupy the realm of Vishnu or the shining ether, O Mighty God! You are the support of the world, though there are some who do not recognize You without the large-eyed Maya, thine ancient Consort! You are the Inconceivable One, the Great Being, the Indestructible, the Ageless One. Enter into your real body if You so desirest.\u201d", "Hearing these words of the Grandsire, the supremely virtuous Rama formed his resolution and entered Vishnu\u2019s abode in his body with his younger brothers.", "Thereupon Immortals began to worship that God who had returned to His form as Vishnu, and the Sadhyas, the hosts of Maruts with Indra and Agni at their head, the celestial companies of Rishis, the Gandharvas and Apsaras, Supamas, Nagas, Yakshas, Daityas, Danavas and Rakshasas and all the dwellers in heaven felt a supreme delight, their desires fulfilled, their sins washed away, and they cried out \u201cHail! All Hail!\u201d", "Then the all-resplendent Vishnu said to the Grandsire:\u2014", "\u201cGrant to each of these my subjects a suitable abode. They are my devotees and truly deserving, having sacrificed their lives for me!\u201d", "Thus spoke Vishnu, and the God Brahma, Guru of the Worlds, answered saying:\u2014", "\u201cAll those who have assembled here shall go to the region called Santanakas! Yea, even the beasts who die meditating on Your holy Feet shall live in the vicinity of Brahmaloka where I have united all pleasurable things. The monkeys and the bears, the manifestations of various Deities have already returned to the worlds of the Gods, from whence they came forth, and Sugriva has entered the disc of the sun!\u201d", "Even as the great God was speaking, the monkeys and the bears, having assumed their pristine forms, came to Goprataraka Ghata before the eyes of the assembled Gods. At that time, whosoever entered the waters of the Sarayu River, yielded up their lives gladly, their eyes suffused with tears of ecstasy, and, having abandoned their bodies, took their places in a celestial chariot. As for those in animal form, who entered the waters of the Sarayu in hundreds, they ascended to the Third Heaven in divinely resplendent bodies and they appeared as effulgent as the Gods in their celestial lineaments. All beings, whether animate or inanimate, who entered those waters attained to the region of the Gods, and, in their turn, the bears, monkeys and titans, abandoning their bodies in the river, also attained heaven.", "Having granted them all a place in paradise, the Grandsire of the World accompanied by the Gods, in the height of felicity, returned to the Third Heaven, his supreme abode.", "This then is the whole of the great epic and its sequel called the Ramayana, which was composed by Valmiki and is revered by Brahma Himself.", "The Lord Vishnu returned to Svargaloka as erstwhile, He Who pervades the Three Worlds and all they contain, both the moving and the fixed. Gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas and great Rishis in heaven, ever listen with delight to the poem \u2018Ramayana\u2019. This epic, which promotes long life, grants good fortune and destroys sin, is equal to the Veda and should be recited by the wise to men of faith.", "On hearing it, he who has no son will obtain a son, he who has no fortune will become wealthy; to read but a foot of this poem will absolve him from all sin. He who commits sins daily will be wholly purified by reciting a single sloka.", "The reciter of this narrative should be rewarded with raiment, cows and gold, for, if he is satisfied, all the Gods are satisfied. He who recites this epic \u2018Ramayana\u2019 that prolongs life, will be blessed with his sons and grandsons in this world and after his death, in the other world. He who, with devotion, recites the \u2018Ramayana\u2019 at the hour when the cows are loosed or at noon or at dusk, will never suffer adversity.", "The enchanting City of Ayodhya, having remained deserted for countless years, will be re-peopled by a Prince named Rishabha.", "This narrative, that grants longevity, with the \u2018Bhavishya\u2019 and \u2018Uttara\u2019, whose author is the son of Pracetas, has the approval of Brahma Himself."]
