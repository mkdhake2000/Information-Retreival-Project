# **PREREQUISITES:**

1. **Python**
    - **Libraries:**
        1. Selenium
        2. Tesseract
        3. stanza
        4. translators
        5. spacy
        6. networkx
        7. matplotlib

        9. tqdm
        10. nltk
        11. pickle
        12. inltk

2. **Jupyter Notebook:**
    Jupyter notebook is a very popular and flexible development environment which lets us write and execute python code, display the output and any kind of visualization or plot, etc. in the same document. However, it is always advisable to install Python with Anaconda environment on your system as well.

3. **Ramayana:**
    Basic information about Ramayana will be helpful. We have included some information in the report.

# **STEPS TO FOLLOW BEFORE START:**

This project consists of 5 Python notebooks and required data.

The execution order of the files is as follows:
1. WebScrapping.ipynb
2. DataPreprocessing.ipynb
3. TenseClassification.ipynb
4. BM25.ipynb
5. KnowledgeGraph.ipynb

# **DESCRIPTION:**

The project Zip has two folders:
1. Codes
2. Datasets

**Codes:**

1. **WebScrapping.ipynb**
    - **Introduction:**
        This notebook connects to "https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-ramayana-of-valmiki" and gets the Ramayana English data by web scraping using Selenium webdriver into `Datasets/RamayanaEng.json` and `Datasets/RamayanaEngSen.json` in two different formats. Using this scraped data, it creates the Hindi translated Ramayana data, storing it in `Datasets/RamayanaHin.json`.

2. **DataPreprocessing.ipynb**
    - **Introduction:**
        This notebook takes the images of Hindi Ramayana PDF data, preprocesses and cleans it, and gives the `Datasets/RamayanaHi.json` Hindi dataset. It saves an intermediate result at `Datasets/ramayana.txt`. The first cell performs text extraction from images (which takes time). The size of the images is around 1.5 GB. So, we uploaded the `image_dataset` folder on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sF6xhVP4l95vGNLb6L3UmQ7DAu1IE_AU?usp=sharing). To re-run the first cell, please download the Google folder and put it in `Datasets` folder. The images are extracted from the following PDF: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Jl288loWkURMUJGKlG9sphMGsHU7O9p/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Jl288loWkURMUJGKlG9sphMGsHU7O9p/view?usp=sharing).

3. **TenseClassification.ipynb**
    - **Introduction:**
        This notebook takes the `RamayanaHi.json`, the PDF extracted dataset, and `Datasets/RamayanaHin.json`, the scraped translated dataset, and gives 3 files for both stored in `Datasets/HiFrompdf` and `Datasets/HiTranslated` folders respectively. The 3 files correspond to past, present, and future files for both.

4. **BM25.ipynb**
    - **Introduction:**
        This notebook performs BM25 scored retrieval on the events classified as past in the previous file. These past events from the current chapter are matched with all events from previous chapters, and top 5 relevant chapters are stored. The output is present in `Datasets/EventsMatched.json`.

5. **KnowledgeGraph.ipynb**
    - **Introduction:**
        This notebook creates a knowledge graph based on the `RamayanaEngSen.json` dataset.

You can refer to the notebooks for more details about each section

**Datasets:**

1. ramayana.txt
2. RamayanaEng.json
3. RamayanaEngSen.json
4. RamayanaHi.json
5. RamayanaHin.json

**Outputs/Mid-results:**

1. Chapters/*.txt
2. HinFrompdf/*.json
3. HinTranslated/*.json
4. EventsMatched.json
